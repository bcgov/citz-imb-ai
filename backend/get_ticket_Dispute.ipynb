      "HOW TO PAY THE TICKET: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PAY A PORTION OF A TICKETED AMOUNT OR DO NOT PAY AT ALL? \n",
      "If, within 30 days of the date of service of the ticket, you (a) pay a portion of the ticketed amount for an alleged offence, or (b) do not pay the ticketed amount for an alleged offence and do not dispute the alleged offence, you are deemed to have pleaded guilty to the offence. This will have the following consequences: you will be subject to collection activity; the offence will be added as a conviction to the records kept by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia; under section 26 of the Motor Vehicle Act, you may be refused a driver's licence or a licence and corresponding number plates for a motor vehicle or trailer or a permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW TO DISPUTE THE TICKET \n",
      "You can dispute an alleged offence set out in the non-shaded areas of the ticket or a fine or both by mailing a notice of dispute or appearing in person to give notice of dispute in accordance with the instructions below. Your notice of dispute must be mailed or given within 30 days of the date of service of the ticket. If you dispute an alleged offence, you or your agent will have to appear at a Provincial Court hearing. If you do not want to dispute an alleged offence but want to request a reduction in a fine or additional time to pay, you can avoid having to appear at a Provincial Court hearing by completing a Violation Ticket Statement and Written Reasons form. This form is available from gov.bc.ca or a Provincial Court registry. If you want to request a reduction in a fine or additional time to pay and do not complete a Violation Ticket Statement and Written Reasons form, you or your agent will have to appear at a Provincial Court hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW TO DISPUTE THE TICKET: DISPUTE BY MAIL \n",
      "You may mail a letter to the mailing address set out on the ticket saying that you want to dispute the ticket. The letter must identify any alleged offence or fine for any alleged offence that you are disputing and set out the address to which the Provincial Court will send your notice of hearing. You must include a copy of the ticket with your letter, or your letter must contain the violation ticket number, your name, address, driver's licence number and date of birth, the violation date and the name of the Act or regulation and section contravened for each alleged offence that you are disputing. If you do not provide these details in the letter or a copy of the ticket, it may not be possible to process your dispute. If this occurs, you will be deemed to have pleaded guilty to the alleged offence(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW TO DISPUTE THE TICKET: DISPUTE IN PERSON \n",
      "You may deliver your notice of dispute in person to the location indicated on the ticket or to any driver licensing office, Service BC office or Provincial Court registry. You will need to bring the ticket and you may be required to fill out a Notice of Dispute form as provided at that location.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW TO DISPUTE THE TICKET: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOUR NOTICE OF DISPUTE HAS BEEN RECEIVED? \n",
      "If you (a) dispute an alleged offence, or (b) submit a request for a reduction in a fine or an alleged offence or additional time to pay without including a completed Violation Ticket Statement and Written Reasons form, a notice of hearing will be sent to you in the mail from the Provincial Court registry. The notice will tell you the date, time and location for your Provincial Court hearing. If you or your agent does not appear at the Provincial Court hearing on the indicated date and time, the alleged offence is deemed not to be disputed and you are deemed to have pleaded guilty to the offence. This will have the following consequences: the ticketed amount is immediately payable to the government; the offence will be added as a conviction to the records kept by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia; under section 26 of the Motor Vehicle Act, you may be refused a driver's licence or a licence and corresponding number plates for a motor vehicle or trailer or a permit. If you submit a request for a reduction in a fine or additional time to pay and a completed Violation Ticket Statement and Written Reasons form, an order of a justice setting out the Court's decision will be sent to you in the mail.\n",
