						Nothing in this Code prevents a chief constable or a municipal police board from doing one or both of the following:</p><p class="para">(a) issuing an apology on behalf of the municipal police department concerned or, with the consent of the police officer concerned, on behalf of both the department and the police officer;</p><p class="para">(b) considering, proposing or implementing policy changes designed to prevent recurrence of a breach of this Code.</p></div><p xmlns:in="http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/2013/inline" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:oasis="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/oasis-exchange/table" xmlns:act="http://www.gov.bc.ca/2013/legislation/act" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" class="regnote"><strong>Note:</strong> this regulation repeals B.C.
