For an issuer that is not an investment fund, the term "interim period" has the meaning set out in NI 51-102.

The subject of an acquisition should be considered a business where there is, or the issuer expects there will be, continuity of operations. The issuer should consider:</p><p class="schIndent2">(a) whether the nature of the revenue producing activity or potential revenue producing activity will remain generally the same after the acquisition, and</p><p class="schIndent2">(b) whether any of the physical facilities, employees, marketing systems, sales forces, customers, operating rights, production techniques or trade names are acquired by the issuer instead of remaining with the vendor after the acquisition.</p><p class="schIndent1">8.

If technical terms are necessary, provide definitions.</p><p class="schIndent1">4. Address the items required by the form in the order set out in the form. However, it is not necessary to provide disclosure about an item that does not apply.</p><p class="schIndent1">5. The issuer may include additional information in the offering memorandum other than that specifically required by the form.

The issuer may wrap the offering memorandum around a prospectus or similar document. However, all matters required to be disclosed by the offering memorandum must be addressed and the offering memorandum must provide a cross-reference to the page number or heading in the wrapped document where the relevant information is contained. The certificate to the offering memorandum must be modified to indicate that the offering memorandum, including the document around which it is wrapped, does not contain a misrepresentation.</p><p class="schIndent1">7. It is an offence to make a misrepresentation in the offering memorandum. This applies both to information that is required by the form and to additional information that is provided.
