						A reduction in allowable annual cut imposed under subsection (2) (a) in a timber supply area must be apportioned among all the licences in that area, except exempt licences, in accordance with the following method:</p><p class="para">(a) first, calculate a reduction in allowable annual cut for each licence by distributing the part of the reduction under subsection (1) (a) that the minister may assign to the licences proportionately among them according to the relative sizes of the allowable annual cut specified in each licence;</p><p class="para">(b) second, calculate for each licence the annual volume of timber, if any, by which the calculations under this subsection reduce the allowable annual cut for that licence to less than the base level allowable annual cut;</p><p class="para">(c) third, calculate the aggregate of the annual volumes of timber calculated under paragraph (b);</p><p class="para">(d) fourth, for each licence for which the calculation under paragraph (b) does not reduce the allowable annual cut to less than the base level allowable annual cut, calculate a further reduction in allowable annual cut by distributing the amount determined under paragraph (c) proportionately among those licences according to the relative sizes of the allowable annual cut specified in each of them;</p><p class="para">(e) fifth, repeat the calculations under paragraphs (b) to (d) until the end result of all the calculations is that the allowable annual cut for any of the licences is not reduced to a level that is less than the base level allowable annual cut.</p><p class="sub">(5) 
						The minister or the chief forester, as the case may be, must serve a copy of an order made under this section on the holder of an agreement listed in section 12 to which the order relates, but the order is not invalid only because it is not served.</p><p class="sub">(6) 
						A reduction in an allowable annual cut under subsection (2) does not constitute a determination of an allowable annual cut for the purposes of the time limits set out in section 8 (1) and (2).</p><p class="sub">(7) 
						Section 8 (8) does not apply to a reduction of an allowable annual cut under this section.</p></div></div><div class="pit"><p class="reference"><a name="pit1384">
