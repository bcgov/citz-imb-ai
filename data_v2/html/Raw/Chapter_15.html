and Nisg̱a'a Village Governments does not create or imply any funding or financial obligation for Canada, British Columbia, the Nisg̱a'a Nation, or a Nisg̱a'a Village.</p><p class="schIndent1"><strong>6.</strong> Nisg̱a'a citizens are eligible to participate in programs established by Canada or British Columbia and to receive public services from Canada or British

public services under a fiscal financing agreement.</p><p class="schIndent1"><strong>7.</strong> The Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreements in respect of grants, between them, <em>in lieu</em> of property taxes.</p><p class="schIndent1"><strong>8.</strong> The funding for the Nisg̱a'a Nation and Nisg̱a'a Villages is a shared responsibility of the Parties and it is the shared
