            You may be required to file
            <strong> financial information </strong>
            (Form F8) if there is a claim by you or against you for support of a
            child or spouse. See the note at the end of Schedule 2 of the notice
            of family claim for details.

            If you do not file the financial information that is required, the

            award against you, based on that amount.
