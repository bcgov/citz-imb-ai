            The appeal of a termination of membership in a housing cooperative
            is governed by the
            <em> Cooperative Association Act </em>
            and Rule 18-3 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules. If you wish to
            appeal the decision to terminate your membership in the housing
            cooperative, you must first file a Notice of Appeal (Form 59,
            attached) in a Supreme Court registry within 30 days after the day
            you receive this Notice. (If you do not know where nearest the court
            registry is, consult the provincial government listings in the
            telephone directory.)

            The Notice of Appeal is a notice to the housing cooperative that you
            are appealing its decision to terminate your membership and that a
            hearing has been scheduled with a judge to determine how the appeal
            should proceed. This hearing is
            <strong> not </strong>
            the appeal itself; it is an initial application to a judge for
            directions as to how the appeal should proceed. (The judge may give
            any direction he or she considers necessary for the proper hearing
            and determination of the appeal. The judge may, for example, order
            that certain documents be produced at the appeal or set time limits
            within which you and/or the housing cooperative must take certain
            steps.)

            After completing the Notice of Appeal, except for the section that
            sets out the place and time of the hearing, the Notice of Appeal is
            ready to be filed at the court registry. On payment of a filing fee

            , a date for the hearing will be set by the court registry when you
            present the Notice of Appeal for filing.

            Within 14 days after the date on which you file your Notice of
            Appeal, you must inform the housing cooperative of your appeal and
            the date scheduled for a hearing by serving a copy of the Notice of
            Appeal on the housing cooperative. (The Notice of Appeal may be
            served on the housing cooperative by leaving it at its registered
            office; sending it by registered mail to the registered office of
            the housing cooperative; personally serving it on the directors or
            officers; or serving it in any manner listed in Rule 4-3 of the
            Supreme Court Civil Rules.)

            You are advised to serve the Notice of Appeal on the housing
            cooperative immediately after it has been filed. (The Supreme Court
            Civil Rules require that there must be at least 7 days between the
            time the cooperative is served with a Notice of Appeal and the day
            of the hearing.)

            After the initial hearing at which the judge issues directions as to
            how the appeal is to proceed, you must obtain a date from the court
            registrar for the hearing of the appeal. This is best accomplished
            in consultation with the housing cooperative to ensure that one of
            its representatives will be available to attend the hearing.

          <td>
            After the registrar gives you a date for the hearing of the appeal,
            you must file with the registrar a Notice of Hearing of Appeal (Form
            59B, attached) and serve a copy of it on the housing cooperative.
            (The Notice of Hearing of Appeal may be served in the same manner as
            the Notice of Appeal.) The appeal of your termination of membership
            will be heard by a judge at the time and place set out in the Notice
            of Hearing of Appeal, and you will have an opportunity to present
            your appeal in accordance with any directions that were issued by
            the judge at the initial hearing for directions.

            If after you've filed or served the Notice of Hearing of Appeal you
            decide not to proceed with the appeal, you must file a Notice of
            Abandonment of Appeal (Form 59C, attached) at the court registry and
            serve a copy of the Notice on the housing cooperative. Failure to
            properly notify the court registry and the housing cooperative may
            result in your having to pay the costs of an application to the
            court by the housing cooperative to dismiss the appeal and any other
            costs the court awards against you.
