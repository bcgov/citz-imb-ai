            The housing cooperative is required to pay the fee for filing the
            Notice of Appeal if you are not in arrears for any monthly housing
            charge. If there is a dispute about the amount of the monthly
            housing charge the housing cooperative is still required to pay the
            filing fee provided that you are not in arrears for the amount of
            the monthly housing charge that is
            <u> not </u>
            in dispute.
            <br />
            You must make your request to the housing cooperative in writing
            within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Right to Appeal. If the
            housing cooperative pays the filing fee and you are not successful
            in your appeal, the housing cooperative is entitled to recover the
            amount of the filing fee from you.
            <br />
            If you are not eligible to require the housing cooperative to pay
            the filing fee, you may wish to contact the Legal Services Society
            for information about applying for legal aid or a court registry for
            details as to how to apply for indigent status. Since appeals must
            be commenced within 30 days after the date you received this Notice,
            you are advised to investigate the various options for payment of
            the filing fee as soon as possible.
