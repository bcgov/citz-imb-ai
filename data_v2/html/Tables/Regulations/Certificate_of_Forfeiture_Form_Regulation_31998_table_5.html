            I hereby certify that on ....................................... I
            gave notice under s. 13 of the
            <em> Mineral Land Tax Act </em>
            , that unless the delinquent mineral land taxes, interest and
            penalties were fully paid within 90 days from the date the notice
            was published in the Gazette, the minerals and the right to work,
            win or carry away the minerals located in, under or on the mineral
            land (described above), would be absolutely forfeited to the Crown
            in the right of the Province of British Columbia. As the delinquent
            mineral land taxes, interest and penalties were not fully paid
            within the 90 day period, and are still not fully paid, the minerals
            and the right to work, win and carry away the minerals located in,
            under or on the mineral land are absolutely forfeited to and vested
            in the Crown in the right of the Province of British Columbia free
            and clear of all encumbrances.
