            <strong> Note to Claimant AND Respondent: </strong>
            You may be required to file
            <strong> financial information </strong>
            (Form F8) if there is a claim by you or against you for support of a
            child or spouse. See the note at the end of Schedules 1 and 2 of the
            counterclaim for details.
            <br />
            If you do not file the financial information that is required, the
            court may attribute an amount of income to you and make a support
            award against you, based on that amount.
