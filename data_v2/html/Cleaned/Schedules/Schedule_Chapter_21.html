      <p class="schIndent1">
        30. An applicant or a Party may apply to the Supreme Court of British
        Columbia to review a decision of the enrolment appeal board on the
        grounds that the enrolment appeal board:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. acted without jurisdiction, acted beyond its jurisdiction or refused
        to exercise its jurisdiction;

      <p class="schIndent2">c. erred in law; or</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a
        perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before
        it.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        31. On an application for judicial review under clause 30, the court may

        back to the enrolment appeal board for determination in accordance with
        any directions that the court considers appropriate.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        32. If the enrolment appeal board fails to hear or decide an appeal
        within a reasonable time, an applicant or Party may apply to the Supreme
        Court of British Columbia for an order directing the enrolment appeal
        board to hear or decide the appeal, in accordance with any directions
        that the court considers appropriate.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        33. An applicant or Party may apply for judicial review within 60 days
        of receiving notification of the decision of the enrolment appeal board
