                  A Dam Safety Review involves collection of all available dam
                  records, field inspections, detailed investigations and
                  possibly laboratory testing. It then proceeds with a check of
                  structural stability and operational safety of the dam,
                  beginning with a reappraisal of basic features and
                  assumptions. The level of detail required in a Dam Safety
                  Review should be commensurate with the importance and
                  complexity of the dam, as well as the consequences of failure.
