              case of cash settled derivative instruments, factors in addition
              to the creditworthiness of the issuer, such as the continued
              subsistence of the underlying interest or the volatility of the
              price, value or level of the underlying interest may be reflected
              in the rating analysis. Rather than being addressed in the rating
              itself, these factors may be described by an approved rating
              organization by way of a superscript or other notation to a
              rating. Any such attributes must be discussed in the disclosure

              of a superscript or other notation to a rating. Any such

              3. While compensation practices vary, there are generally two
              approaches that boards of directors use when setting compensation.
              A board of directors may decide the value in securities of the
              company it intends to award or pay as compensation. Alternatively,
              a board of directors may decide the portion of the potential
              ownership of the company it intends to transfer as compensation. A
              fair value ascribed to the award will normally result from these
              approaches.

              A company may calculate this value either in accordance with a
              valuation methodology identified in Section 3870 of the Handbook
              or in accordance with another methodology set out in comment 5

              4. In some cases, the grant date fair value disclosed in columns
              (d) and (e) may differ from the accounting fair value. For
              financial statement purposes, the accounting fair value amount is
              amortized over the service period to obtain an accounting cost
              (accounting compensation expense), adjusted at year end as
              required.

              5. While the most commonly used methodologies for calculating the
              value of most types of awards are the Black-Scholes-Merton model
              and the binomial lattice model, companies may choose to use
              another valuation methodology if it produces a more meaningful and
              reasonable estimate of fair value.

              even if the accounting compensation expense is zero. The amount
              disclosed in the table should reflect the grant date fair value
              following the principles described under comments 2 and 3, above.
