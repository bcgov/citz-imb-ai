            Despite section 1, if a requirement made by a licence holder under
            section&nbsp;1 results in a substantial change in the timber
            harvesting services provided by the contractor, the contractor may,
            within 30 days of receiving notice of the requirement, and by
            written notice to the licence holder, terminate the contract without
            liability to the licence holder.

            either party may, within 90&nbsp;days of the contractor receiving
            notice under section&nbsp;1, request a review of the rate then in
