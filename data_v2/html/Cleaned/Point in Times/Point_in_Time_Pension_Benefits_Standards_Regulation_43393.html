              but for this subsection, falls within a class of employees
              described in subsection&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(g), (h) or&nbsp;(i), is
              exempt from section&nbsp;25 of the Act and that employee must be
              treated for the purposes of the Act and this regulation as not
              falling within that class of employees.

            If the person has a spouse the commutation can only proceed if the
            spouse has consented to the commutation by completing in the
            prescribed manner a spouse's waiver of entitlements using
            Form&nbsp;2. The completed Form&nbsp;2 must be attached to this
            form, and has the effect of waiving spousal entitlements only in
            respect of the benefit entitlements in plans and funds listed on
            this form. The completed Form&nbsp;2 does not operate to waive
            spousal entitlements to benefit entitlements in any other plans or
            funds the declarant may have.

            This form must be completed if a member or former member of a
            pension plan regulated by the
            <em> Pension Benefits Standards Act </em>
            and/or the owner of a locked-in RRSP or life income fund ("LIF")
            regulated by the Pension Benefits Standards Regulation has ceased to
            be a resident of Canada and wishes to transfer benefit entitlements
            out of Canada. In order to transfer benefit entitlements out of
            Canada the person must have been absent from Canada for more than
            2&nbsp;years, and the person must have been determined by the Canada
            Customs and Revenue Agency to be a non-resident of Canada for the
            purposes of the
            <em> Income Tax Act </em>
            (Canada). A copy of that determination must be attached to this
            form.

            If the person has a spouse the transfer can only proceed if the
            spouse has consented to the transfer by completing in the prescribed
            manner a spouse's waiver of entitlements using Form&nbsp;2. The
            completed Form&nbsp;2 must be attached to this form, and has the
            effect of waiving spousal entitlements only in respect of benefit
            entitlements in the plans and funds listed on this form. The
            completed Form&nbsp;2 does not operate to waive spousal entitlements
            to benefit entitlements in any other plans or funds the declarant
            may have.
