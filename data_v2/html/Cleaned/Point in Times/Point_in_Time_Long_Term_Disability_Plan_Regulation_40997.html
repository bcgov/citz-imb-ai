            An employee in receipt of Long Term Disability benefits will be
            considered an employee for purposes of superannuation and will
            continue to be covered by the group life, extended health, dental
            and medical plans established under an enactment. Employees will not
            be covered by any other provision of a collective agreement or term
            and condition of employment but will retain the right of access to a
            Rehabilitation Committee established thereunder and will retain
            seniority rights should they return to employment within nine (9)
            months following cessation of benefits. A temporary assignment or
            auxiliary appointment will not disqualify an employee from the 9
            month access period.
