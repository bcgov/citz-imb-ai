              In determining all questions relating to compensation, the
              Attorney General must be guided by the principle that as the
              survey was undertaken for the benefit of all registered owners
              within the special survey area, such registered owners should in
              proportion to the area of their respective parcels share any loss
              and any advantage occasioned by and accruing from the special
              survey, and that if for the general benefit or for the
              preservation of individual improvements the surveyor has reduced
              the area of any parcel, the registered owner should receive
              compensation from the registered owner benefited or from a general
              fund formed by payments from the registered owners benefited, as
