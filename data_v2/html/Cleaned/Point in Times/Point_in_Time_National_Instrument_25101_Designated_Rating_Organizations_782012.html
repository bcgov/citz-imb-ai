            (b) the level of assessment the designated rating organization has
            performed concerning the due diligence processes carried out at the
            level of underlying financial instruments or other assets of

            assessment and how the outcome of such assessment impacts the credit
            rating.

            4.7 A designated rating organization will disclose on an ongoing
            basis information about all securitized products submitted to it for
            its initial review or for a preliminary rating, including whether
            the issuer requested the designated rating organization to provide a
            final rating.

            4.9 The designated rating organization will differentiate ratings of
            securitized products from traditional corporate bond ratings through
            a different rating symbology. The designated rating organization
            will also disclose how this differentiation functions. The
            designated rating organization will clearly define a given rating
            symbol and apply it in a consistent manner for all types of
            securities to which that symbol is assigned.
