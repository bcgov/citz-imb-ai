            C. RCDC, H37P and BC&nbsp;Hydro have determined that, as an
            alternative to RCDC taking electrical service for the Red Chris Mine
            at BQN, H37P should develop the 287kV Line, BC&nbsp;Hydro should
            acquire the 287kV Line from H37P, and RCDC should take electrical
            service for the Red Chris Mine at TAT, or on an interim basis via
            the Tap, as that is expected to permit RCDC to meet its expected Red
            Chris Mine ISD, would provide a better means of providing electrical
            service to the Red Chris Mine, and would facilitate the supply of
            electricity by BC&nbsp;Hydro to and the receipt of electricity by
            BC&nbsp;Hydro from other existing and future communities and
            developments in the region, all on the terms and conditions set out

            reasonably that it will not require electrical service for the Red
            Chris Mine to begin commercial operation on the then current Red

            On the Closing Date, if all documents and funds have been delivered
            as provided in Sections 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5, all documents and funds
            will be held in escrow with the exception of any registrable
            transfer(s) of Real Properties, which shall be tendered for
            registration in the appropriate Land Title Office. Upon acceptance
            for registration thereof and receipt by BC&nbsp;Hydro of a
            post-filing index search indicating that in the normal course of
            Land Title Office routine, title to such Real Properties will be
            issued in the name of BC&nbsp;Hydro subject only to the Permitted
            Encumbrances, the escrow shall terminate and the balance of H37P's
            and RCDC's closing deliveries shall be released to BC&nbsp;Hydro and
            BC&nbsp;Hydro's closing deliveries shall be released to H37P and

            With respect to interests in Assumed Contracts and Permits that form
            part of the Purchased Assets for which Consents are not received on
            or before Closing (collectively, the "Unassigned Interests"), the
            transfer and assignment of the Unassigned Interests will not be
            effective in each case until the applicable Consent has been
            received, and such Unassigned Interests will be held by H37P
            following the Closing in trust (to the extent permitted by
            Applicable Laws) for the benefit and exclusive use of BC&nbsp;Hydro.
            H37P shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
            obtain the applicable Consents and until such time as they are
            received, H37P shall only make use of any Unassigned Interests in
            accordance with the lawful directions of BC&nbsp;Hydro that do not
            conflict with the terms of such Unassigned Interests. BC&nbsp;Hydro
            will reimburse H37P for all out-of-pocket liabilities, costs and
            expenses incurred by H37P from and after the Closing Date at the
            direction of BC&nbsp;Hydro and arising out of H37P's performance of
            its obligations under this Section 6.7.
