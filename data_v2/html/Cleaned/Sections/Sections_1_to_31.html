        <p>
          WHEREAS the recognition and reconciliation of the prior presence of
          Aboriginal peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of
          significant social and economic importance to all British Columbians;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is
          best achieved through negotiation and agreement, rather than through
          litigation;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS, in order to achieve this reconciliation, representatives
          of the Maa-nulth First Nations, Canada and British Columbia have
          negotiated the Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement in a process
          facilitated by the British Columbia Treaty Commission;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS British Columbia is building a New Relationship with First
          Nations and working to close the social and economic gaps that exist
          between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement embodies the
          principles of this New Relationship, including mutual respect,
          recognition and reconciliation of Aboriginal rights and title;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement requires that
          British Columbia enact legislation to give effect to the Maa-nulth
          First Nations Final Agreement;
        </p>
