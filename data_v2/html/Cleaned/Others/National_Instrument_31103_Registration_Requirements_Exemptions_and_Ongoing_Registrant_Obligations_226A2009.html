            managing their funds. The managers pay us ongoing trailing
            commissions for the services and advice we provide you. The amount

            chose when you purchased the fund. You are not directly charged the

        <strong> Line 5. Related-party debt </strong>
        — Refer to the CICA Handbook for the definition of "related party" for
        publicly accountable enterprises. The firm is required to deliver a copy
        of the executed subordination agreement to the regulator or, in Québec,
        the securities regulatory authority on the earlier of (a) 10 days after
        the date the agreement is executed or (b) the date an amount
        subordinated by the agreement is excluded from its calculation of excess
        working capital on Form 31-103F1
        <em> Calculation of Excess Working Capital </em>
        .
        <strong>
          The firm must notify the regulator or, in Québec, the securities
          regulatory authority, 10 days before it repays the loan (in whole or
          in part), or terminates the subordination agreement.

        <em> Calculation of Excess Working Capital </em>
        . A schedule supporting the calculation of any amounts included in Line

        — If the registered firm is guaranteeing the liability of another party,
        the total amount of the guarantee must be included in the capital
        calculation. If the amount of a guarantee is included in the firm's
        statement of financial position as a current liability and is reflected
        in Line 4, do not include the amount of the guarantee on Line 11.

        (ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the registrant's
        investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the
        fair value of the investments (securities) that are short.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the amount
        to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the shortfall
        in cash.
