        For the administration of securities legislation or derivatives

        regulator or, in Québec, the securities regulatory authority may require
        access to the business location to review the books, records and

        require access to the business location for the administration of the

        If the business location specified in this form is a residence, the

        enter the residence.

      <p align="left">
        If consent is not provided, it may affect the ability of the regulator,
        securities regulatory authority or SRO to access the books, records or
        documents of a registered firm and to determine whether securities
        legislation, derivatives legislation (including commodity futures
        legislation) or the rules of the SRO are being complied with. As a
        result, the regulator, securities regulatory authority or SRO may take
        action if it is unable to access and review the books, records or

        Your personal information is collected by, or on behalf of, each
        securities regulatory authority and SRO set out in Schedule A. Any of

      <p class="schIndent2">
        This personal information is being collected under the authority of the
        applicable securities legislation, derivatives legislation (including
        commodity futures legislation) or both of the securities regulatory
        authorities and under the SRO rules of an SRO set out in Schedule A. The
        collection, use and disclosure are done in accordance with applicable
        freedom of information and privacy legislation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The principal purpose of this collection by the securities regulatory
        authorities is to administer, enforce, carry out their duties or
        exercise their powers under their respective securities legislation,
        derivatives legislation (including commodity futures legislation) or
        both, and by the SROs to administer and enforce the rules of the SROs.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        If you have any questions about the collection, use and disclosure of

        any jurisdiction in which the required information is submitted. See
        Schedule A for details.

        <strong> Line 5. Related-party Debt </strong>
        — Refer to the CPA Canada Handbook for the definition of "related party"
        for publicly accountable enterprises. The firm is required to deliver a
        copy of the executed subordination agreement to the regulator or, in
        Québec, the securities regulatory authority on the earlier of (a) 10
        days after the date the agreement is executed or (b) the date an amount

        — If the registered firm is guaranteeing the liability of another party,
        the total amount of the guarantee must be included in the capital
        calculation. If the amount of a guarantee is included in the firm's
        statement of financial position as a current liability and is reflected

        for those securities.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        (ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the registrant's

        fair value of the investments (securities) that are short.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the amount
        to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the shortfall
        in cash.
