          as of a date not more than seven days before the date of the
          prospectus, the issuer expects that in each local jurisdiction in
          which the prospectus will be filed the number of securities of each
          class of equity securities held by registered holders whose last
          address as shown on the books of the issuer is in the local
          jurisdiction, or beneficially owned by persons or companies in the
          local jurisdiction, will be less than 2% of the outstanding number of
          securities of the class after giving effect to the proposed
          distribution.

        <em> General Prospectus Requirements </em>

        The regulators collect the personal information in the Personal

        administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities
        legislation, including those provisions that require or permit the
        regulators to refuse to issue a receipt for a prospectus if it appears
        to the regulators that the past conduct of management or promoters of
        the Issuer affords reasonable grounds for belief that the business of
        the Issuer will not be conducted with integrity and in the best
        interests of its securityholders.

      <p align="left">
        You understand that by signing the certificate and consent in the
        Personal Information Form, you are consenting to the Issuer submitting
        your personal information in the Personal Information Form (the
        "Information") to the regulators and to the collection and use by the
        regulators of the Information, as well as any other information that may
        be necessary to administer and enforce provincial and territorial
        securities legislation. This may include the collection of information
        from law enforcement agencies, other government or non-governmental
        regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations, exchanges, and
        quotation and trade reporting systems in order to conduct background
        checks, verify the Information and perform investigations and conduct
        enforcement proceedings as required to ensure compliance with provincial
        and territorial securities legislation. Your consent also extends to the
        collection, use and disclosure of the Information as described above in
        respect of other prospectus filings of the Issuer and the prospectus
        filings of any other issuer in a situation where you are or will be:

      <p align="left">
        You understand that the Issuer is required to deliver the Information to
        the regulators because the Issuer has filed a prospectus under
        provincial and territorial securities legislation. You also understand
        that you have a right to be informed of the existence of personal
        information about you that is kept by regulators, that you have the
        right to request access to that information, and that you have the right
        to request that such information be corrected, subject to the applicable
        provisions of the freedom of information and protection of privacy
        legislation adopted by each province and territory.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        You also understand and agree that the Information the regulators
        collect about you may also be disclosed, as permitted by law, where its
        use and disclosure is for the purposes described above. The regulators
        may also use a third party to process the Information, but when this
        happens, the third party will be carefully selected and obligated to
        comply with the limited use restrictions described above and with
        provincial and federal privacy legislation.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        <em>
          (1) The objective of the prospectus is to provide information
          concerning the issuer that an investor needs in order to make an
          informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific disclosure
          requirements that are in addition to the general requirement under
          securities legislation to provide full, true and plain disclosure of
          all material facts relating to the securities to be distributed.
          Certain rules of specific application impose prospectus disclosure
          obligations in addition to those described in this Form.

        <em>
          (2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or
          interpreted in the Instrument bear that definition or interpretation.

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <em>
          (3) In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of
          materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgment in
          the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an
          item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of the
          information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is
          considered material if it is probable that its omission or
          misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with
          respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information
          is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative
          factors. The potential significance of items must be considered
          individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an
          offsetting effect.

          (4) Unless an item specifically requires disclosure only in the
          preliminary prospectus, the disclosure requirements set out in this
          Form apply to both the preliminary prospectus and the prospectus.
          Details concerning the price and other matters dependent upon or
          relating to price, such as the number of securities being distributed,
          may be left out of the preliminary prospectus, along with specifics
          concerning the plan of distribution, to the extent that these matters

          with the plain language principles listed in section 4.1 of Companion
          Policy 41-101CP General Prospectus Requirements. If technical terms
          are required, clear and concise explanations should be included.

          companies that the issuer is required, under the issuer's GAAP, to
          consolidate, proportionately consolidate or account for using the
          equity method (for example, including "subsidiaries" as that term is

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <em>
          (1) The objective of the prospectus is to provide information
          concerning the investment fund that an investor needs in order to make
          an informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific
          disclosure requirements that are in addition to the general
          requirement under securities legislation to provide full, true and
          plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities to
          be distributed. This Form does not prohibit including information
          beyond what the Form requires. Further, certain rules of specific
          application impose prospectus disclosure obligations in addition to
          those described in this Form.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <em>
          (2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or
          interpreted in the Instrument must bear that definition or
          interpretation. Other definitions are set out in NI 14-101
          Definitions.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <em>
          (3) In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of
          materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgment in
          the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an
          item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of the
          information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is
          considered material if it is probable that its omission or
          misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with
          respect to the investment fund's securities. In determining whether
          information is material, take into account both quantitative and
          qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be
          considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have
          an offsetting effect.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        <em>
          (4) Unless an item specifically requires disclosure only in the
          preliminary prospectus, the disclosure requirements set out in this
          Form apply to both the preliminary prospectus and the prospectus.
          Details concerning the price and other matters dependent upon or
          relating to price, such as the number of securities being distributed,
          may be left out of the preliminary prospectus, along with specifics
          concerning the plan of distribution, to the extent that these matters
          have not been decided.

          (5) The disclosure must be understandable to readers and presented in

          with the plain language principles listed in section 4.1 of Companion
          Policy 41-101CP General Prospectus Requirements. If technical terms
          are required, clear and concise explanations should be included.

          sub-headings under the required headings.

          investment fund's investees. If it is more likely than not that a
          person or company will become an investee, it may be necessary to also
          include disclosure with respect to the person or company. For this
          purpose, investees include entities that are consolidated,
          proportionately consolidated, or accounted for using the equity

          unless otherwise specified by the requirements of this Form.

          a separate investment fund for the purposes of this Form, or may
          combine disclosure of one or more of the classes or series in one

          securities referable to separate portfolios may combine disclosure of
          one or more of the classes or series in one prospectus if each class

      <p class="schIndent2">
        The [insert name of plan] is a [insert type of plan] scholarship plan
        designed to help you save for a child's post-secondary education. When
        you open your [insert name of plan], we will apply to the Canada Revenue
        Agency to register the plan as a Registered Education Savings Plan
        (RESP). This allows your savings to grow tax-free until the child named
        as the beneficiary of the plan enrols in their studies. The Government
        of Canada and some provincial governments offer government grants to
        help you save even more. To register your plan as an RESP, we need
        social insurance numbers for yourself and the child you name in the plan
        as the beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        In a [insert type of plan] scholarship plan, you are part of a group of
        investors. Everyone's contributions are invested together. When the plan
        matures, each child in the group shares in the earnings on that money.
        Your share of those earnings plus your government grant money is paid to
        your child as educational assistance payments (EAPs).
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        There are two main exceptions. Your child will not receive EAPs, and you

        You have until the maturity date to make changes to your plan. This
        includes switching the plan to a different child, changing the maturity

          $x.xx per unit), in addition to stating the fixed amount of sales

          the column titled "What you pay" must also be expressed as a
          percentage of the cost of a unit of the scholarship plan. If the total
          cost of a unit of the scholarship plan varies depending on the
          contribution option or frequency selected, the percentage sales charge
          must be expressed as a range, between the lowest and the highest
          percentage of the unit cost the sales charge can represent, based on
          the different contribution options available to subscribers under the

          sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the highest
          total cost per unit, and (ii) divide the sales charge per unit by the
          contribution option that has the lowest total cost per unit. For
          example, if a scholarship plan calculates its sales charge as
          $200/unit, and the total cost per unit for a subscriber can range from
          $1 000 to $5 000 (based on the different options available to
          subscribers), the percentage range of the sales charge disclosed in
          the table would be 4% (200/5000) to 20% (200/1000). The disclosure in
          the table must also state that the exact percentage of the sales
          charge per unit for a subscriber will depend on the contribution
          option selected for contributing to the scholarship plan and how old
          their beneficiary is at the time they open the scholarship plan.

        A scholarship plan is a type of investment fund that is designed to help

        You sign a contract when you open a plan with us. You make contributions

        applicable fees. You will get back your contributions, less fees,
        whether or not your beneficiary goes on to post-secondary education.

          (1) in the column titled "What you pay" must also be expressed as a
          percentage of the cost of a unit of the scholarship plan. If the total

        (2) Under the sub-sub-heading "Payments from the EAP account", provide
        information in the form of the following table about the funding of the
        EAP account. Introduce the table using the following wording or wording
        that is substantially similar with the title of the table "Past
        breakdown of income in the EAP account" in bold type:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        A portion of each EAP consists of a beneficiary's share of the EAP
        account. The rest of an EAP is made up of the beneficiary's government
        grants and the earnings on those government grants.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The EAP account holds the income earned on contributions made by
        subscribers. This includes the income earned on contributions of
        subscribers who have cancelled their plan or whose plan was cancelled by
        us. There is a separate EAP account for each beneficiary group.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        <strong> Past breakdown of income in the EAP account </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The table below shows the breakdown of income in the EAP account at the
        maturity date for the five beneficiary groups that most recently reached
        their year of eligibility.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The breakdown of income can vary by beneficiary group. The amount of
        income earned on contributions depends on the performance of the plan's
        investments. The amount of income from cancelled plans depends on how
        many plans were cancelled, as well as the investment performance of that
        money.

        <strong> Item 6 â€” Trading ETFs </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Under the sub-heading "Trading ETFs", state the following:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        ETFs hold a basket of investments, like mutual funds, but trade on
        exchanges like stocks. Here are a few things to keep in mind when
        trading ETFs:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Pricing [in bold type]</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        ETFs have two sets of prices: market price and net asset value (NAV).
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Market price</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        ETFs are bought and sold on exchanges at the market price. The market
        price can change throughout the trading day. Factors like supply,
        demand, and changes in the value of an ETF's investments can affect the
        market price.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        You can get price quotes any time during the trading day. Quotes have
        two parts: bid and ask.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay if you want to
        sell your ETF [units/shares]. The ask is the lowest price a seller is
        willing to accept if you want to buy ETF [units/shares]. The difference
        between the two is called the "bid-ask spread".
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        In general, a smaller bid-ask spread means the ETF is more liquid. That
        means you are more likely to get the price you expect.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Net asset value (NAV)</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Like mutual funds, ETFs have a NAV. It is calculated after the close of
        each trading day and reflects the value of an ETF's investments at that
        point in time.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        NAV is used to calculate financial information for reporting purposes â€”
        like the returns shown in this document.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Orders [in bold type]</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        There are two main options for placing trades: market orders and limit
        orders. A market order lets you buy or sell [units/shares] at the
        current market price. A limit order lets you set the price at which you
        are willing to buy or sell [units/shares].
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Timing [in bold type]</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        In general, market prices of ETFs can be more volatile around the start
        and end of the trading day. Consider using a limit order or placing a
        trade at another time during the trading day.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        In general, you'll have to pay income tax on any money you make on an

        or not you hold the ETF in a registered plan such as a Registered
        Retirement Savings Plan, or a Tax-Free Savings Account.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Keep in mind that if you hold your ETF in a non-registered account,
        distributions from the ETF are included in your taxable income, whether
