        work. If Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, and the Grantor cannot
        agree on a work plan requested by Hydro or TELUS within 30 days of
        receipt by the Grantor of the proposed work plan, then either party may

        D. if Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, determines in its reasonable
        judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are imminent safety
        concerns, Hydro and TELUS may, without approval of the Grantor,
        undertake works and take such steps on the Lands as are reasonably
        required to be taken immediately in order to protect the Works, or to
        protect persons or property that may be at risk from the Works, and in

        Foreshore for the purpose of constructing, using and maintaining a
        floating residential home for non-commercial use on the portion of the

        through them, in accordance with the Licence (collectively, the "Float

        Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes
        authorized and approved in the Licence, provided however that this
        Consent does not extend so far as to permit British Columbia to
        authorize the Float Home Area Users to alter or enlarge any Improvements
        existing on the Float Home Area on •, or to construct, erect, place,
        install or moor new Improvements on the Float Home Area after •, if such

      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. British Columbia covenants and agrees with Tla'amin that nothing in

        British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants,
        invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, to enter onto
        the Upland or to construct, place, erect or install any buildings,
        structures, improvements or works thereon.

        DESCRIPTION] (the "Upland"); [Note: Insert Legal Description for area
        immediately adjacent to foreshore. If Upland is not in LTO then describe
        land as accurately as possible];
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        A. British Columbia is the owner in fee simple of the parcel or tract of
        land being the foreshore fronting on the Upland and all land covered by
        water adjoining the Upland (the "Foreshore");
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        B. The Upland and Foreshore are adjacent to each other and Tla'amin, as
        owner of the Upland, is entitled to exercise its riparian right of
        access to the Upland by crossing the Foreshore;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        C. British Columbia wishes to interfere with Tla'amin's riparian right
        of access to the Upland by authorizing, under an existing licence of
        occupation (the "Licence"), the use of the identified portions of the
        Foreshore for marine invertebrates aquaculture purposes on the portion
        of the Foreshore shown outlined in bold on the attached Schedule "A"
        ("Aquaculture Area") pursuant to a licence dated for reference • and
        numbered •, which has a term expiring •; and
      </p>

        D. Tla'amin is prepared to consent to such interference pursuant to the
        provisions set out below.

        NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of
        ONE ($1.00) dollar and other good and valuable consideration, now paid
        by British Columbia to Tla'amin (the receipt and sufficiency of which is
        hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. Tla'amin, as owner of the Upland, on the terms set forth herein,
        hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its
        servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees
        and all those claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the
        Licence, with Tla'amin's right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and
        repass over the Aquaculture Area to gain access to and from the Upland.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. Tla'amin acknowledges and agrees that the Consent hereby given
        entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents,
        contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming
        through them, in accordance with the Licence (collectively, the
        "Aquaculture Area Users") to:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a) construct, erect, place, install, moor, maintain, replace, renovate
        and repair buildings, structures, works, improvements and chattels
        (collectively, the "Improvements") on all or any part of the Aquaculture
        Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes
        authorized and approved in the Licence, provided however that this
        Consent does not extend so far as to permit British Columbia to
        authorize the Aquaculture Area Users to alter or enlarge any
        Improvements existing on the Aquaculture Area on •, or to construct,
        erect, place, install or moor new Improvements on the Aquaculture Area
        after •, if such alteration, enlargement, construction, erection,
        placement, installation or mooring would materially interfere with
        reasonable access to the Upland; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b) do all other acts within the Aquaculture Area, reasonably necessary
        or incidental to the purposes authorized and approved in connection with
        the Licence.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. Tla'amin or any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be,
        will give written notice of this Consent to any person to whom it
        proposes to dispose of any portion of the Upland which borders on the
        Foreshore, which notice will be received by that person prior to such
        disposition. Prior to or concurrently with such disposition, Tla'amin or
        any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be, will obtain a
        written ratification of this Consent by the transferee of such portion
        of the Upland in the same form as this Consent and will deliver an
        originally executed copy thereof to British Columbia. For the purposes
        of this paragraph, the word "dispose" means any transfer by any method
        to any person entitled to exercise a riparian right of access to the
        Upland.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. British Columbia covenants and agrees with Tla'amin that nothing in
        this Consent will be deemed or otherwise construed so as to permit
        British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants,
        invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, to enter onto
        the Upland or to construct, place, erect or install any buildings,
        structures, improvements or works thereon.

        the Grantee will, within 60 days of receiving the request, obtain the
        required additional insurance and deliver to the Owner written

        <strong> Security </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The Grantee will deliver the Security to the Owner within 30 days of the
        commencement of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Grantee's
        use of the Easement Area, as security for the performance of the

        use the Security to reimburse the Owner for all reasonable costs and
        expenses, including legal and other professional services costs if any,
        caused by or arising out of the Grantee's breach, and in the event of a
        call on the Security of the Grantee will, as a condition of the
        continuation of this Agreement, immediately pay to the Owner the amount
        of the draw so that the full amount of the Security is available.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The parties agree that the amount of the Security does not constitute a
        liquidated damages estimate of the Owner's damages if the Grantee
        breaches its obligations hereunder and the Owner reserves its right to
        claim for further damages.

        the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction;

        21.
        <strong> Interpretation </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">In this Agreement:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) all attached schedules form an integral part of this Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the
        plural and the masculine includes the feminine gender, body politic and
        a corporation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (c) the headings are for convenience only and are not to be construed as
        defining or in any way limiting the scope or intent of the Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (d) a reference to an enactment of British Columbia or of Canada will be
        deemed to include a reference to any subsequent amendments or
        replacements; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (e) if any provision is determined by a court or arbitrator of competent
        jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be
        considered separate and severable, and the legality or enforceability of
        the remaining provisions will not be affected by that determination.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        22. Each party will, upon the request of the other, do or cause to be
        done all lawful acts necessary for the performance of the provisions of
        this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        23. Wherever this Agreement provides that an action may be taken, a
        consent or approval must be obtained or a determination must be made,
        then the Owner or the Grantee, as the case may be, will act reasonably
        in taking such action, deciding whether to provide such consent or
        approval or making such determination; but where this Agreement states
        that the Owner or the Grantee have sole discretion to take an action,
        provide a consent or approval or make a determination, there will be no
        requirement to show reasonableness or to act reasonably in taking that
        action, providing that consent or approval or making that determination.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        24. If, due to a strike, lockout, labour dispute, act of God, inability
        to obtain labour or materials, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order
        of a competent governmental authority, enemy or hostile action, civil
        commotion, fire or other casualty or any condition or case beyond the
        Grantee's reasonable control, other than normal weather conditions, the
        Grantee is delayed in performing any of its obligations under this
        Agreement, the time for the performance of that obligation will be
        extended by a period of time equal to the period of time of the delay so
        long as:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) the Grantee gives notice to the Owner within 30 days of the
        commencement of the delay setting forth the nature of the delay and an
        estimated time frame for the performance of its obligation; and
      </p>

        (b) the Grantee diligently attempts to remove the delay.

        affect the exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder. The question of
        whether a grant materially affects the exercise of the Licensee's rights
        hereunder shall be determined by the Owner acting reasonably. If the
