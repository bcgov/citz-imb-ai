          Where the boundaries of a parcel, as it appears on the roll, are
          altered so as to create a new parcel, and where real-property taxes on
          such first-mentioned parcel are unpaid, the Collector may apportion
          such taxes in the proportion that the value of the new parcel bears to
          the value of the old, and in arriving at such apportionment the
          Collector may accept the certified valuation of the assessor. Upon
          such apportionment, the sums so apportioned as taxes shall be deemed
          to be real-property taxes levied upon such new parcel.
