          If part of an examination of a person taken under Rule 7-5 is tendered
          in evidence, the court may review the whole of that examination and
          if, following the review, the court considers that another part of the
          examination is so closely connected with the part tendered in evidence
          that the last mentioned part ought not to be used without the other
          part, it may direct that the other part be tendered as evidence.
