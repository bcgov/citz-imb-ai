          <em> General </em>
          — Suitable for viewing by persons of all ages. Occasional violence,
          swearing and coarse language, and the most innocent of sexually
          suggestive scenes and nudity, are permitted in this category.

          — Parental guidance advised. Theme or content may not be suitable for
          all children although there is no age restriction. Motion pictures in
          this category may contain less subtle sexually suggestive scenes and
          nudity and a more realistic portrayal of violence than in the General
          category; coarse language may occur more often than in the General
          category.

          years of age must view these motion pictures accompanied by an adult.
          Motion pictures in this category may contain violence, coarse language

          accompanied by an adult. Motion pictures in this category will contain
          horror, explicit violence, frequent coarse language or scenes that are
          more sexually suggestive than in the 14A category, or any combination
          of them.

          — Restricted to persons 18 years of age and over. Persons under 18
          years of age are not permitted to attend under any circumstances.
          These motion pictures are "adult motion pictures", as defined in the
          Act, and may contain explicit sexual scenes, violence or scenes
          referred to in section 5 (3) of the Act, or any combination of them.
          The director will assign this classification to motion pictures if the
          director considers that the theme, subject matter or plot of the adult
          motion picture is artistic, historical, political, educational or
          scientific.

          years of age are not permitted to attend under any circumstances.
          These motion pictures are "adult motion pictures", as defined in the
          Act, and may contain explicit sexual scenes or scenes of brutality or
          torture to persons or animals, or any combination of them, that are
          portrayed in a realistic and explicit manner; however, the scenes
          would, in the director's opinion, be tolerable to the community.
