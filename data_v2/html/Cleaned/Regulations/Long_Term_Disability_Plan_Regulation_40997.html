          Where an employee/appointee has sick bank credits, basic pay will
          continue during the first part of the long term disability benefit
          period until the sick bank is exhausted. The employee/appointee will
          be considered to be on a seven hour day and a five/two shift pattern
          for purposes of calculating the sick bank usage. The
          employee/appointee is on Long Term Disability Benefits while utilizing
          the sick bank credits and is therefore governed by the Long Term
          Disability Plan provisions.

          Long Term Disability claims will be adjudicated and paid by a
          claims-paying agent to be appointed by the employer. In the event a

          arrange to have the claim reviewed by a Claims Review Committee

          claimant, one (1) by the employer, and a third agreed to by the first
