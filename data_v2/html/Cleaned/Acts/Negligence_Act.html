          If by the fault of 2 or more persons damage or loss is caused to one
          or more of them, the liability to make good the damage or loss is in
          proportion to the degree to which each person was at fault.

          Despite subsection (1), if, having regard to all the circumstances of
          the case, it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault,
          the liability must be apportioned equally.
