          For the purposes of imposing an increased administrative penalty for a
          second or subsequent contravention as prescribed within a 5 year
          period, the only question to be considered is the sequence of the
          orders imposing administrative penalties and no consideration may be
          given to the sequence of the contraventions or whether any
          contravention occurred before or after an order imposing an
          administrative penalty.
