          AND WHEREAS the Nisg̱a'a Final Agreement requires that British Columbia
          enact settlement legislation to give effect to the Nisg̱a'a Final
          Agreement;

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 1. </strong>
        Within a reasonable time after a Party provides the other Parties with a
        written proposal to clarify the location of a part of a boundary of
        Nisg̱a'a Lands, the Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement
        on whether, how, and at whose cost to undertake the proposed
        clarification of boundary location.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 2. </strong>
        Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the cost as between the Parties of
        any field survey undertaken to clarify the location of a part of a
        boundary of Nisg̱a'a Lands will be borne by:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the Party authorizing an activity causing the need for clarification
        of the boundary location; or

        b. the Party proposing clarification of the boundary location, if no
        Party has authorized an activity causing the need for clarification of
        the boundary location.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 3. </strong>
        If the Parties do not agree on whether, how, or at whose cost to
        undertake the proposed boundary clarification, any Party may refer the
        matter to be finally determined by arbitration under the Dispute
        Resolution Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 4. </strong>
        If the Parties agree to undertake the field survey of a part of a
        boundary of Nisg̱a'a Lands, or if an arbitrator orders the field survey
        of a part of a boundary of Nisg̱a'a Lands, the Parties will provide
        notice to the Surveyor General of British Columbia of the agreement of
        the Parties or the order of the arbitrator.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 5. </strong>
        Upon receiving notice under paragraph 4, the Surveyor General will
        prepare and submit to the Parties for approval provisional survey

        part of the boundary of Nisg̱a'a Lands.

        <strong> 6. </strong>
        After the Parties have approved the survey instructions for the part of

        approved survey instructions to the British Columbia Land Surveyor
        designated by the Party responsible for the costs of the survey or,
        where more than one Party is responsible, to the British Columbia Land
        Surveyor designated by those Parties. The Party or Parties responsible
        for the costs of the survey will be determined in accordance with
        paragraphs 2 and 3.

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the percentage for that species set out in Table 1, Row 1, multiplied

        chum salmon can be identified as resulting from Nisg̱a'a enhancement
        initiatives in the Nass Area approved under paragraph 34 of the
        Fisheries Chapter, that portion will be subtracted from the estimated
        number of Nass salmon of that species returning to Canadian waters in
        that year.

        salmon of that species returning to Canada exceeds the minimum
        escapement level but does not exceed the small return to Canada for that
        species set out in Table 1, Row 2, the Nisg̱a'a fish allocation will
        increase in a linear manner, from zero at the minimum escapement level
        to the threshold for that species set out in Table 1, Row 3, except that
        the Nisg̱a'a fish allocation will not exceed the return to Canada minus
        the minimum escapement level.

        <strong> 3. </strong>
        If the number of Nass salmon of a species returning to Canada exceeds
        the large return to Canada for that species set out in Table 1, Row 2,
        the Nisg̱a'a fish allocation will not exceed the maximum for that species

        The entitlement set out in paragraph 1 is a right to harvest in a manner

      <p class="schIndent2">a. is consistent with:</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. the communal nature of the Nisg̱a'a harvest for domestic purposes, and
      </p>

        <strong> 3. </strong>
        Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the Crown may authorize uses of or
        dispose of Crown land, and any authorized use or disposition may affect
        the methods, times, and locations of harvesting wildlife under Nisg̱a'a
        wildlife entitlements, provided that the Crown ensures that those
        authorized uses or dispositions do not:

        a. deny Nisg̱a'a citizens the reasonable opportunity to harvest wildlife

        lands.

        Notwithstanding that Nisg̱a'a wildlife entitlements are treaty rights, a

        allowable harvest has the same priority as the recreational and

        <strong> PREPAYMENTS </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In addition to any required loan repayment amount, at each anniversary,
        and up to three times during the first nine months after an anniversary,
        the Nisg̱a'a Nation may make loan prepayments to Canada. All prepayments
        will be applied to the outstanding scheduled loan repayment amount(s) in
        consecutive order from the effective date.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The "r" anniversary at which a prepayment is to be applied is the
        earliest anniversary for which a scheduled loan repayment amount, or a
        portion thereof, remains outstanding. Any loan prepayment applied to an
        outstanding loan repayment amount, or to a portion thereof, will be
        credited to the Nisg̱a'a Nation at its future value, as of the "r"
        anniversary, determined in accordance with the following formula:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Future Value = Prepayment * (1 + calculation rate)
        <sup> Zr </sup>
        * (1 + calculation rate * E/365)
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">where:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        "*" means multiplied by, and "/" means divided by,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Zr is the number of complete years between the date of the prepayment
        and the "r" anniversary,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        E is one plus the number of days between the date of the prepayment and
        the "r" anniversary, once the number of complete years referred to in
        "Zr" above has been deducted, and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">the calculation rate is x.xxx per cent per year.</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        [The rate to be inserted in the definition of the calculation rate is
        the most recently released rate of interest, as of the calculation date,
        that the Minister of Finance for Canada has approved on loans from the
        Consolidated Revenue Fund amortized over 14 years, less 0.125 per cent
        (specified to three decimal places of a per cent). The calculation date
        is a date 14 days before the signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement, or
        another date if the Parties agree, and is the same calculation date as
        that referred to in Schedule A. In this paragraph
        <span class="normal-bold-style">
          "signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement"
        </span>
        means signing by the Parties after the ratification by the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Ratification Chapter. This
        bracketed paragraph will be deleted on the date that Note 1 to this
        schedule is deleted.]
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        If the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding amount of
        the loan repayment amount scheduled for the "r" anniversary, the excess
        will be deemed to be a prepayment made on the "r" anniversary so that
        the future value of the excess will be applied as of the next "r"
        anniversary in a manner analogous to that described in this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On receipt of a loan prepayment, Canada will issue a letter to the
        Nisg̱a'a Nation setting out the amount of the prepayment received and the
        manner in which it will be applied in accordance with this "Prepayments"
        section of this schedule.
      </p>
      <p align="left">Illustrative Example:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Hypothetical calculation rate = 10.000%</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Annual equal payments of $100.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Prepayment = $100, made in year four at day 182</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Fifth anniversary payment has been previously prepaid
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount owing at fifth anniversary = $0.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount owing at sixth anniversary = $100.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1"></p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Therefore:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Zr = 1</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">E = 184</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">r = 6</p>
      <p class="schIndent1"></p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Future Value of prepayment made in year four at day 182 = $100.00 *
        (1+0.10000)
        <sup> 1 </sup>
        * (1 + 0.10000 * 184/365) = $115.55
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount prepaid for sixth anniversary = $100.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Amount in excess for sixth anniversary = $115.55 – $100.00 = $15.55
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Future value of $15.55 as of the seventh anniversary = $15.55 * (1 +
        0.10000)
        <sup> 1 </sup>
        * (1 + 0.10000 * 0/365) = $17.11
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount prepaid for seventh anniversary = $17.11</p>
      <p class="schIndent1"></p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        The prepayment made at day 182 in year four has eliminated the loan
        repayment amount for the sixth anniversary and reduced the loan
        repayment amount for the seventh anniversary from $100.00 to $82.89.

        <strong> Note 1 to Schedule B </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Canada will calculate in accordance with this note the actual loan
        repayment amounts for the eighth to 14th anniversaries inclusive to be
        inserted on the revision date in the final version of this schedule. In
        the final version of this schedule the loan repayment amounts for the
        effective date, and for the first to seventh anniversaries inclusive,
        will remain as set out in the initial version of this schedule.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The revision date is a date 14 days before the effective date, or
        another date if the Parties agree, and is the same revision date as that
        referred to in Schedule A.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On the revision date, Canada will calculate the amounts in the final
        schedule of loan repayment amounts for the eighth to 14
        <sup> th </sup>
        anniversaries, inclusive. These seven amounts will be equal amounts and
        each will be such that the net present value of all of the amounts in
        the final schedule of loan repayment amounts, discounted back to the
        effective date using the calculation rate (as described in the
        "Prepayment" section of this Schedule B) as the discount rate, will
        equal the loan amount.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In this schedule, the loan amount means the aggregate outstanding
        balance, at the effective date, of all negotiation and support loans,
        including principal and accrued interest, made by Canada to the Nisg̱a'a
        Tribal Council.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Canada will calculate the loan amount, based on a document that Canada
        and the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council will produce jointly before the
        initialling of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement. That document will set out
        the amounts of all loans from Canada to the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council,
        interest accrued to date and the relevant terms and conditions of those
        loans.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The document referred to in the previous paragraph will be available
        from either the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council or the Federal Treaty Negotiation
        Office of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development,
        upon request, as of the date of initialling of the Nisg̱a'a final
        agreement, to persons eligible to be enrolled as participants under that
        agreement.

      <p align="left">
        For information purposes (and not for calculation purposes), the

        Every five years, or at other intervals if the Parties agree, the
        Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on a fiscal
        financing agreement by which funding will be provided to the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation to enable the provision of agreed-upon public programs and
        services to Nisg̱a'a citizens and, where applicable, non-Nisg̱a'a
        occupants of Nisg̱a'a Lands, at levels reasonably comparable to those
        generally prevailing in northwest British Columbia.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 4. </strong>
        A fiscal financing agreement is not intended to be a treaty or land
        claims agreement, and is not intended to recognize or affirm aboriginal

        <strong> 5. </strong>
        The recognition of the legislative authority of Nisg̱a'a Lisims

        funding or financial obligation for Canada, British Columbia, the

        Nisg̱a'a citizens are eligible to participate in programs established by
        Canada or British Columbia and to receive public services from Canada or
        British Columbia, in accordance with general criteria established for
        those programs or services from time to time, to the extent that the
        Nisg̱a'a Nation has not assumed responsibility for those programs or
        public services under a fiscal financing agreement.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 7. </strong>
        The Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreements in respect of

        of property taxes.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">

        The funding for the Nisg̱a'a Nation and Nisg̱a'a Villages is a shared

        Parties that, where feasible, the reliance of the Nisg̱a'a Nation and

        Every 10 years, or at other intervals if the Parties agree, the Parties

        agreement under which Nisg̱a'a Nation own source revenue capacity, and
        the manner and extent to which that capacity will be taken into account
        under fiscal financing agreements, will be determined.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 15. </strong>
        An own source revenue agreement is not intended to be a treaty or land
        claims agreement, and is not intended to recognize or affirm aboriginal

        <strong> 16. </strong>
        In determining Nisg̱a'a Nation own source revenue capacity, the Parties
        will apply the following principles:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the own source revenue capacity in respect of any source will not be
        taken into account so as to unreasonably reduce the incentive for the
        Nisg̱a'a Nation or a Nisg̱a'a Village to raise revenues from that source
        or to occupy any tax room that other Canadian governments may have made
        available by agreement with the Nisg̱a'a Nation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. there should be a fair basis of comparison between the own source
        revenue capacity in respect of a Nisg̱a'a settlement trust and the
        additional tax revenue that Canadian governments would have received if
        the income and capital gains, net of losses, of the trust were earned or
        realized in equal shares by all Nisg̱a'a citizens, instead of by the
        trust, and if all Nisg̱a'a citizens were resident in British Columbia;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the own source revenue capacity in respect of each tax will not
        exceed the sum of:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. the value of any tax room made available in respect of the tax by
        Canada or British Columbia under an agreement referred to in
        subparagraph 3 (b) of the Taxation Chapter, or other agreement with the
        Nisg̱a'a Nation, and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. where the tax is similar to a tax generally imposed by local
        authorities in British Columbia:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        A. if the Nisg̱a'a Nation or a Nisg̱a'a Village is taxing only Nisg̱a'a
        citizens, the amount by which the revenues derived by the Nisg̱a'a Nation
        or the Nisg̱a'a Village from the tax exceed the amount, if any, included
        in subparagraph 16 (c) (i), or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        B. if there is a delegated taxation authority in respect of the tax,
        under an agreement referred to in subparagraph 3 (a) of the Taxation
        Chapter, the amount by which the tax capacity in respect of all persons
        over which Nisg̱a'a Government has taxation power or authority exceeds
        the amount included in subparagraph 16 (c) (i), and for this purpose,
        tax capacity will be determined on a fair and reasonable basis, taking
        into account the circumstances in Nisg̱a'a communities and in similar
        communities in northwest British Columbia;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. the own source revenue capacity in respect of commercial and
        investment activities, including exploitation of a natural resource, of
        the Nisg̱a'a Nation, the Nisg̱a'a Villages, Nisg̱a'a government
        corporations, Nisg̱a'a exempt corporations, and corporations without
        share capital established and operated for the benefit of the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation or a Nisg̱a'a Village, or any combination of them, will be
        reasonably comparable to, and not exceed, the additional revenues that
        other Canadian governments would have from taxation of those entities
        if:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. they were Canadian private enterprises subject to taxation under
        federal and provincial laws of general application,

        ii. the commercial and investment activities were their only activities,
      </p>

        iii. their only properties were properties related to the activities,
        and

        iv. those properties were owned by them as private persons and not as
        governments; and

      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. to the extent that a base is used in the calculation of a tax paid or
        payable by the Nisg̱a'a Nation, a Nisg̱a'a Village, a Nisg̱a'a government
        corporation, a Nisg̱a'a settlement trust, or a Nisg̱a'a exempt
        corporation, it will not be used as a base in the calculation of Nisg̱a'a

        Nisg̱a'a Nation own source revenue capacity in respect of any source not

        necessity of invoking this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 12. </strong>
        Except as otherwise provided, disagreements not resolved informally will

      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. Stage One: formal, unassisted efforts to reach agreement between or
        among the Parties, in collaborative negotiations under Appendix M-1;

        b. Stage Two: structured efforts to reach agreement between or among the
        Parties with the assistance of a neutral, who has no authority to
        resolve the dispute, in a facilitated process under Appendix M-2, M-3,
        M-4, or M-5 as applicable; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. Stage Three: final adjudication in arbitral proceedings under
        Appendix M-6, or in judicial proceedings.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 13. </strong>
        Except as otherwise provided, no Party may refer a disagreement to final
        adjudication in Stage Three without first proceeding through Stage One
        and a facilitated process in Stage Two as required in this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 14. </strong>
        Nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from commencing arbitral or
        judicial proceedings at any time:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. to prevent the loss of a right to commence proceedings due to the
        expiration of a limitation period; or

        b. to obtain interlocutory or interim relief that is otherwise available
        pending resolution of the disagreement under this Chapter.

        <strong> 15. </strong>
        If a disagreement is not resolved by informal discussion, and a Party
        directly engaged in the disagreement wishes to invoke this Chapter, that

        soon as practicable to the other Parties, requiring the commencement of
        collaborative negotiations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 16. </strong>
        Upon receiving the notice under paragraph 15, a Party directly engaged
        in the disagreement will participate in the collaborative negotiations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 17. </strong>
        A Party not directly engaged in the disagreement may participate in the
        collaborative negotiations by giving written notice to the other
        Parties, preferably before the collaborative negotiations commence.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 18. </strong>
        If the Parties have commenced negotiations in the circumstances
        described in subparagraph 7 (c), then, for all purposes under this
        Chapter, those negotiations will be deemed collaborative negotiations
        and the particular matter under negotiation will be considered a

        relocate the Licensee's structures and improvements that are materially
        affected by the cancellation in Section&nbsp;6.4 to a different location
        on the Land or the Utility Area, as the case may be, or to a location on
        other land immediately adjacent to the Land or the Utility Area (the

        Licensee, be of sufficient size to accommodate the Licensee's structures
        and improvements and be equally suitable for the purposes of the
        Licensee. The Owner will pay for any reasonable costs of moving the

        Licensee's structures and improvements cannot be moved to the New
        Location, the Owner will pay to the Licensee the reasonable costs of
        constructing new improvements on the New Location. As full compensation
        for all other costs, expenses and damages that the Licensee may incur in
        connection with the relocation, including disruption and loss of
        business, the parties shall agree on a lump sum payment and failing

        other term, condition, covenant, or other provision and the consent or

        hereunder shall be determined by the Owner acting reasonably. If the
        Owner, by written instrument, grants a license, right or interest to

        or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach of the same or any
        other term, condition, covenant, or other provision and the consent or

        relocate the Licensee's structures and improvements that are materially
        affected by the cancellation in Section&nbsp;6.4 to a different location
        on the Land or to a location on other land immediately adjacent to the
        Land (the "New Location"). The New Location must, in the reasonable
        opinion of the Licensee, be of sufficient size to accommodate the
        Licensee's structures and improvements and be equally suitable for the
        purposes of the Licensee. The Owner will pay for any reasonable costs of
        moving the Licensee and its structures and improvements to the New
        Location. If the Licensee's structures and improvements cannot be moved
        to the New Location, the Owner will pay to the Licensee the reasonable
        costs of constructing new improvements on the New Location. As full
        compensation for all other costs, expenses and damages that the Licensee
        may incur in connection with the relocation, including disruption and
        loss of business, the parties shall agree on a lump sum payment, and
        failing agreement, the matter shall be referred to arbitration pursuant
        to Article 10. All other terms and conditions of this license will apply
        to the New Location for the balance of the original term.

        Concurrently with the notice referred to in section 6.4, the Owner will
        give the licensee written notice that the Owner will, at its cost,
        relocate the Licensee's structures and improvements which are materially
        affected by the cancellation in Section 6.4 to a different location on
        the Land or to a location on other land immediately adjacent to the Land
        (the "New Location"). The New Location must, in the reasonable opinion
        of the Licensee, be of sufficient size to accommodate the Licensee's
        structures and improvements and be equally suitable for the purposes of
        the Licensee. The Owner will pay for any reasonable costs of moving the
        Licensee and its structures and improvements to the New Location. If the
        Licensee's structures and improvements cannot be moved to the New
        Location, the Owner will pay to the Licensee the reasonable costs of
        constructing new improvements on the New Location. As full compensation

        business, the parties shall agree on a lump sum payment and failing

        replaces or makes significant repairs to Licensed Hydro Works which are

        then, upon written notice from the Nisg̱a'a Nation and provided the
        relocation does not result in significant increased costs, and for a
        Crown road right of way area if the relocation is acceptable to British
        Columbia, Hydro will relocate the Licensed Hydro Works on to the
        adjacent right of way area, and the licence for those Licensed Hydro
        Works will be terminated;

        (d) the Nisg̱a'a Nation may at any time at no cost to Hydro require Hydro
        to enter into an agreement to extend the Hydro Right of Way Area so as
        to incorporate within the Hydro Right of Way Area any Licensed Hydro
        Works designated by the Nisg̱a'a Nation and upon the appropriate

        of way area if acceptable to British Columbia, or to a Hydro Right of
        Way Area and in that event:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        (i) if the new location is reasonably suitable for use for Hydro Works
        considering construction, maintenance and operation and costs, Hydro

      <p class="schIndent3">
        (ii) the Nisg̱a'a Nation will give reasonable notice to permit design,

        (iv) upon relocation, this licence is extended to the relocated Hydro
        Works, except if the relocated Hydro Works are located on a Crown road
        right of way area or a Hydro Right of Way Area, then the license for
        those Hydro Works will be terminated.

        The rights, liberties and rights of way granted under this Agreement are
        for so long as required and will terminate, without compensation to
        Hydro, when Hydro no longer requires the Hydro Right of Way Area, and:

        <strong> 8. Work Plans For Hydro Works </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Except in an emergency, Hydro will provide to the Nisg̱a'a Nation a
        written work plan describing proposed work on or related to a Hydro
        Right of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">

      <p class="schIndent2">
        (d) constructing any new trails, roads or bridges on the Hydro Right of
        Way Area.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Hydro will provide the work plan in time to afford the Nisg̱a'a Nation
        the opportunity to comment, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to
        accommodate any suggestions or requests presented by the Nisg̱a'a Nation
        provided they do not result in significant increased costs.

        (a) Hydro will, before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the
        Nisg̱a'a Nation indicating the location of the contemplated replacement

        (a) Hydro will before commencing any work deliver a written work plan

        the extent of the risk of not undertaking the work, and the impact on
        the Nisg̱a'a Lands. If Hydro and the Nisg̱a'a Nation cannot agree on a
        work plan requested by Hydro within 30 days of receipt by the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation of the proposed work plan then either party may refer the
        disagreement to dispute resolution under Paragraph 21 of this Agreement;

        a licence for all Licensed BC TEL Works to use and occupy Nisg̱a'a Lands
        on the following terms:

        replaces or makes significant repairs to Licensed BC TEL Works which are
        adjacent to a Crown road right of way area or a BC TEL Right of Way Area
        then, upon written notice from the Nisg̱a'a Nation and provided the
        relocation does not result in significant increased costs, and for a
        Crown road right of way area if the relocation is acceptable to British
        Columbia, BC TEL will relocate the Licensed BC TEL Works on to the

        TEL Works designated by the Nisg̱a'a Nation and upon the appropriate

        of way area if acceptable to British Columbia, or to a BC TEL Right of
        Way Area and in that event:

      <p class="schIndent3">
        (i) if the new location is reasonably suitable for use for BC TEL Works

        <strong> 8. Work Plans For BC TEL Works </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Except in an emergency BC TEL will provide to the Nisg̱a'a Nation a
        written work plan describing proposed work on or related to a BC TEL
        Right of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) installation of any new telecommunication lines;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">(b) relocation of any telecommunication lines;</p>

      <p class="schIndent2">
        (d) constructing any new trails, roads or bridges on the BC TEL Right of
        Way Area.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        BC TEL will provide the work plan in time to afford the Nisg̱a'a Nation
        the opportunity to comment, and BC TEL will use reasonable efforts to
        accommodate any suggestions or requests presented by the Nisg̱a'a Nation
        provided they do not result in significant increased costs.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> 9. Insurance and Security </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        If British Columbia requires BC TEL to carry insurance, to provide
        security, or both, in relation to rights of way granted to BC TEL by
        British Columbia, then on request of the Nisg̱a'a Nation, BC TEL will
        obtain insurance, security, or both, for the benefit of the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation on terms substantially the same as required by British Columbia.

      <p align="left">
        <strong> 10. Access to BC TEL Rights of Way </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        If for any reason BC TEL is unable to obtain reasonable access to any BC
        TEL Works from the BC TEL Right of Way Area, a Crown road, a Nisg̱a'a
        road or a BC TEL private access right of way, then the Nisg̱a'a Nation
        will, where land access is reasonably practicable, on application from
        BC TEL, grant BC TEL the right to cross Nisg̱a'a Lands to provide BC TEL
        access on terms substantially the same as contained in Document 3 of
        Appendix C-4 to the Final Agreement.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> 11. Protection of the Environment </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        BC TEL will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement having
        regard for the impact on the environment, and will take prudent measures
        to minimize damage or disruption to the environment.

      <p align="left">
        <strong> 12. Replacement Right of Way </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        If a material change occurs to lands which for any reason makes the
        continued use of any portion of the BC TEL Right of Way Area unsuitable
        for the BC TEL Purposes, then the Nisg̱a'a Nation will, without charge,
        grant a replacement right of way to BC&nbsp;TEL for construction of the
        replacement BC TEL Works, as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) BC TEL will, before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the
        Nisg̱a'a Nation indicating the location of the contemplated replacement
        right of way area, for approval by the Nisg̱a'a Nation which approval
        will not be unreasonably withheld;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) BC TEL will take into account the effect of the replacement right of
        way area on adjacent Nisg̱a'a Lands, and any unique aspects of these
        lands, and the Nisg̱a'a Nation will take into account the cost
        efficiencies of the location selected by BC TEL for a replacement right
        of way area in relation to alternative locations;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (c) the replacement right of way agreement will be on the same terms and
        conditions as this Agreement, and the Nisg̱a'a Nation will use its best
        efforts to ensure that the replacement right of way has the same
        priority over other charges and encumbrances as this Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (d) BC TEL will execute a release of this Agreement in relation to the
        portions of the abandoned BC TEL Right of Way Area.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Despite any provision of this paragraph, in an emergency BC TEL may,
        without approval from the Nisg̱a'a Nation, enter on to Nisg̱a'a Lands to
        undertake all work and take all steps as are reasonably required to be
        taken immediately in order to restore electrical and telecommunication
        services, or to ensure safety of persons and property that may be at
        risk from BC TEL Works. BC TEL will give notice as soon as reasonably
        possible to the Nisg̱a'a Nation of any emergency entry.

        Works, or to protect persons and property that may be at risk from BC
        TEL Works, as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) BC TEL will before commencing any work deliver a written work plan
        describing the effect and extent of the proposed work on Nisg̱a'a Lands

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) the Nisg̱a'a Nation will not unreasonably withhold approval of the
        work plan, considering the effect of the proposed work, including the
        cost of the proposed works compared to the cost of alternate solutions,
        the extent of the risk of not undertaking the work, and the impact on
        the Nisg̱a'a Lands. If BC TEL and the Nisg̱a'a Nation cannot agree on a
        work plan requested by BC TEL within 30 days of receipt by the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation of the proposed work plan then either party may refer the
        disagreement to dispute resolution under Paragraph 21 of this Agreement;
      </p>

        BC TEL Works, or to protect persons and property that may be at risk
        from BC TEL Works, and in that event BC TEL will as soon as reasonably

        <strong> 15. Relocation of BC TEL Works </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        If the Nisg̱a'a Nation requires a portion of a BC TEL Right of Way Area
        for other purposes, then upon request by the Nisg̱a'a Nation, BC TEL will
        relocate any BC TEL Right of Way Area including the related BC TEL
        Works, to a new location as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) the relocation will proceed only if the new location is reasonably
        suitable for use for BC TEL Works considering construction, maintenance
        and operation and costs; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) the Nisg̱a'a Nation will give reasonable notice to permit design,
        planning and construction of the BC TEL Works to be relocated; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (c) the Nisg̱a'a Nation will pay all reasonable costs, including costs of
        design, supervision and construction.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        The Nisg̱a'a Nation will extend the BC TEL Right of Way Area as
        reasonably required, so that the extended BC TEL Right of Way Area has
        similar priority over other charges and encumbrances as the original.
        When a portion of a BC TEL Right of Way Area is relocated then the BC
        TEL Right of Way Area for the portion that is abandoned will be
        terminated.

        <strong> 16. Indemnity </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        BC TEL will indemnify and save harmless the Nisg̱a'a Nation from and
        against all losses, damages, costs, liabilities, claims, expenses, and
        suits, including fees of solicitors and other professional advisors,
        arising out of:
      </p>

        (a) any breach, violation or non-performance by BC TEL of any of BC

      <p class="schIndent1">
        This Agreement will not entitle Hydro to exclusive possession of the
        Hydro Access Road Areas or other parts of the Nisg̱a'a Lands and the

        <strong> 5. Duration </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        In respect of a Hydro Access Road Area, the rights, liberties and rights

        terminate, without compensation to Hydro, when:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) the Hydro right of way that the Hydro Access Road Area serves

        <strong> 6. Work Plans For Hydro Access Roads </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Except in an emergency, Hydro will provide to the Nisg̱a'a Nation a
        written work plan describing proposed work on or related to a Hydro
        Access Road Area prior to undertaking the construction or development of
        any Hydro Access Road. Hydro will provide the work plan in time to
        afford the Nisg̱a'a Nation the opportunity to comment, and Hydro will use
        reasonable efforts to accommodate any suggestions or requests presented
        by the Nisg̱a'a Nation provided they do not result in significant
        increased costs.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> 7. Protection of the Environment </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Hydro will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement having
        regard for the impact on the environment, and will take prudent measures
        to minimize damage or disruption to the environment.

      <p align="left">
        <strong>
          8. Entry on Nisg̱a'a Lands outside the Hydro Right of Way Areas
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Hydro, and its employees, representatives, agents, contractors,
        licensees and assignees, may enter onto Nisg̱a'a Lands outside the Hydro
        Access Road Areas for the purpose of undertaking works to protect Hydro
        Access Roads, or to protect persons and property, as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) Hydro will before commencing any work deliver a written work plan
        describing the effect and extent of the proposed work on Nisg̱a'a Lands
        to the Nisg̱a'a Nation for approval;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) the Nisg̱a'a Nation will not unreasonably withhold approval of the
        work plan, considering the effect of the proposed work, including the
        cost of the proposed works compared to the cost of alternate solutions,
        the extent of the risk of not undertaking the work, and the impact on
        the Nisg̱a'a Lands. If Hydro and the Nisg̱a'a Nation cannot agree on a
        work plan requested by Hydro within 30 days of receipt by the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation of the proposed work plan, then either party may refer the
        disagreement to dispute resolution under Paragraph 14 of this Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (c) Hydro will minimize the damage to and time spent on Nisg̱a'a Lands;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (d) Hydro will pay fair compensation, as defined in the Final Agreement,
        for any interference with or damage to adjacent Nisg̱a'a Lands.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Notwithstanding other provisions of this paragraph or this Agreement, in
        an emergency Hydro may undertake works and take steps on Nisg̱a'a Lands
        as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to protect
        Hydro Access Roads, and in that event Hydro will as soon as reasonably
        possible notify the Nisg̱a'a Nation in writing.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> 9. Relocation of Hydro Access Road Areas </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        If the Nisg̱a'a Nation requires a portion of a Hydro Access Road Area for
        another purpose, then upon request by the Nisg̱a'a Nation, Hydro will
        relocate any Hydro Access Road Area, including the related Hydro Access
        Road, to a new location as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) the relocation will proceed only if the new location is reasonably
        suitable for use for a Hydro Access Road considering construction,
        maintenance and operation and costs; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) the Nisg̱a'a Nation will give reasonable notice to permit design,
        planning and construction of the Hydro Access Road to be relocated; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (c) the Nisg̱a'a Nation will pay all reasonable costs, including costs of
        design, supervision and construction.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        The Nisg̱a'a Nation will extend a Hydro Access Road Area as reasonably
        required, so that the extended Hydro Access Road Area has similar
        priority over other charges and encumbrances as the original. When a
        portion of a Hydro Access Road Area is relocated, then the Hydro Access
        Road Area for the portion that is abandoned will be terminated.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> 10. Indemnity </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">

        against all losses, damages, costs, liabilities, claims, expenses, and
        suits, including fees of solicitors and other professional advisors,
        arising out of:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) any breach, violation or non-performance by Hydro of any of Hydro's
        covenants, conditions or obligations under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) any personal injury, death, or property damage, including
        environmental damage, occurring on or to Nisg̱a'a Lands arising from
        Hydro's use or occupation of Nisg̱a'a Lands under this Agreement,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        but not for any claims based on nuisance or the rule in
        <em> Rylands v Fletcher </em>
        unless Hydro was negligent.

      <p align="left">

        If a Party commences legal proceedings in a court against another Party
        in respect of a matter required or agreed to be submitted to

        entering an appearance, and before delivery of any pleadings or taking
        any other step in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the

        A plea that an arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction must be

      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 48. </strong>
        If an arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has
