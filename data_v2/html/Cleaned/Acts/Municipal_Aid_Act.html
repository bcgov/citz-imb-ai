          At the times and in the manner the Lieutenant Governor in Council may
          prescribe, the minister must in each year pay from the consolidated
          revenue fund to each municipality a grant equal to the product
          obtained by multiplying the assessed value of Provincial land and
          improvements on it in the municipality by the rate, including debt,
          fixed by the municipality in that year for general municipal and
          regional district taxation purposes.

          The assessed values of Provincial land and improvements on it to be
          used for the calculation of grants under subsection (1) must be
          determined by the British Columbia Assessment Authority as at December
          31 of the preceding year and the British Columbia Assessment Authority
          must certify the assessed values so determined to the minister on or
          before April 15 in each year.

          the grant payable under subsection&nbsp;(1) is less than the grant
          paid to the municipality in 1977, subsection&nbsp;(1) does not apply
          and instead the minister must pay from the consolidated revenue fund a
          grant equal to the grant paid to the municipality on Provincial land
          and improvements on it in 1977.
