          If a domestic enactment is repealed and not replaced with a domestic
          enactment in relation to the same subject matter, a reference in an
          unrepealed enactment of British Columbia to the domestic enactment is
          to be construed, for a subsequent transaction, matter or thing, as a
          reference to the repealed domestic enactment as it read immediately
          before its repeal.
