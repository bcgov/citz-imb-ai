          In determining all questions relating to compensation, the minister
          must be guided by the principle that as the survey was undertaken for
          the benefit of all registered owners within the special survey area,
          such registered owners should in proportion to the area of their
          respective parcels share any loss and any advantage occasioned by and
          accruing from the special survey, and that if for the general benefit
          or for the preservation of individual improvements the surveyor has
          reduced the area of any parcel, the registered owner should receive
          compensation from the registered owner benefited or from a general
          fund formed by payments from the registered owners benefited, as the
          case may be, and that any registered owner who has been benefited
          should contribute an adequate amount to the general fund or pay it to
          the registered owner who has suffered loss, as the case may be.
