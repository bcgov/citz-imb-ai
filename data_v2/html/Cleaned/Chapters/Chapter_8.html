        Notwithstanding that Nisg̱a'a fish entitlements are treaty rights, a

        In every year in which it is necessary for conservation, the Minister

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 12. </strong>
        The Minister will not permit any directed harvests of a species of Nass

      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. there is a minimum escapement level for that species of Nass salmon;

        The amount of each species of Nass salmon in the Nisg̱a'a fish

        Nass salmon, in accordance with Schedule B.

        Nisg̱a'a fisheries will be adjusted in subsequent years, in accordance
        with Schedule B.

        <strong> 17. </strong>
        In every year the Minister will manage all Canadian fisheries that

      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 1. </strong>
        For the purpose of catch accounting, harvests for each salmon species
        are classified into two groups of fisheries:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. Nisg̱a'a fisheries; and</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. other Canadian fisheries harvesting Nass salmon.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 2. </strong>
        To determine the overage or underage for a Nass salmon species in
        Nisg̱a'a fisheries, the following post-season estimates are required for
        each species of salmon:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the total return to Canada (the "TRTC") for that species of Nass
        salmon;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the total escapement to Nass Area streams (the "Post-Season
        Escapement Estimate");
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the harvest share for Nisg̱a'a fisheries (the "Nisg̱a'a Share") for
        that year determined in accordance with the Nisg̱a'a fish allocations set
        out in the Fisheries Chapter and the Harvest Agreement using the
        post-season estimate of the TRTC and the escapement goal for that year,
        including any adjustments to the Nisg̱a'a Share for overages and
        underages;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. the harvest allowed for other Canadian fisheries (the "Remaining
        Allowable Catch") based on the post-season estimate of TRTC, the
        escapement goal and the Nisg̱a'a Share for that year;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. the total number of fish of that species caught in Nisg̱a'a fisheries
        (the "Nisg̱a'a Catch");
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">

        g. the total catch for a year (the "Total Catch") determined by adding
        the Nisg̱a'a Catch to the Other Catch.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 3. </strong>
        In each year, the Nisg̱a'a Account will be calculated for each species,
        as set out below, to determine if an overage or underage has occurred
        for that species. If the Nisg̱a'a Account is a number greater than zero,
        then there is an overage. If the Nisg̱a'a Account is a number less than
        zero, then there is an underage.

        a. if the Post-Season Escapement Estimate is greater than or equal to
        the escapement goal and the Minister has provided reasonable

        Nisg̱a'a Catch is less than the Nisg̱a'a Share, and the Other Catch is
