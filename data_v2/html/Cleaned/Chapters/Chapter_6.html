        access to Nisg̱a'a Lands as other owners of estates in fee simple have in
        respect of public access to their land, and in respect of Nisg̱a'a Public

        Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government will allow reasonable public access to and
        onto Nisg̱a'a Public Lands for temporary non-commercial and recreational

          Public Access for Hunting and Fishing on Nisg̱a'a Public Lands
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 4. </strong>
        Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government will provide reasonable opportunities for the
        public to hunt and fish on Nisg̱a'a Public Lands but, as the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation is the owner of the land on the effective date, only Nisg̱a'a
        citizens have the right to hunt and fish on Nisg̱a'a Lands.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 5. </strong>
        Hunting and fishing by the public under paragraph 4 will be in
        accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7, federal and provincial laws of
        general application, annual management plans, and any laws enacted by
        Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government regulating public access.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 6. </strong>
        An annual management plan will specify the level of harvest of each
        designated species, and any other species that the Minister and Nisg̱a'a
        Lisims Government agree should be included in the annual management
        plan, that may be harvested on Nisg̱a'a Public Lands by persons other
        than Nisg̱a'a citizens, having regard to Nisg̱a'a preferences for
        harvesting wildlife under Nisg̱a'a wildlife entitlements on Nisg̱a'a
        Lands, and the availability of that species in the rest of the Nass
        Wildlife Area.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 7. </strong>
        Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government may, for the purpose of monitoring and
        regulating public access for hunting and fishing under paragraph 4,
        require persons other than Nisg̱a'a citizens to obtain a permit or
        licence. Those permits or licences will be reasonably available at a
        reasonable fee taking into account the administrative and other costs of
        the monitoring and regulating.

        <strong> 8. </strong>
        Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government and British Columbia will take reasonable
        measures to notify the public of terms and conditions in respect of
        public access to and onto Nisg̱a'a Public Lands.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 9. </strong>
        Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government will consult with Canada and British Columbia
        in respect of any proposed Nisg̱a'a laws that would significantly affect
        the regulation of public access to and onto Nisg̱a'a Public Lands.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 10. </strong>
        Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government will notify Canada and British Columbia of the
        location and boundaries of Nisg̱a'a Village Lands and Nisg̱a'a Private
        Lands.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 11. </strong>
        If Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government intends to change the locations or
        boundaries of Nisg̱a'a Village Lands or Nisg̱a'a Private Lands, it will
        provide reasonable notice to British Columbia and Canada of the proposed
        changes.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> 12. </strong>
        If Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government intends to change the locations or
        boundaries of Nisg̱a'a Village Lands or Nisg̱a'a Private Lands, it will
        take reasonable steps to notify the public, and it will consider any
        views advanced in respect of the proposed changes by any individual who
        would be adversely affected, but the changes may not be set aside on the
        ground of insufficient notice.

        <strong> 13. </strong>
        If the designation of Nisg̱a'a Public Lands as Nisg̱a'a Village Lands or
        Nisg̱a'a Private Lands has the effect of preventing public access to an
        area or location to which there is a public right of access under
        federal or provincial laws of general application such as navigable
        waters or Crown roads, Nisg̱a'a Lisims Government will provide reasonable
        alternative means of public access to that area or location.
