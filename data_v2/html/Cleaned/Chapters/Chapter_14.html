        means an anniversary of the effective date.

        <strong> PREPAYMENTS </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In addition to any required loan repayment amount, at each anniversary,
        and up to three times during the first nine months after an anniversary,
        the Nisg̱a'a Nation may make loan prepayments to Canada. All prepayments
        will be applied to the outstanding scheduled loan repayment amount(s) in
        consecutive order from the effective date.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The "r" anniversary at which a prepayment is to be applied is the
        earliest anniversary for which a scheduled loan repayment amount, or a
        portion thereof, remains outstanding. Any loan prepayment applied to an
        outstanding loan repayment amount, or to a portion thereof, will be
        credited to the Nisg̱a'a Nation at its future value, as of the "r"
        anniversary, determined in accordance with the following formula:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Future Value = Prepayment * (1 + calculation rate)
        <sup> Zr </sup>
        * (1 + calculation rate * E/365)
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">where:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        "*" means multiplied by, and "/" means divided by,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Zr is the number of complete years between the date of the prepayment
        and the "r" anniversary,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        E is one plus the number of days between the date of the prepayment and
        the "r" anniversary, once the number of complete years referred to in
        "Zr" above has been deducted, and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">the calculation rate is x.xxx per cent per year.</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        [The rate to be inserted in the definition of the calculation rate is
        the most recently released rate of interest, as of the calculation date,
        that the Minister of Finance for Canada has approved on loans from the
        Consolidated Revenue Fund amortized over 14 years, less 0.125 per cent
        (specified to three decimal places of a per cent). The calculation date
        is a date 14 days before the signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement, or
        another date if the Parties agree, and is the same calculation date as
        that referred to in Schedule A. In this paragraph
        <span class="normal-bold-style">
          "signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement"
        </span>
        means signing by the Parties after the ratification by the Nisg̱a'a
        Nation in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Ratification Chapter. This
        bracketed paragraph will be deleted on the date that Note 1 to this
        schedule is deleted.]
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        If the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding amount of
        the loan repayment amount scheduled for the "r" anniversary, the excess
        will be deemed to be a prepayment made on the "r" anniversary so that
        the future value of the excess will be applied as of the next "r"
        anniversary in a manner analogous to that described in this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On receipt of a loan prepayment, Canada will issue a letter to the
        Nisg̱a'a Nation setting out the amount of the prepayment received and the
        manner in which it will be applied in accordance with this "Prepayments"
        section of this schedule.
      </p>
      <p align="left">Illustrative Example:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Hypothetical calculation rate = 10.000%</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Annual equal payments of $100.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Prepayment = $100, made in year four at day 182</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Fifth anniversary payment has been previously prepaid
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount owing at fifth anniversary = $0.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount owing at sixth anniversary = $100.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1"></p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Therefore:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Zr = 1</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">E = 184</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">r = 6</p>
      <p class="schIndent1"></p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Future Value of prepayment made in year four at day 182 = $100.00 *
        (1+0.10000)
        <sup> 1 </sup>
        * (1 + 0.10000 * 184/365) = $115.55
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount prepaid for sixth anniversary = $100.00</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Amount in excess for sixth anniversary = $115.55 – $100.00 = $15.55
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        Future value of $15.55 as of the seventh anniversary = $15.55 * (1 +
        0.10000)
        <sup> 1 </sup>
        * (1 + 0.10000 * 0/365) = $17.11
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">Amount prepaid for seventh anniversary = $17.11</p>
      <p class="schIndent1"></p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        The prepayment made at day 182 in year four has eliminated the loan
        repayment amount for the sixth anniversary and reduced the loan
        repayment amount for the seventh anniversary from $100.00 to $82.89.

        Note 1 to this Schedule will be deleted, and will no longer form part of

      <p align="left">
        <strong> Note 1 to Schedule B </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Canada will calculate in accordance with this note the actual loan
        repayment amounts for the eighth to 14th anniversaries inclusive to be
        inserted on the revision date in the final version of this schedule. In
        the final version of this schedule the loan repayment amounts for the
        effective date, and for the first to seventh anniversaries inclusive,
        will remain as set out in the initial version of this schedule.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The revision date is a date 14 days before the effective date, or
        another date if the Parties agree, and is the same revision date as that
        referred to in Schedule A.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On the revision date, Canada will calculate the amounts in the final
        schedule of loan repayment amounts for the eighth to 14
        <sup> th </sup>
        anniversaries, inclusive. These seven amounts will be equal amounts and
        each will be such that the net present value of all of the amounts in
        the final schedule of loan repayment amounts, discounted back to the
        effective date using the calculation rate (as described in the
        "Prepayment" section of this Schedule B) as the discount rate, will
        equal the loan amount.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In this schedule, the loan amount means the aggregate outstanding
        balance, at the effective date, of all negotiation and support loans,
        including principal and accrued interest, made by Canada to the Nisg̱a'a
        Tribal Council.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Canada will calculate the loan amount, based on a document that Canada
        and the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council will produce jointly before the
        initialling of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement. That document will set out
        the amounts of all loans from Canada to the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council,
        interest accrued to date and the relevant terms and conditions of those
        loans.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The document referred to in the previous paragraph will be available
        from either the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council or the Federal Treaty Negotiation
        Office of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development,
        upon request, as of the date of initialling of the Nisg̱a'a final
        agreement, to persons eligible to be enrolled as participants under that
        agreement.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        For information purposes (and not for calculation purposes), the
        approximate amount of outstanding loans, including principal and accrued
        interest, as of the date that settlement legislation is introduced in
        Parliament, will be inserted in the following blank space before that
        date: ____________.
