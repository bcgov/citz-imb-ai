      <bcl:indent1>2.9 The designated rating organization will assess whether the methodologies and models used for determining credit ratings of a securitized product are appropriate when the risk characteristics of the assets underlying the securitized product change significantly. If the quality of the available information is not satisfactory or if the complexity of a new type of structure, instrument or security should reasonably raise concerns about whether the designated rating organization can provide a credible rating, the designated rating organization will not issue or maintain a credit rating.</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:indent1>2.19 The designated rating organization and its ratings employees and agents will not, either implicitly or explicitly, give any assurance or guarantee of a particular rating prior to a rating assessment.
