          <sectiontext>In order to further the objectives described in paragraphs (a) and (c) of the definition of "government's energy objectives" in section 1 of the Act, the commission must exercise its powers and perform its duties under the Act in accordance with the criterion that, beginning on the date this direction comes into force, the authority must plan to rely on Burrard Thermal for no more than the following:</sectiontext>
          <paragraph>
            <paragraphnumber>a</paragraphnumber>
            <paragraphtext>900 megawatts of capacity;</paragraphtext>

          <paragraph>

          <sectionnumber>4</sectionnumber>
          <sectiontext>In setting rates for the authority, the commission must ensure that those rates allow the authority to collect sufficient revenue in each fiscal year to enable the authority to acquire sufficient energy to meet its electricity supply obligations without planning to rely on Burrard Thermal for more firm energy or capacity than is specified in section 3.</sectiontext>
