        <strong>(e) What is Material?</strong>
      </lefttext>
      <indent1>Would a reasonable investor's decision to buy, sell or hold securities of an investment fund likely be influenced or changed if the information in question was omitted or misstated? If so, the information is material. This concept of materiality is consistent with the financial reporting notion of materiality contained in the Handbook. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors.</indent1>
      <lefttext>
        <strong>(f) Terminology</strong>
      </lefttext>
      <indent1>All references to "net assets" or "net assets per security" in this Form are references to net assets determined in accordance with Canadian GAAP as presented in the financial statements of the investment fund. All references to "net asset value" or "net asset value per security" in this Form are references to net asset value determined in accordance with Part 14 of the Instrument.</indent1>
      <indent1> Investment funds must use net assets as shown on the financial statements in the "The Fund's Net Assets per [Unit/Share]" table. All other calculations for the purposes of the MRFP must be made using net asset value.</indent1>

      <indent1> "This annual management report of fund performance contains financial highlights but does not contain the complete annual financial statements of the investment fund.
