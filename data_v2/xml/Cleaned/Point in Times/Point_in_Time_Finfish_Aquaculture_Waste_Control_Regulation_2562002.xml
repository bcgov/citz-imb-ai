            <strong>Baseline Inventory</strong>
          </centertext>
          <centertext>[am. B.C. Reg. 321/2004, s. 10 (p).]</centertext>
          <centertext>
            <strong>Part I — Currents Metering</strong>
          </centertext>
          <lefttext>The following ocean currents metering information is required for registration.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>The currents regime at the site must be characterized at 2 depths: approximately 15 metres below the surface and approximately 5 metres above the bottom. Current direction must be measured in degrees true and current speed in centimetres per second. Speed and direction must be recorded at least once every 30 minutes for a period of at least 30 days. The locations where currents are metered must represent currents within the tenure, especially near containment structures and containment structure arrays. Follow the protocols for collecting currents data that appear in Section 1 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002).</lefttext>
          <centertext>
            <strong>Part II — Baseline Monitoring</strong>
          </centertext>
          <lefttext>
            <strong>A. Seabed Characterization</strong>
          </lefttext>
          <lefttext>A baseline survey of the seabed within the tenure and at at least 2 reference stations is required. The baseline survey must achieve the following objectives:</lefttext>
          <indent1>• describe variation in substrata, topography and bathymetry throughout the tenure and at reference stations</indent1>
          <indent1>• locate reference stations with similar depths, substrata and other features</indent1>
          <indent1>• determine the feasibility of collecting sediment grab samples and identify areas that need video survey for operational monitoring</indent1>
          <indent1>• collect physical and biological data to compare with data collected during the operational period and to estimate the number of samples needed for operational monitoring.</indent1>
          <lefttext>Surveys of the probable footprints for all proposed locations of the containment structures, or containment structure arrays, are required. They must include enough transects to map all biophysical characteristics to a resolution of 50 metres. To describe depth variation, at least one transect must run perpendicular to the shore starting from the landward boundary of the tenure and running to its opposite perimeter.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>
            <strong>B. Video Survey</strong>
          </lefttext>
          <lefttext>Each reference station must have 2 video transects, each at least 100 metres long, including one perpendicular to shore. The transects must run straight, with start and end points recorded for future reference.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Surveys must characterize substratum types as bedrock, boulder (&gt;256 millimetres in diameter), cobble (64-256 millimetres in diameter), gravel (2-64 millimetres in diameter), sand (0.0625-2 millimetres in diameter), silt, mud and clay (&lt;0.0625 millimetres in diameter), or shell hash. For combination substrata, relative proportions must be noted (e.g. 50% bedrock: 50% boulder). Some will have associations of organisms or other features which must be identified.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>In areas where sediment grab sampling is not possible, the abundances of megafauna, macrofauna and macrophytes must be measured. For megafauna, record moving images along transects. For macrofauna, take still images of quadrats. For macrophytes, use both. There must be enough quadrats to adequately represent each substratum type within all probable footprints. At reference stations, 5 quadrats must be sampled midway on the transects. All images, whether moving or still, must be clear enough for counting and measuring the biota cover. All biota must be taxonomically identified to at least the level of class.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Sediment colour and the presence or absence of fish feed, fish faeces, flocculent organic material, macrophytes, terrigenous material and farm litter must also be recorded for each transect and quadrat. These observations are needed for proper comparison with observations made during operational monitoring. Unique seabed features or areas of interest must also be mapped.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>The baseline survey must follow the protocols for video surveys in section 2 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002) unless an alternative method has been authorized by a director, and the alternative method will meet the objectives for the baseline survey set out at the beginning of this Part.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>
            <strong>C. Sediment Sampling</strong>
          </lefttext>
          <lefttext>Following conduct of the video or alternate survey, sediment grab sampling is required wherever physically possible.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Grab sampling obtains physical, chemical and biological data to be used to determine the number of samples needed for operational monitoring and to be compared against the operational data. Within each of the probable footprint or accumulated probable footprints a minimum of 3 grab samples must be taken for each sediment type and if only one sediment type is present, then a minimum of 5 grab samples must be taken. Two reference stations must be selected (as described for video surveys above) and at least 3 grabs must be taken at each reference station. Follow the sediment sampling protocols in Sections 3 and 4 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002).</lefttext>
          <lefttext>The following physical and chemical parameters must be measured whenever a sediment grab sample is taken:</lefttext>
          <indent1>• free sulphides<footnoteref>1</footnoteref></indent1>
          <indent1>• redox potential<footnoteref>1</footnoteref></indent1>
          <indent1>• total volatile solids or total organic carbon</indent1>
          <indent1>• sediment grain size (% gravel, sand, silt, mud and clay)</indent1>
          <indent1>• total zinc (at sites where zinc is used in feed formulations)</indent1>
          <indent1>• total copper (at sites where copper is used as an antifouling agent)</indent1>
          <indent1>• other contaminants (if required by a director) such as pesticides, therapeutic additives, therapeutants, pharmaceuticals, wood preservatives and   persistent organic compounds</indent1>
          <indent1>• other parameters if required by a director.</indent1>
          <lefttext>Record this additional information:</lefttext>
          <indent1>• sediment colour, odour and texture</indent1>
          <indent1>• presence or absence of gas bubbles, Beggiatoa, fish feed, fish faeces, flocculent organic material, macrophytes, terrigenous material and farm litter.</indent1>
          <lefttext>Biota must be taxonomically identified to the level of species and counted. Also identify and count individuals of Capitella. After being processed, samples must be archived for at least 5 years. These samples must be properly stored and maintained.</lefttext>
          <centertext>
            <strong>Part III — Reporting</strong>
          </centertext>
          <lefttext>The location of each substratum type, currents metering, facility sampling stations, reference stations and transects must be reported on maps. Appropriate scale must be used for easy identification. Qualified professionals providing positional information must be aware that DGPS is not always available to adequate resolution (± 10 m) because of the topography of adjacent land or for other reasons. Therefore, alternative methods of positioning may be needed.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Another map must show depths across the tenure and at reference stations. Map contours must be at a maximum of 10-metre intervals (or equivalent intervals expressed in alternative units). Marine charts may be used, provided that they report the 10-metre depth interval and are accurate for the specific site. However, companies may choose to collect their own bottom contour information if accurate charts are not available, or to be consistent with other information, such as a profile view of the facility.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Data submissions for currents metering (at both depths) must include:</lefttext>
          <indent1>• electronic files of the raw data, indicating current speed and direction for each sampling interval</indent1>
          <indent1>• hard copies of the summary data presented in tabular frequency distribution.</indent1>
          <lefttext>The data must be provided in an electronic ASCII or MS Excel file format. The data must also be accompanied by adequate reporting information as indicated below. The hard-copy summaries must show current speed and current direction.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Both raw data and summary data must include measurements made between the first and the last good record time only. All data recorded before or after complete deployment of the meter must be removed prior to submission.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Videotape submissions must be accompanied by a detailed narrative or written assessment prepared by a qualified professional describing benthic conditions along transects and in quadrats. The video and report must identify the location of each transect and the location of the camera along each transect.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>All physical, chemical and biological data gathered from video surveys and sediment sampling must be submitted in a standard electronic format. Spreadsheet templates, available from WLAP, are to be used for submitting these data and other information. Each data submission must be accompanied by a statement indicating that these Schedules and the Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002) were followed. If there are any deviations from these, there must also be a written statement justifying the deviations.</lefttext>

          <centertext>
            <strong>Operational Monitoring</strong>
          </centertext>
          <centertext>[am. B.C. Reg. 321/2004, s. 10 (q) and (r).]</centertext>
          <lefttext>The main purposes of operational monitoring are to determine whether a facility meets chemical and biological requirements and standards, and to define the spatial and temporal extent of the facility's effects. All monitoring programs must have the basic study design features described in Section 7 and Appendices of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002). Any additional design features must be provided by a qualified professional.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>The probable footprint of the waste discharges must be determined prior to designing the impact study. Methods to estimate that footprint may include currents metering, video surveys, sonar techniques, reconnaissance grab sampling, hydrodynamic modeling or other methods.</lefttext>
          <centertext>
            <strong>Part I — Hard Bottom Survey</strong>
          </centertext>
          <lefttext>If satisfactory sediment samples cannot be obtained using grab samplers — because of hard surfaces, rocks or other coarse material — perform a video survey, or an alternative hard bottom survey if an alternative method is approved by a director, of the footprint or accumulated footprints. Have it analyzed by a qualified professional as described in Schedule A following the methods described in Section 2 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002).</lefttext>
          <lefttext>For video surveys, the following 2 types of video surveys must be conducted:</lefttext>
          <lefttext>
            <strong>Megafauna transect survey</strong>
          </lefttext>
          <lefttext>This identifies and quantifies megafauna and macrophytes from moving images obtained along transects. These transects may also be used to define the extent of observable physical and biological changes, such as sediment colour, presence of organic sediments, feed pellets, farm litter or Beggiatoa mats.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>
            <strong>Macrofauna quadrat survey</strong>
          </lefttext>
          <lefttext>This consists of still images of quadrats used to identify and quantify macrofauna and macrophytes. These are normally on or adjacent to the megafauna transect.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Each transect must start at the perimeter of the containment structure, or containment structure array, and extend to the perimeter of the tenure, along the prevailing current. There must be one transect for each of 2 dominant current directions of each containment structure or array. If adjacent containment structures, or arrays, are less than 60 m apart, they must be treated as if they were a single array when transects are positioned. A transect must not extend beneath an adjacent containment structure or array.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Alternate transect designs might be acceptable, provided that there is adequate supporting information to show that the transects represent the spatial extent and magnitude of effects, considering the tenure's currents regimes.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>For each transect place at least 5 macrofauna quadrats at each of these stations: perimeter of containment structure or array, 30 metres from the zero metre stations and on the perimeter of the tenure.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>At least 2 reference stations must be surveyed, with one transect at least 100 metres long at each. These must be the same reference stations as those surveyed during baseline inventory, or for existing sites, established for the Interim Monitoring Program 2000. In the absence of established sites documentation must be provided to show the reference sites meet the criteria in Section 2 B of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002).</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Data analyses must be performed according to the statistical protocols described in Section 7 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002) to determine whether the facility has had any statistically significant effects.</lefttext>
          <centertext>
            <strong>Part II — Sediment Sampling</strong>
          </centertext>
          <lefttext>Sediment sampling also requires a transect approach. Each transect must start at the perimeter of the containment structure, or containment structure array, and extend along the dominant currents to the perimeter of the tenure. There must be one transect for each of 2 dominant current directions for each containment structure or array. If adjacent containment structures, or arrays, are less than 60 m apart, they must be treated as if they were a single array when transects are positioned. A transect must not extend beneath an adjacent containment structure or array.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Each transect must have sampling stations located at the perimeter of the containment structure at 30 metres from the zero metre station and at the tenure perimeter. A zero metre station must be established for each transect. Each 30 metre station must be located along the dominant current using DGPS.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Alternate transect designs might be acceptable, provided that there is adequate supporting information to show that the transects represent the spatial extent and magnitude of effects, considering the tenure's currents regime(s). Two or more reference stations must be sampled at the same locations as those surveyed for baseline inventory, or for existing sites, established for the Interim Monitoring Program 2000. In the absence of established sites documentation must be provided to show the reference sites meet the criteria in Section 2 B of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002).</lefttext>
          <lefttext>The following physical and chemical parameters must be measured at the perimeter of containment structures, or of containment structure arrays and at reference stations during operational monitoring:</lefttext>
          <indent1>• free sulphides<footnoteref>2</footnoteref></indent1>
          <indent1>• redox potential<footnoteref>2</footnoteref></indent1>
          <indent1>• total volatile solids or total organic carbon</indent1>

          <lefttext>Free sulphide and redox potential monitoring must be also conducted at stations at 30 metres from the zero metre station, and at the perimeter of the tenure.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>A minimum of 3 grab samples must be taken at each station. If the mean free sulphide concentration of the 3 grabs at a given facility station exceeds a requirement or standard (not statistically), then 2 additional grabs must be taken for sulphides and redox potential.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Where biological sediment samples are needed, the abundance of infauna and epifauna must be quantified. Within the tenure, at least 5 sediment grabs are needed for each station. At each reference station, at least 3 grabs are needed. Biota must be taxonomically identified to at least the level of family. Also identify individuals of Capitella. After processing, samples must be archived for at least 5 years. These samples need to be properly stored and maintained.</lefttext>
          <lefttext>Perform data analyses according to the protocols described in Section 7 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002) to determine whether the facility has had any statistically significant effects.</lefttext>
