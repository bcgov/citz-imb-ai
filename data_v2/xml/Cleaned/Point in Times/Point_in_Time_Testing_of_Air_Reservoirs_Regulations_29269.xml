          <indent1>(3) Notwithstanding the requirements of drilling air reservoirs and hydrostatic testing of air reservoirs by the railway company, an inspecting engineer from the Ministry of Transportation and Highways may, at any time, require a hydrostatic test be applied in his presence to prove the soundness and strength of any pressure vessel.</indent1>
          <indent1>(4) Section 129 (4) and section 161 (4) of Part III, Locomotives Regulations (B.C. Reg. 454/59) shall not apply where air reservoirs have been drilled in accordance with the requirements of the Railway Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission's General Orders R-6562 and R-6563, hereby adopted.</indent1>
