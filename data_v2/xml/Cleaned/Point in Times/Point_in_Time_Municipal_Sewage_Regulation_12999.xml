            </centertext>
            <lefttext>1 The type of reclaimed water use permitted must be one of those indicated on this Schedule. Other proposed types of reclaimed water use will be assessed by the director on an individual basis and must, in consultation with the Ministry of Health Services, be approved in writing by the director.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>2 Reliability must be provided for all treatment processes as set out in Schedule 7. Emergency storage must satisfy the requirements of section 10 of this regulation.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>3 Effluent quality limits must be calculated as running mean values and apply to the reclaimed water at the point of discharge from the treatment facility or, if storage is provided, at the point of distribution or use.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>4 Sixty day storage after secondary treatment is acceptable in lieu of filtration provided the final effluent quality requirements are met and the discharger demonstrates to the satisfaction of a director that no short circuiting is occurring or likely to occur and that no viruses at levels of concern to local health authorities are detected in the reclaimed water.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>5 Subject to Note 1 Appendix 1 to Schedule 6, these requirements take precedence over the requirements of Schedule 6.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>6 Remote areas of parks, school grounds during vacation periods, and golf courses may be considered under the restricted public access category, provided: a minimum of 60 days storage is provided; the discharger demonstrates to the satisfaction of a director that access is controlled, that environmental concerns are addressed and that any concerns of the local health authorities are resolved; and, the director, in consultation with the local health authorities, approves the use in writing.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>7 Secondary treatment as defined by section 1 of this regulation.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>8 Chemical addition includes coagulant or polymer prior to filtration. Use is restricted to those coagulants and polymers shown to be non-toxic.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>9 For distribution of reclaimed water, the discharger must ensure that minimum total chlorine residual of 0.5 mg/L is maintained at the point of initial use. This requirement may be waived by a director, provided the discharger demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the director and local health authorities, that fecal coliforms remain below levels prescribed by this Schedule at the point of use and that the users are adequately informed regarding appropriate use of the reclaimed water.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>10 Turbidity limit must be met prior to disinfection. The average turbidity must be based on a 24-hour time period. The turbidity must not exceed 5 NTU at any time. If TSS is used in lieu of turbidity, the average TSS must not exceed 5 mg/L.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>11 The median value, as determined from the bacteriological results of the last 7 samples for which analyses have been completed, must not exceed the coliform limits specified.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>12 For unrestricted public access use, the number of fecal coliform organisms must not exceed 14/100 mL in any sample.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>13 The reclaimed water provider must demonstrate that reclaimed water does not contain pathogens or parasites at levels which are a concern to local health authorities. Reclaimed water must be clean, odourless, non-irritating to skin and eyes and must contain no substances that are toxic on ingestion.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>14 Where available agricultural (crop) limits must govern criteria for metals. High nutrient levels may adversely affect some crops during certain growth stages. Crop limits and season must govern nutrient application.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>15 The reclaimed water provider must obtain monitoring results, and confirm that water quality requirements are met, prior to distribution.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>16 Based on an initial 60 days of compliance with the quality limit, the discharger must conduct weekly presence or absence testing for coliform monitoring. If presence of any coliform is detected daily fecal coliform testing must be reinstated until the quality limit is in compliance. Fourteen tests must be conducted to demonstrate that the discharge is back in compliance and then weekly presence/absence testing must be resumed.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>17 Discharger must consult with the ministry of the minister responsible for the administration of the <actname>Ministry of Agriculture and Food Act</actname> regarding the difference between spraying for frost protection and spring frost protection techniques.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>18 If chlorine is used as a disinfectant then dechlorination is necessary to protect aquatic species of flora and fauna. The use of alternative disinfection methods is recommended. Possible effects on groundwater must be evaluated. Receiving water quality requirements may necessitate additional treatment. The temperature of the reclaimed water must not adversely affect the ecosystem. Nutrient removal may be necessary to limit algae growth in impoundments.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>19 Commercially processed food crops are those that, prior to sale to the public or others, have undergone chemical or physical processing such as, but not limited to, canning, heat treatment, fermentation and pickling, sufficient to destroy pathogens.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>20 Milking animals must be prohibited from grazing for 6 days after irrigation ceases. Other cattle must be prohibited from grazing for 3 days after irrigation ceases unless the meat is inspected under the Federal Meat Inspection Program.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>21 For restricted public access use, the number of fecal coliform organisms must not exceed 800/100 mL in any sample.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>22 Worker contact with reclaimed water must be minimized. A higher level of disinfection to achieve the number of fecal coliform organisms &lt; 14/100 mL must be provided where frequent worker contact with reclaimed water is likely.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>23 Setback distance to potable water well must be &gt; 30 m. A provider of reclaimed water must ensure that windblown spray will not exceed the boundaries of the property to which the reclaimed water is being applied and that windblown spray must not reach areas accessible to the public.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>24 A provider of reclaimed water must consult specific industry's recommended water quality limits for make-up water.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>25 Notwithstanding note 21, for wetlands where no diving, swimming, or wading activities occur, the number of fecal coliform organisms must not exceed 1 000/100 mL as determined in accordance with note 11 to this Appendix and the number of fecal coliform organisms must not exceed 4 000/100 mL in any sample.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>26 For lagoon systems, the maximum TSS level must not exceed 60 mg/L.</lefttext>

              <strong>Explanatory Notes</strong>
            </centertext>
            <lefttext>1 Effluent quality standards for all receiving water discharges are based on the use of an outfall which provides a combination of depth and distance to produce a minimum 10:1 initial dilution within the initial dilution zone.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>2 For estuaries, the stream flow is the fresh water content.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>3 If the dilution ratio is less than 100:1 the environmental impact study must determine if effluent quality needs to be better than that shown in Schedule 3. If the dilution ratio is below 40:1 and the receiving stream is used for recreational or domestic water extraction within the influence of the discharge or for seasonal discharge, discharge is not authorized unless an environmental impact study shows that the discharge is acceptable, and, in the opinion of a director, no other solutions are available and written authorization from the director is obtained. For seasonal discharges or where the receiving stream is not used for recreational or domestic water extraction, the director may in writing authorize a minimum dilution ratio of 20:1 for column A. Discharge is prohibited if the dilution ratio is less than 10:1.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>4 Treatment and effluent quality requirements are determined by daily flow multiples which require secondary treatment for all flows up to and equaling 2.0 times the ADWF. As set out in condition 17 to Schedule 1, a liquid waste management plan or specific study and implemented measures are required if flows exceed 2.0 times ADWF during a storm or equivalent snowmelt event with a less than 5-year return period. In the interim, if flows exceed 2.0 times ADWF, a lesser standard of treatment may be allowed for existing discharges, but must not be less than primary. For areas of the province where permafrost or freezing ground conditions require, in accordance with a practice approved by the local building inspector or equivalent, connection of roof drains to the sanitary sewer system, a director may, in writing, increase the factor from 2.0 times to a maximum of 3.0 times.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>5 All outfalls must be marked on shore with an appropriate sign. Information required is the length and depth of the outfall. The minimum size of the sign is 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> and the colours of the lettering and the background must contrast sufficiently with each other that the wording is clearly visible. The sign must be visible from both water and land. The wording on the sign must be to the satisfaction of a director.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>6 The discharger must also ensure that requirements of Schedule 5 are met, if applicable.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>7 See requirements of Schedule 5.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>8 The allowable number of fecal coliform organisms in the effluent is dependent on the use of the receiving water. For discharges to shellfish bearing waters the number of fecal coliform organisms at the edge of the initial dilution zone must be less than 14/100 mL ("the median number of fecal coliform organisms in a water sample does not exceed 14/100 mL, with not more than 10% of the samples exceeding 43/100 mL", from "Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program, Manual of Operations"). For discharges to recreational use waters the number of fecal coliform organisms at the edge of the initial dilution zone must be less than 200/100 mL. Where domestic water extraction occurs within 300 meters of a discharge the median number of fecal coliform organisms must be less than 2.2/100 mL in the effluent with no sample exceeding 14/100 mL. The geometric mean, as determined from the bacteriological results of the last 5 samples for which analyses have been completed over the last 30 days, must not exceed the coliform limits specified, and for this purpose, <term>geometric mean</term> means the anti-logarithm of a calculation in which the logarithms of a series of numerical measures are summed and divided by the number of numerical measures.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>9 Septic tank treatment requires a hydraulic capacity of at least 2 days minimum detention time at the design maximum daily flow. An effluent filter, screen or equivalent measures to protect pumps and prevent discharge of solids and floatables is required. For small, remote, seasonal discharges a director may waive the requirement for an effluent filter.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>10 The total and ortho phosphorus criteria may be waived, by a director in writing, if it can be shown by an environmental impact study that receiving waters would not be subject to an undesirable degree of increased biological activity because of the phosphorus addition. Alternatively, an environmental impact study may show that lower effluent concentrations than are tabulated are necessary, or that a mass load criteria may be needed.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>11 If required to satisfy section 8 of this regulation.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>12 The maximum allowable effluent ammonia concentration at the "end of pipe" must be determined from a back calculation from the edge of the initial dilution zone. The back calculation must consider the ambient temperature and pH characteristics of the receiving water and known water quality guidelines.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>13 For lagoon systems, the maximum TSS level must not exceed 60 mg/L.</lefttext>

            <lefttext>1 The discharger must ensure that requirements of Schedule 5 are met, if applicable.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>2 Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 305/2007, s. 11 (b).]</lefttext>
            <lefttext>3 The use of a drainfield in this category requires filtration to prevent solids carrying over into the disposal field. Monitoring controls must be maintained to signal an alarm when filtration begins to malfunction.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>4 Use of chamber distribution systems with equivalent length are permissible. The bottom of the sidewall or "foot" of the chamber is considered to be the trench bottom.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>5 Measured from the trench bottom to the highest water table including the groundwater mounding effect or restrictive layer where, in this note and note 7 of this Appendix, <term>groundwater mounding effect</term> means the vertical rise in the water table that occurs in response to a discharge.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>6 For flows equal to or greater than 37 m<sup>3</sup>/d only, and if water conservation measures are employed and a restrictive covenant is placed on each property requiring that water conservation measures are continuously employed, actual maximum daily flow may be used to design the treatment works and the disposal system. Notwithstanding Schedule 6 flow monitoring requirements, if actual maximum daily flow is used, daily discharge volume monitoring is required.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>7 For discharges equal to or greater than 37 m<sup>3</sup>/d only, if the soils are well drained and if the depth to groundwater including any groundwater mounding effect is greater than 1.0 m below the bottom of the drainage trench, a qualified professional may design the ground disposal system with deeper narrower trenches and the drainage pipe length may be reduced to a value equal to the product of Table 4 pipe length and a factor of 1/H<sup>0.5</sup> or 0.8 (whichever factor is greater), where H is the drainage trench depth below pipe invert in metres.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>8 Percolation rates less than 2 minutes per 25 mm are too fast for adequate renovation and drainfields will not be permitted, unless hydrogeological studies show that local groundwater quality can be met at the property boundary. For discharges of less than 37 m<sup>3</sup>/d only, use of AMERICAN SOCIETY OF TESTING MATERIALS C33 sand mounding or AMERICAN SOCIETY OF TESTING MATERIALS C33 sand-filled trenches to reduce percolation is permitted if Class B or A effluent is discharged by pressure distribution.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>9 Percolation rates more than 20 minutes per 25 mm require the construction to be supervised by a qualified professional to have been carried out in a manner which has not reduced the trench wall permeability unless, for discharges less than 37 m<sup>3</sup>/d only, the native undisturbed permeable soil depth exceeds 1.35 m.</lefttext>
            <lefttext>10 For lagoon systems, the maximum TSS level must not exceed 60 mg/L.</lefttext>
