      <bcl:lefttext>I,........................................, am an enforcement officer and a qualified operator of the prescribed speed monitoring device described in this certificate. On ..........(date).........., between .......... hours and .......... hours, I was operating, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a .................................................., a prescribed speed monitoring device capable of photographing motor vehicles while accurately and simultaneously measuring and recording their speed. For the purpose of enforcing section <in:strong>146 (1) </in:strong>of the <in:doc>Motor Vehicle Act</in:doc>, the prescribed speed monitoring device photographed the ........(front/rear)........ licence plate of motor vehicles ..........(approaching/receding from).......... the device, while accurately and simultaneously measuring and recording their speed as they travelled approximately ..........(direction).......... on a highway, namely ........................................, approximately ..............................(location on highway).............................. ................(at/near)............... ...............(city, place, or town)............... in the Province of British Columbia, which location was assigned a unique deployment site code.......... .</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The prescribed speed monitoring device was tested by me, in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, immediately prior to .......... hours and immediately after .......... hours, on that date and at that location, and I found it to be in proper working order. This prescribed speed monitoring device photographed motor vehicles while accurately and simultaneously measuring and recording their speed at that location and during those hours of operation, using Film Roll Number .......... . Each film roll is assigned a unique number and included in that film roll are photograph frames listed in numerical sequence.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The device photographs the motor vehicle on the film while accurately and simultaneously recording the following data on the data line at the bottom of the image, indicating from left to right: a single letter from A to P used as an image control character, followed by the film roll number, followed by the photograph frame number; the date the photograph was taken (year:month:day); the time the photograph was taken (hour:minute:second), followed by a single letter from A to Z confirming a successful internal check of the device, followed by either a plus (+) sign indicating the photographed motor vehicle was approaching the speed monitoring device, or a minus (−) sign indicating the photographed motor vehicle was receding from the speed monitoring device, followed by the photographed motor vehicle's speed indicated in kilometres per hour (km/h); and the unique deployment site code where the photograph was taken, followed by the qualified operator's identification number. On that date, the speed limit at that location was 50 kilometres per hour (km/h) and there were no signs in place otherwise governing the speed limit.
