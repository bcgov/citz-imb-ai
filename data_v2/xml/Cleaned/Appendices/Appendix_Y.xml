          Disagreement</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFINITIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>1. In this Appendix:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) <in:strong>"Chapter"</in:strong> means Chapter 25 Dispute
        Resolution;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) <in:strong>"Notice Issuer"</in:strong> means a Party that has given notice in
        accordance with 25.5.1, 25.6.1 or 25.9.1 of the Chapter; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) <in:strong>"Notice Recipient"</in:strong> means the Party providing the
        written reply in accordance with paragraph 2.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>2. A Party who is identified in a notice under 25.5.1, 25.6.1 or 25.9.1 of the
        Chapter as being directly engaged in a Disagreement may dispute whether it is directly
        engaged in a Disagreement by providing the other Parties with a written reply to the notice
        in accordance with paragraph 3, failing which that Party is deemed to be directly engaged in
        the Disagreement in accordance with 25.1.2 of the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>3. The written reply contemplated by paragraph 2 will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) include the reasons why the Notice Recipient does not consider itself to be
        directly engaged in the Disagreement; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) be delivered to the other Parties within 10 days of the receipt of the
        notice.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>4. Within 10 days of the receipt of a reply in accordance with paragraph 2, any
        Party may, by sending a notice of summary arbitration in accordance with paragraph 5, refer
        the question of whether the Notice Recipient is directly engaged in the Disagreement for
        summary determination by a single arbitrator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>5. If no Party sends a notice of summary arbitration in accordance with paragraph
        4, the Notice Issuer is deemed not to be directly engaged in the Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>6. A notice of summary arbitration will be in writing and include the
        following:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) a brief summary of the particulars of the dispute; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the suggested name of an arbitrator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>7. Any Party other than the Notice Issuer and the Notice Recipient may
        participate in the summary arbitration process by giving written notice to the other Parties
        within 15 days of delivery of a notice of summary arbitration.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>8. If the Participating Parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within 30 days
        after a notice of summary arbitration has been received, the appointment will be made by the
        Neutral Appointing Authority.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>9. The Participating Parties will provide to the arbitrator, written submissions
        according to the following schedule:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) Submission by the Notice Recipient — seven days following appointment of the
        arbitrator;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) Submission by the Notice Issuer — 10 days following the filing of the
        Submission by the Notice Recipient;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) Submission by the other Participating Parties — seven days following the
        Submission by the Notice Issuer;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) Reply of the Notice Recipient — seven days following the Submission of the
        other Participating Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>10. All submissions will be provided to the other Participating Parties at the
        same time that they are submitted to the arbitrator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>11. The arbitrator will consider the material submitted by the Participating
        Parties, without convening an oral proceeding, and will decide the issue described in the
        notice of summary arbitration within seven days after either the submission of the last
        material or the expiration of the last date prescribed for the submission of material,
        whichever event occurs first.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>12. The decision of the arbitrator contemplated by paragraph 11 will be in the
        form of a written document and will be final and binding on all Parties and will not be
        subject to any proceedings by way of appeal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:centertext><in:strong><in:a name="appY-2"/>Appendix Y-2<in:br/>Collaborative Negotiations</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFINITIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>1.

        Resolution.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GENERAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>2. Collaborative negotiations commence:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) on the date of delivery of a written notice requiring the commencement of
        collaborative negotiations; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) in the case of negotiations in the circumstances described in 25.2.2 c. of the
        Chapter, on the date of the first negotiation meeting.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>NOTICE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>3. A notice under 25.5.1 of the Chapter requiring the commencement of
        collaborative negotiations will include the following:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the names of the Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) a summary of the particulars of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) a description of the efforts made to date to resolve the
        Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the names of the individuals involved in those efforts; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) any other information that will help the Participating Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REPRESENTATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>4. A Participating Party may attend collaborative negotiations with or without
        legal counsel or other advisors.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>5. At the commencement of the first negotiation meeting, each Participating Party
        will advise the other Participating Parties of any limitations on the authority of its
        representatives.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>NEGOTIATION PROCESS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>6. The Participating Parties will convene their first negotiation meeting in
        collaborative negotiations, other than those described in 25.2.2 c. of the Chapter, within
        21 days after the commencement of the collaborative negotiations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>7. Before the first scheduled negotiation meeting, the Participating Parties will
        attempt to agree on any procedural issues that will facilitate the collaborative
        negotiations, including the requirements of 25.7.1 of the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>8. For purposes of 25.7.1 a. of the Chapter, "timely disclosure" means disclosure
        made within 15 days after a request for disclosure by a Participating Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>9. The Participating Parties will make a serious attempt to resolve the
        Disagreement by:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) identifying underlying interests;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) isolating points of agreement and disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) exploring alternative solutions;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) considering compromises or accommodations; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) taking any other measures that will assist in resolution of the
        Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>10. No transcript or recording will be kept of collaborative negotiations, but
        this does not prevent an individual from keeping notes of the negotiations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>11. In order to assist in the resolution of a Disagreement, collaborative
        negotiations will not be open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>12. The Parties, and all persons, will keep confidential:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) all oral and written information disclosed in the collaborative negotiations;
        and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the fact that the information has been disclosed.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>13. The Parties will not rely on or introduce as evidence in any proceeding,
        whether or not that proceeding relates to the subject matter of the collaborative
        negotiations, any oral or written information disclosed in or arising from the collaborative
        negotiations, including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) any documents of other Parties produced in the course of the collaborative
        negotiations that are not otherwise produced or producible in that proceeding;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) any views expressed, or suggestions made, by any Party in respect of a
        possible settlement of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) any admissions made by any Party in the course of the collaborative
        negotiations, unless otherwise stipulated by the admitting Party; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the fact that any Party has indicated a willingness to make or accept a
        proposal for settlement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>14. Paragraphs 12 and 13 do not apply:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) in any proceeding for the enforcement or setting aside of an agreement
        resolving the Disagreement that was the subject of the collaborative
        negotiation;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) if the adjudicator in any proceeding determines that the interests of the
        public or the administration of justice outweigh the need for confidentiality;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) if the oral or written information referred to in paragraphs 12 and 13 is in
        the public forum.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>15. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 13 precludes a Party from relying
        on or introducing as evidence in any proceeding any documents that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) are produced by that Party in the course of the collaborative negotiations;
        and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) are otherwise producible.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>RIGHT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>16. A Participating Party may withdraw from collaborative negotiations at any
        time.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF COLLABORATIVE NEGOTIATIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>17. Collaborative negotiations are terminated when any of the following
        occurs:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the expiration of:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) 30 days; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) in the case of collaborative negotiations in the circumstances described in
        25.2.2 c. of the Chapter, 120 days after the first scheduled negotiation meeting, or any
        longer period agreed to by the Participating Parties in writing;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b) a Participating Party directly engaged in the Disagreement withdraws from the
        collaborative negotiations under paragraph 16;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the Participating Parties agree in writing to terminate the collaborative
        negotiations; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the Participating Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement sign a written
        agreement resolving the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:centertext><in:strong><in:a name="appY-3"/>Appendix Y-3<in:br/>Mediation</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFINITIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>1. In this Appendix <in:strong>"Chapter"</in:strong> means Chapter 25 Dispute
        Resolution.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GENERAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>2. A mediation commences on the date the Parties directly engaged in the
        Disagreement have agreed to use mediation, or are deemed to have agreed to use mediation, in
        accordance with 25.6.5 of the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPOINTMENT OF MEDIATOR</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>3. A mediation will be conducted by one mediator jointly appointed by the
        Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>4. A mediator will be:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) an experienced and skilled mediator, preferably with unique qualities or
        specialized knowledge that would be of assistance in the circumstances of the Disagreement;
        and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) independent and impartial.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>5. If the Participating Parties fail to agree on a mediator within 15 days after
        commencement of a mediation, the appointment will be made by the Neutral Appointing
        Authority on the written request of a Participating Party that is copied to the other
        Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>6. Subject to any limitations agreed to by the Participating Parties, a mediator
        may employ reasonable and necessary administrative or other support services.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REQUIREMENT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>7. At any time a Participating Party may give the mediator and the other
        Participating Parties a written notice, with or without reasons, requiring the mediator to
        withdraw from the mediation on the grounds that the Participating Party has justifiable
        doubts as to the mediator's independence or impartiality.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>8. On receipt of a written notice in accordance with paragraph 7, the mediator
        will immediately withdraw from the mediation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>9. An individual who is Maa‑nulth‑aht or a Maa‑nulth First Nation Citizen, or
        related to Maa‑nulth‑aht or a Maa‑nulth First Nation Citizen, will not be required to
        withdraw in accordance with paragraph 7 solely on the grounds of that citizenship or
        relationship.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>END OF APPOINTMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>10. A mediator's appointment terminates if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the mediator is required to withdraw in accordance with paragraph
        8;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the mediator withdraws from office for any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the Participating Parties agree to the termination.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>11. If a mediator's appointment terminates, a replacement mediator will be
        appointed in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 5 within the required time commencing from the
        date of the termination of the appointment.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REPRESENTATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>12. A Participating Party may attend a mediation with or without legal counsel or
        other advisor.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>13. If a mediator is a lawyer, the mediator will not act as legal counsel for any
        Participating Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>14. At the commencement of the first meeting of a mediation, each Participating
        Party will advise the mediator and the other Participating Parties of any limitations on the
        authority of its representatives.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONDUCT OF MEDIATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>15. The Participating Parties will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) make a serious attempt to resolve the Disagreement by:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) identifying underlying interests;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) isolating points of agreement and disagreement;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii) exploring alternative solutions; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iv) considering compromises or accommodations; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b) cooperate fully with the mediator and give prompt attention to, and respond
        to, all communications from the mediator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>16. A mediator may conduct a mediation in any manner the mediator considers
        necessary and appropriate to assist the Participating Parties to resolve the Disagreement in
        a fair, efficient and cost-effective manner.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>17. Within seven days of appointment of a mediator, each Participating Party will
        deliver a written summary to the mediator of the relevant facts, the issues in the
        Disagreement, and its viewpoint in respect of them and the mediator will deliver copies of
        the summaries to each Participating Party at the end of the seven day period.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>18. A mediator may conduct a mediation in joint meetings or private caucus
        convened at locations the mediator designates after consulting the Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>19. Disclosures made by any Participating Party to a mediator in private caucus
        will not be disclosed by the mediator to any other Participating Party without the consent
        of the disclosing Participating Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>20. No transcript or recording will be kept of a mediation meeting but this does
        not prevent a person from keeping notes of the negotiations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>21. In order to assist in the resolution of a Disagreement, a mediation will not
        be open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>22. The Parties, and all persons, will keep confidential:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) all oral and written information disclosed in the mediation; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the fact that this information has been disclosed.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>23. The Parties will not rely on or introduce as evidence in any proceeding,
        whether or not that proceeding relates to the subject matter of the mediation, any oral or
        written information disclosed in or arising from the mediation, including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) any documents of other Parties produced in the course of the mediation that
        are not otherwise produced or producible in that proceeding;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) any views expressed, or suggestions, or proposals made in respect of a
        possible settlement of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) any admissions made by any Party in the course of the mediation, unless
        otherwise stipulated by the admitting Party;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) any recommendations for settlement made by the mediator; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) the fact that any Party has indicated a willingness to make or accept a
        proposal or recommendation for settlement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>24. Paragraphs 22 and 23 do not apply:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) in any proceeding for the enforcement or setting aside of an agreement
        resolving the Disagreement that was the subject of a mediation;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) if the adjudicator in any proceeding determines that the interests of public
        or the administration of justice outweigh the need for confidentiality; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) if the oral or written information referred to in paragraphs 22 and 23 is in
        the public forum.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>25. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 23 precludes a Party from relying
        on or introducing as evidence in any proceeding any documents that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) are produced by that Party in the course of mediation; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) are otherwise producible.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>26. A mediator, or anyone retained or employed by the mediator, is not
        compellable in any proceeding to give evidence about any oral and written information
        acquired or opinion formed by that person as a result of the mediation, and all Parties will
        oppose any effort to have that person or that information subpoenaed.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>27. A mediator, or anyone retained or employed by the mediator, is disqualified
        as a consultant or expert in any proceeding relating to the Disagreement, including any
        proceeding that involves persons not a Participating Party to the mediation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REFERRAL OF ISSUES TO OTHER PROCESSES</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>28. During a mediation the Participating Parties may agree to refer particular
        issues in the Disagreement to independent fact-finders, expert panels or other processes for
        opinions or findings that may assist them in the resolution of the Disagreement, and in that
        event, the Participating Parties will specify:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the terms of reference for the process;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the time within which the process will be concluded; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) how the costs of the process are to be allocated to the Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>29. The time specified for concluding a mediation will be extended for 15 days
        following receipt of the findings or opinions rendered in a process described in paragraph
        28.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>RIGHT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>30. A Participating Party may withdraw from a mediation at any time by giving
        written notice of its intent to the mediator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>31. Before a withdrawal is effective, the withdrawing Participating Party
        will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) speak with the mediator;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) disclose its reasons for withdrawing; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) give the mediator the opportunity to discuss the consequences of
        withdrawal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF MEDIATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>32. A mediation is terminated when any of the following occurs:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) subject to paragraph 29, the expiration of 30 days after the appointment of
        the last mediator appointed to assist the Parties in resolving the Disagreement, or any
        longer period agreed by the Participating Parties in writing;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the Participating Parties have agreed in writing to terminate the mediation or
        not to appoint a replacement mediator in accordance with paragraph 11;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) a Participating Party directly engaged in the Disagreement withdraws from the

        agreement resolving the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>MEDIATOR RECOMMENDATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>33. If a mediation is terminated without the Parties who are directly engaged in
        the Disagreement reaching agreement, the Parties who are directly engaged in the
        Disagreement may agree to request the mediator to give a written non-binding recommendation
        for settlement, but the mediator may decline the request without reasons.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>34. Within 15 days after delivery of a mediator's recommendation in accordance
        with paragraph 33, the Participating Parties will meet with the mediator to attempt to
        resolve the Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COSTS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>35. A Participating Party withdrawing from a mediation in accordance with
        paragraph 30 is not responsible for any costs of the mediation that are incurred after the

        Panel.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GENERAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>2. A question of law may not be referred to a Panel.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>3. A Reference commences on the date the Parties directly engaged in the
        Disagreement have agreed in writing to use a Panel in accordance with 25.6.5 of the
        Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPOINTMENT OF PANEL MEMBERS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>4. A Panel will have three Members unless the Participating Parties agree on a
        Panel of five Members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>5. A Member will be skilled and knowledgeable in the technical or scientific
        subject matter or issues of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>6. If there are two Participating Parties and the Panel will have:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) three Members, each Participating Party will appoint one Member and the two
        appointed Members will jointly appoint the third Member; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) five Members, each Participating Party will appoint two Members and the four
        appointed Members will jointly appoint the fifth Member.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>7. If there are three Participating Parties and the Panel will
        have:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) three Members, each Participating Party will appoint one Member;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) five Members, each Participating Party will appoint one Member and the three
        appointed Members will jointly appoint the fourth and fifth Members.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>8. In the appointment procedures contemplated by paragraphs 6 and 7,
        if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) a Participating Party fails to appoint the required number of Members within
        30 days after commencement of the Reference; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the appointing Members fail to appoint the required number of additional
        Members within 15 days after the last appointing Member was appointed,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the required appointments will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority on the
        written request of a Participating Party that is copied to the other Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>END OF APPOINTMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>9. The appointment of a Member who is jointly appointed by the Participating
        Parties, by the appointing Members or by the Neutral Appointing Authority, terminates
        if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Member withdraws from office for any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the Participating Parties agree to the termination.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>10. The appointment of a Member appointed by one Participating Party, or by the
        Neutral Appointing Authority in place of the Participating Party, terminates
        if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Member withdraws from, or is unable to perform the duties of, office for
        any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the appointing Participating Party terminates the appointment.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>11. If the appointment of a Member jointly appointed by the Participating
        Parties, by the appointing Members, or by the Neutral Appointing Authority in place of the
        Participating Parties or Members, terminates, a replacement Member will be appointed in
        accordance with paragraph 6 or 7, as applicable, within the required time commencing from
        the termination of the former Member's appointment.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>12. Subject to paragraph 13, if the appointment of a Member appointed by one
        Participating Party or by the Neutral Appointing Authority in place of the Participating
        Party terminates, a replacement Member will be appointed in accordance with paragraph 6 or
        7, as applicable, within the required time commencing from the termination of the former
        Member's appointment.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>13. A Participating Party may elect not to replace a Member it had appointed but
        the Participating Party may not withdraw from the Reference except as permitted in
        accordance with paragraphs 31 to 35.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMS OF REFERENCE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>14. Not more than 15 days after the appointment of the last Member of a Panel,
        the Participating Parties will provide the Panel with written terms of reference that set
        out at least the following:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Participating Parties to the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the subject matter or issues of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the kind of assistance that the Participating Parties request from the Panel,
        including giving advice, making determinations, finding facts, conducting, evaluating and
        reporting on studies and making recommendations;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the time period within which the Participating Parties request the assistance
        to be provided;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) the time periods or stages of the Reference at the conclusion of which the
        Panel will provide the Participating Parties with written interim reports on the Panel's
        progress on the referral and on expenditures in the budget contemplated by paragraph 16 as
        they relate to that progress;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>f) the time within which the Panel will provide the Parties with the budget
        contemplated by paragraph 16; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>g) any limitations on the application of paragraphs 36 to 42 to the
        Reference.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>15. The Participating Parties may discuss the proposed terms of reference with
        the Panel before they are finally settled.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>16. Within the time referred to in paragraph 14 f), the Panel will provide the
        Participating Parties with a budget for the costs of conducting the Reference,
        including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) fees to be paid to the Members who have been jointly appointed by the
        Participating Parties, by appointing Members, or by the Neutral Appointing
        Authority;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) costs of required travel, food and accommodation of Members who have been
        jointly appointed by the Participating Parties, by appointing Members or by the Neutral
        Appointing Authority;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) costs of any required administrative assistance; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) costs of any studies.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>17. The Participating Parties will consider the budget submitted by the Panel and
        approve that budget with any amendments agreed by the Participating Parties before the Panel
        undertakes any activities under the Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>18. The Participating Parties are not responsible for any costs incurred by the
        Panel that are in excess of those approved in accordance with paragraph 17, and the Panel is
        not authorized to incur any costs beyond that amount without obtaining prior written
        approval from all the Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>19. The Participating Parties may amend the written terms of Reference or the
        budget from time to time as they consider necessary, or on recommendation of the
        Panel.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONDUCT OF REFERENCE TO PANEL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>20. The Participating Parties will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) cooperate fully with the Panel;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) comply with any requests made by the Panel as permitted or required in this
        Appendix; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) give prompt attention to and respond to all communications from the
        Panel.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>21. Subject to any limitations or requirements in the terms of Reference given
        and the limits of the budget approved in accordance with paragraphs 17 to 19, the Panel may
        conduct its Reference using any procedure it considers necessary or appropriate, including
        holding a hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>22. If a hearing is held, the hearing will be conducted as efficiently as
        possible and in the manner the Panel specifies, after consultation with the Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>23. If a hearing is held, the Panel will give the Parties reasonable written
        notice of the hearing date, which notice will, in any event, be not less than seven
        days.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>24. No transcript or recording will be kept of a hearing, but this does not
        prevent an individual attending the hearing from keeping notes of the hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>25. The legal rules of evidence do not apply to a hearing before the
        Panel.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>26. The Panel will give the Participating Parties the interim and final written
        reports specified in its terms of Reference within the required times.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>27. A report of the Panel is not binding on the Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>PANEL BUSINESS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>28. A Panel will appoint one of its Members to act as chair of the
        Panel.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>29. The chair of a Panel is responsible for all communications between the Panel,
        the Participating Parties and any other person to whom the Panel wishes to communicate, but
        this does not preclude a Member from communicating informally with a Participating
        Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>30. A Panel will make every reasonable effort to conduct its business, and
        fulfill its obligations in accordance with its terms of Reference, by consensus,
        but:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) if consensus is not possible, by actions approved by a majority of its
        Members; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) if a majority is not possible, by actions approved by the chair of the
        Panel.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>RIGHT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>31. If one of two Participating Parties to a Reference, or two of three
        Participating Parties to a Reference, are not satisfied with the progress of the
        Reference:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) after receipt of an interim report; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) as a result of the Panel's failure to submit an interim report within the
        required time,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the dissatisfied Participating Party or Participating Parties, as the case may
        be, may give written notice to the Panel and the other Participating Parties that the
        Participating Party or Participating Parties are withdrawing from the Reference and that the
        Reference is terminated.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>32. If one of three Participating Parties to a Reference is not satisfied with
        the progress of the Reference:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) after receipt of an interim report; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) as a result of the Panel's failure to submit an interim report within the
        required time,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the dissatisfied Participating Party may give written notice to the Panel and the
        other Participating Parties that it is withdrawing from the Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>33. Two Participating Parties who receive a notice in accordance with paragraph
        32 will advise the Panel in writing that they have agreed:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) to terminate the Reference; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) to continue the Reference.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>34. If no Participating Party gives a notice in accordance with paragraphs 31 or
        32 within 10 days after:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) receipt of an interim report; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the time required to submit an interim report,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>all Participating Parties will be deemed to be satisfied with the progress of the
        Reference until submission of the next required interim report.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>35. No Participating Party may withdraw from a Reference except as permitted in
        accordance with paragraph 31 to 34.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>36. The Participating Parties may, by agreement recorded in the terms of
        reference of the Panel in paragraph 14, limit the application of all or any part of
        paragraphs 37 to 42 in a Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>37. In order to assist in the resolution of the Disagreement, a Reference will
        not be open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>38. The Parties, and all persons, will keep confidential:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) all oral and written information disclosed in the Reference; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the fact that this information has been disclosed.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>39. The Parties will not rely on or introduce as evidence in any proceeding,
        whether or not that proceeding relates to the subject matter of the Reference, any oral or
        written information disclosed in or arising from the Reference, including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) any documents of other Parties produced in the course of the Reference that
        are not otherwise produced or producible in that proceeding;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) any views expressed, or suggestions made, in respect of a possible settlement
        of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) any admissions made by any Party in the course of the Reference, unless
        otherwise stipulated by the admitting Party;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the fact that any Party has indicated a willingness to make or accept a
        proposal or recommendation for settlement; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) any reports of the Panel.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>40. Paragraphs 38 and 39 do not apply:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) in any proceeding for the enforcement or setting aside of an agreement
        resolving the Disagreement that was the subject of the Reference;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) if the adjudicator in any proceeding determines that the interests of the
        public or the administration of justice outweigh the need for confidentiality;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) if the oral or written information referred to in those paragraphs is in the
        public forum.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>41. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 39 precludes a Party from relying
        on or introducing as evidence in any proceeding any documents that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) are produced by that Party in the Reference; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) are otherwise producible.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>42. A Member, or anyone retained or employed by the Member, is not compellable in
        any proceeding to give evidence about any oral or written information acquired or opinion
        formed by that person as a result of the Reference, and all Parties will oppose any effort
        to have that person or that information subpoenaed.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>43. A Member, or anyone retained or employed by the Member, is disqualified as a
        consultant or expert in any proceeding relating to the Disagreement, including any
        proceeding that involves persons not a Party to the Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE AFTER REPORT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>44. Within 21 days after receipt of the final written report of a Panel, the
        Participating Parties will meet and make an effort to resolve the Disagreement taking into
        account the report of the Panel or any other considerations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>45. If the Participating Parties and the Panel agree, the Members of a Panel may
        attend the meeting contemplated by paragraph 44, and provide any necessary assistance to the
        Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF REFERENCE TO PANEL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>46. A Reference is terminated when any of the following occurs:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Reference has been terminated as permitted in accordance with paragraph 31
        or 33;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the expiration of 30 days after receipt of the final report of the Panel, or
        any longer period agreed by the Participating Parties in writing; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the Participating Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement sign a written
        agreement resolving the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COSTS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>47. A Participating Party is not responsible for sharing any costs of the
        Reference that were incurred after the date that Participating Party notified the other
        Participating Parties, in accordance with paragraph 32, of its withdrawal from the
        Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:centertext><in:a name="appY-5"/><in:strong>Appendix Y-5<in:br/>Neutral Evaluation</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFINITION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>1. In this Appendix <in:strong>"Chapter"</in:strong> means Chapter 25 Dispute
        Resolution.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GENERAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>2. A neutral evaluation commences on the date that the Parties directly engaged
        in the Disagreement have agreed to use neutral evaluation in accordance with 25.6.5 of the
        Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPOINTMENT OF NEUTRAL EVALUATOR</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>3. A neutral evaluation will be conducted by one individual jointly appointed by
        the Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>4. A neutral evaluator will be:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) experienced or skilled in the subject matter or issues of the Disagreement;
        and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) independent and impartial.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>5. If the Participating Parties fail to agree on a neutral evaluator within 21
        days after commencement of a neutral evaluation, the appointment will be made by the Neutral
        Appointing Authority on the written request of a Participating Party that is copied to the
        other Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>6. Subject to any limitations agreed to by the Participating Parties, a neutral
        evaluator may employ reasonable and necessary administrative or other support
        services.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REQUIREMENT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>7. At any time a Participating Party may give a neutral evaluator and the other
        Participating Parties a written notice, with or without reasons, requiring the neutral
        evaluator to withdraw from the neutral evaluation on the grounds that the Participating
        Party has justifiable doubts as to the neutral evaluator's independence or
        impartiality.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>8. On receipt of a written notice in accordance with paragraph 7, the neutral
        evaluator will immediately withdraw from the neutral evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>9. An individual who is a Maa‑nulth‑aht or a Maa‑nulth First Nation Citizen, or
        related to a Maa‑nulth‑aht or Maa‑nulth First Nation Citizen, will not be required to
        withdraw in accordance with paragraph 7 solely on the grounds of that citizenship or
        relationship.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>END OF APPOINTMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>10. A neutral evaluator's appointment terminates if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the neutral evaluator is required to withdraw in accordance with
        paragraph 8;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the neutral evaluator withdraws from, or is unable to perform the duties of,
        office for any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the Participating Parties agree to the termination.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>11. If a neutral evaluator's appointment terminates, a replacement will be
        appointed in accordance with paragraph 5 within the required time commencing from the date
        of the termination of the appointment.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMMUNICATIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>12. Except with respect to administrative details or a meeting in accordance with
        paragraph 31, the Participating Parties will not communicate with the neutral
        evaluator:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) orally except in the presence of all Participating Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) in writing without immediately sending a copy of that communication to all
        Participating Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>13. Paragraph 12 also applies to any communication by a neutral evaluator to the
        Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONDUCT OF NEUTRAL EVALUATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>14. The Participating Parties will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) cooperate fully with the neutral evaluator;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) comply with any requests made by the neutral evaluator as permitted or
        required by this Appendix; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) give prompt attention to and respond to all communications from the neutral
        evaluator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>15. A neutral evaluation will be conducted only on the basis of documents
        submitted by the Parties in accordance with paragraph 20 unless the Participating Parties
        agree to, or the neutral evaluator requires, additional submissions or other forms of
        evidence.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>16. If a hearing is held, the hearing will be conducted as efficiently as
        possible and in the manner the neutral evaluator specifies, after consultation with the
        Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>17. If a hearing is held, the neutral evaluator will give the Participating
        Parties reasonable written notice of the hearing date, which notice will, in any event, be
        not less than seven days.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>18. No transcript or recording will be kept of a hearing, but this does not
        prevent an individual attending the hearing from keeping notes of the hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>19. The legal rules of evidence do not apply to a neutral
        evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>20. Within 15 days after the appointment of a neutral evaluator, each
        Participating Party will deliver to the other Participating Parties and to the neutral
        evaluator a written submission respecting the Disagreement, including facts upon which the
        Participating Parties agree or disagree, and copies of any documents, affidavits and
        exhibits on which the Participating Party relies.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>21. Within 21 days after the appointment of a neutral evaluator, a Participating
        Party may submit a reply to the submission of any other Participating Party and, in that
        event, will provide copies of the reply to the Participating Party and the neutral
        evaluator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>22. In order to assist in the resolution of the Disagreement, a neutral
        evaluation will not be open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>23. The Parties, and all persons, will keep confidential:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) all oral and written information disclosed in the neutral evaluation;
        and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the fact that this information has been disclosed.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>24. The Parties will not rely on or introduce as evidence in any proceeding,
        whether or not that proceeding relates to the subject matter of the neutral evaluation, any
        oral or written information disclosed in or arising from the neutral evaluation,
        including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) any documents of other Parties produced in the course of the neutral
        evaluation which are not otherwise produced or producible in that proceeding;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) any views expressed, or suggestions made, in respect of a possible settlement
        of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) any admissions made by any Party in the course of the neutral evaluation,
        unless otherwise stipulated by the admitting Party;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the fact that any Party has indicated a willingness to make or accept a
        proposal for settlement; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) subject to paragraph 28, the opinion of the neutral evaluator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>25. Paragraphs 23 and 24 do not apply:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) in any proceedings for the enforcement or setting aside of an agreement
        resolving the Disagreement that was the subject of a neutral evaluation;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) if the adjudicator in any proceeding determines that the interests of the
        public or the administration of justice outweigh the need for confidentiality;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) if the oral or written information is in the public forum.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>26. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 24 precludes a Party from relying
        on or introducing as evidence in any proceeding any documents that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) are produced by that Party in the course of the neutral evaluation;
        and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) are otherwise producible.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>27. A neutral evaluator, or anyone retained or employed by the neutral evaluator,
        is not compellable in any proceedings to give evidence about any oral and written
        information acquired or opinion formed by that person as a result of a neutral evaluation
        under this Appendix, and all Parties will oppose any effort to have that person or that
        information subpoenaed.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>28. A neutral evaluator and anyone retained or employed by the neutral evaluator
        is disqualified as a consultant or expert in any proceeding relating to the Disagreement,
        including any proceeding that involves persons not a Party to the neutral
        evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>29. Notwithstanding paragraphs 23 to 27, after an Arbitral Tribunal as defined in
        Appendix Y-6 has delivered its final Arbitral Award as defined in Appendix Y-6, or a court
        has referred its decision, in respect of a Disagreement, a Party, for the purpose only of
        making a submission on the allocation of costs of that arbitral or judicial proceeding, may
        give to the Arbitral Tribunal or the court a copy of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the neutral evaluator's opinion respecting that Disagreement; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the neutral evaluator's notice of termination in accordance with
        paragraph 7.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>NON-BINDING OPINION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>30. Within 21 days after the later of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) delivery of the last submission required or permitted in a neutral evaluation
        under this Appendix; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) completion of a hearing,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the neutral evaluator will deliver to the Participating Parties a written opinion
        with reasons in respect of the probable disposition of the Disagreement should it be
        submitted to arbitral or judicial proceedings, as the case may be, in accordance with the
        Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>31. An opinion contemplated by paragraph 30 is not binding on the
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE AFTER OPINION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>32. Within 21 days after delivery of an opinion contemplated by paragraph 30, the
        Parties will meet and make an effort to resolve the Disagreement, taking into account the
        opinion of the neutral evaluator or any other considerations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>33. If the Parties and the neutral evaluator agree, the neutral evaluator may
        attend a meeting contemplated by paragraph 32, and provide any necessary assistance to the
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>FAILURE TO COMPLY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>34. If a Participating Party fails to participate in the neutral evaluation as
        contemplated in paragraphs 14 to 21, the neutral evaluator may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) provide an opinion based solely upon the information and submissions they have
        obtained; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) give a written notice of termination of the neutral evaluation</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>and, in either event, the neutral evaluator will record that Participating
        Party's failure.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF NEUTRAL EVALUATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>35. A neutral evaluation is terminated when any of the following
        occurs:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the neutral evaluator gives a notice of termination in accordance with
        paragraph 34 b);</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the expiration of 30 days after receipt of an opinion in accordance with
        paragraphs 30 or 34, as the case may be, or any longer period agreed by the Participating
        Parties;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) all the Participating Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement agree in
        writing to terminate the evaluation; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) all the Participating Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement sign a
        written agreement resolving the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COSTS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>36. A Participating Party that has failed to participate in a neutral evaluation
        as contemplated in paragraphs 14 to 21 is responsible for its share of the costs of the
        neutral evaluation, despite its failure to participate.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>NEUTRAL EVALUATION — FEDERAL EXPROPRIATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>37. Where the matters referred to the neutral evaluator is an objection to a
        proposed expropriation of an Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands under 2.12.0, the
        following abridgement of time limits applies to the neutral evaluation process set out in
        this Appendix, unless the Participating Parties otherwise agree in writing:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. under paragraph 5, the Participating Parties must agree to a neutral evaluator
        within 7 days after the commencement of a neutral evaluation; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. under paragraph 16, if a hearing is held it must be held within 35 days of the
        commencement of a neutral evaluation.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>38. Where the matter referred to the neutral evaluator is an objection to a
        proposed expropriation of an Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands under 2.12.0,
        paragraphs 32, 33, 34 b) and 35 a) of this Appendix do not apply to the neutral
        evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>39. For greater certainty, a neutral evaluation concerning an objection by the
        Maa‑nulth First Nation to a proposed expropriation by a Federal Expropriating Authority of
        an Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands commences for the purposes of paragraph 2 of
        this Appendix on the day that notice in writing is received by the Federal Expropriating
        Authority.</bcl:indent1><bcl:centertext><in:a name="appY-6"/><in:strong>Appendix Y-6<in:br/>Arbitration</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFINITIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>1. In this Appendix:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) <in:strong>"Applicant"</in:strong> means:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) in an arbitration commenced in accordance with 25.9.1of the Chapter, the Party
        that delivered the notice of arbitration, and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) in an arbitration commenced in accordance with 25.9.2 of the Chapter, the

        arbitrate;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b) <in:strong>"Arbitral Award"</in:strong> means any decision of the Arbitral
        Tribunal on the substance of the Disagreement submitted to it, and includes:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) an interim award, including an interim award made for the preservation of

        the Chapter; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) an agreement to arbitrate a Disagreement as described in 25.9.2 of the
        Chapter;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>e) <in:strong>"Chapter"</in:strong> means Chapter 25 Dispute
        Resolution;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>f) <in:strong>"Respondent"</in:strong><in:strong/>means a Participating Party
        other than the Applicant;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>g) <in:strong>"Supreme Court"</in:strong> means the Supreme Court of
        British Columbia.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>2. A reference in this Appendix, other than in paragraph 88 or 117 a), to a
        claim, applies to a counterclaim, and a reference in this Appendix to a defence, applies to
        a defence to a counterclaim.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>3. Despite 25.1.4 of the Chapter, the Participating Parties may not vary
        paragraph 55 or 99.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMMUNICATIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>4. Except in respect of administrative details, the Participating Parties will
        not communicate with the Arbitral Tribunal:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) orally, except in the presence of all other Participating Parties;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) in writing, without immediately sending a copy of that communication to all
        other Participating Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>5. Paragraph 4 also applies to any communication by the Arbitral Tribunal to the
        Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO OBJECT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>6. A Participating Party that knows that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) any provision of this Appendix; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) any requirement under the Agreement or Arbitral Agreement,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>has not been complied with, and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating
        its objection to non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for
        stating that objection, within that period of time, will be deemed to have waived its right
        to object.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>7. In paragraph 6 a) "any provision of this Appendix" means any provision of this
        Appendix in respect of which the Participating Parties may otherwise agree.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>EXTENT OF JUDICIAL INTERVENTION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>8. In matters governed by this Appendix:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) no court will intervene except as provided in this Appendix; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) no arbitral proceeding of an Arbitral Tribunal, or an order, ruling or
        Arbitral Award made by an Arbitral Tribunal will be questioned, reviewed or restrained by a
        proceeding under any Provincial Law or Federal Law that permits judicial review except to
        the extent provided in this Appendix.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONSTRUCTION OF APPENDIX</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>9. In construing a provision of this Appendix, a court or Arbitral Tribunal may
        refer to the documents of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and its
        working group respecting the preparation of the UNCITRAL Model Arbitration Law and will give
        those documents the weight that is appropriate in the circumstances.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>STAY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>10. If a Participating Party commences legal proceedings in a court against
        another Participating Party in respect of a Disagreement required or agreed to be submitted
        to arbitration in accordance with 25.9.1 or 25.9.2 of the Chapter, a Participating Party to
        the legal proceedings may, before or after entering an appearance, and before delivery of
        any pleadings or taking any other step in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the
        proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>11. In an application contemplated by paragraph 10, the court will make an order
        staying the legal proceedings unless it determines that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Arbitral Agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being
        performed; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the legal proceedings are in accordance with the Chapter.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>12. An arbitration may be commenced or continued, and an Arbitral Award made,
        even if an application has been brought in accordance with paragraph 10, and the issue is
        pending before the court.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>INTERIM MEASURES BY COURT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>13. It is not incompatible with an Arbitral Agreement for a Participating Party
        to request from a court, before or during arbitral proceedings, an interim measure of
        protection as provided in 25.3.4 of the Chapter, and for a court to grant that
        measure.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMMENCEMENT OF ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>14. The arbitral proceedings in respect of a Disagreement:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) required to be arbitrated in accordance with 25.9.1 of the Chapter, commences
        on delivery of the notice of arbitration to the Participating Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) agreed to be arbitrated in accordance with 25.9.2 of the Chapter, commences on
        the date of the Arbitral Agreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>NOTICE OF ARBITRATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>15. A notice of arbitration contemplated by 25.9.1 of the Chapter will be in
        writing and contain the following information:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) a statement of the subject matter or issues of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) a requirement that the Disagreement be referred to arbitration;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the remedy sought;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the suggested number of arbitrators; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) any preferred qualifications of the arbitrators.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>16. A notice of arbitration contemplated by paragraph 15 may contain the names of
        any proposed arbitrators, including the information specified in paragraph 18.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>ARBITRATORS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>17. In an arbitration:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) required to be arbitrated in accordance with 25.9.1 of the Chapter, there will
        be three arbitrators; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) agreed to be arbitrated in accordance with 25.9.2 of the Chapter, there will
        be one arbitrator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>18. A person eligible for appointment as:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) a single arbitrator or as chair of an Arbitral Tribunal will be an experienced
        arbitrator or arbitration counsel or have had training in arbitral procedure;
        and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) a single arbitrator or as a member of an arbitral panel:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) will be independent and impartial; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) preferably, will have knowledge of, or experience in, the subject matter or
        issues of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent3><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPOINTMENT OF ARBITRATORS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>19. A Participating Party proposing the name of an arbitrator to another
        Participating Party in accordance with paragraph 16 will also submit a copy of that
        individual's r<in:eacute/>sum<in:eacute/> and the statement that individual is required to
        make in accordance with paragraph 27.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>20. In an arbitration with a single arbitrator, if the Participating Parties fail
        to agree on the arbitrator within 30 days after the commencement of the arbitration, the
        appointment will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority, on the written request of a
        Participating Party that is copied to the other Participating Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>21. In an arbitration with three arbitrators and two Participating Parties, each
        Participating Party will appoint one arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators will
        appoint the third arbitrator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>22. In the appointment procedure contemplated by paragraph 21, if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) a Participating Party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days after the
        commencement of the arbitration; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within 30
        days after the last of them was appointed,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the appointment will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority, on the written
        request of a Participating Party that is copied to the other Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>23. In an arbitration with three arbitrators and three Participating Parties, the
        three Participating Parties will jointly appoint the three arbitrators.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>24. In the arbitration procedure contemplated by paragraph 23, if the three
        Participating Parties fail to agree on the three arbitrators within 60 days after the
        commencement of the arbitration, the appointments will be made by the Neutral Appointing
        Authority, on the written request of a Participating Party copied to the other Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>25. In an arbitration procedure contemplated by paragraphs 21 or 23, the three
        arbitrators will select a chair of the Arbitral Tribunal. In the event that the three
        arbitrators are unable to agree on the selection of a chair before the pre-hearing meeting,
        they will so advise the Neutral Appointing Authority in writing and the Neutral Appointing
        Authority will select a chair.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>26. The Neutral Appointing Authority, in appointing an arbitrator, will have due
        regard to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) any qualifications required of the arbitrator as set out in paragraph 18 or as
        otherwise agreed in writing by the Participating Parties; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent
        and impartial arbitrator or chair.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>27. When an individual is approached in connection with possible appointment as
        an arbitrator, that individual will provide a written statement:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) disclosing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to
        his or her independence or impartiality; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) advising that the individual is not aware of any circumstances of that nature
        and committing to disclose them if they arise or become known at a later date.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>28. An arbitrator, from the time of appointment and throughout the arbitral
        proceedings, will, without delay, disclose to the Participating Parties any circumstances
        referred to in paragraph 27 unless the Participating Parties have already been informed of
        them.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>29. An arbitrator may be challenged only if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the
        arbitrator's independence or impartiality; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the arbitrator does not possess the qualifications set out in this Appendix or
        as otherwise agreed in writing by the Participating Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>30. A Participating Party may only challenge an arbitrator appointed by that
        Participating Party, or in whose appointment that Participating Party has participated, for
        reasons of which that Participating Party becomes aware after the appointment has been
        made.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>31. A person who is Maa‑nulth‑aht or a Maa‑nulth First Nation Citizen, or related
        to Maa‑nulth‑aht or a Maa‑nulth First Nation Citizen, may not be challenged in accordance
        with paragraph 29 solely on the grounds of that citizenship or relationship.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CHALLENGE PROCEDURE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>32. A Participating Party who intends to challenge an arbitrator will send to the
        Arbitral Tribunal a written statement of the reasons for the challenge within 15 days after
        becoming aware of the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, or after becoming aware of any
        circumstances referred to in paragraph 29.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>33. Unless the arbitrator challenged in accordance with paragraph 32 withdraws
        from office, or the other Participating Parties agree to the challenge, the Arbitral
        Tribunal will decide on the challenge.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>34. If a challenge in accordance with any procedure agreed upon by the
        Participating Parties or in accordance with the procedure contemplated by paragraph 32 is
        not successful, the challenging Participating Party, within 30 days after having received
        notice of the decision rejecting the challenge, may request the Neutral Appointing Authority
        to decide on the challenge.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>35. The decision of the Neutral Appointing Authority contemplated by paragraph 34
        is final and is not subject to appeal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>36. While a request contemplated by paragraph 34 is pending, the Arbitral
        Tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings and
        make an Arbitral Award unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the Neutral
        Appointing Authority is made would unduly prejudice the Participating Parties;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the Participating Parties agree otherwise.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>FAILURE OR IMPOSSIBILITY TO ACT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>37. The mandate of an arbitrator terminates if the arbitrator becomes unable at
        law, or as a practical matter, to perform the arbitrator's functions, or for other reasons
        fails to act without undue delay.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>38. If a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in
        paragraph 37, a Participating Party may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to decide
        on the termination of the mandate.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF MANDATE AND SUBSTITUTION OF ARBITRATOR</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>39. In addition to the circumstances contemplated by paragraphs 32 to 34, and 37,
        the mandate of an arbitrator terminates:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) if the arbitrator withdraws from office for any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) by, or pursuant to, agreement of the Participating Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>40. If the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a replacement arbitrator will be
        appointed in accordance with paragraphs 19 to 26, as applicable.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>41. If a single or chairing arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held
        will be repeated.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>42. If an arbitrator other than a single or chairing arbitrator is replaced, any
        hearings previously held may be repeated at the discretion of the Arbitral
        Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>43. An order or ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal made before the replacement of an
        arbitrator in accordance with paragraph 40 is not invalid solely because there has been a
        change in the composition of the tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMPETENCE OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO RULE ON ITS JURISDICTION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>44. An Arbitral Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>45. A plea that an Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction will be raised
        not later than the submission of the statement of defence. A Participating Party is not
        precluded from raising that plea by the fact that the party has appointed, or participated
        in the appointment of, an arbitrator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>46. A plea that an Arbitral Tribunal is exceeding the scope of its jurisdiction
        will be made as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its jurisdiction is
        raised during the arbitral proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>47. An Arbitral Tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in paragraph 45
        or 46, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>48. An Arbitral Tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph 45 or 46
        either as a preliminary question or in the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>49. If an Arbitral Tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has
        jurisdiction, any Participating Party, within 15 days after having received notice of that
        ruling, may request the Supreme Court to decide the matter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>50. A decision of the Supreme Court contemplated by paragraph 49 is final and is
        not subject to appeal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>51. While a request contemplated by paragraph 49 is pending, an Arbitral Tribunal
        may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an Arbitral Award unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the Supreme Court is
        made would unduly prejudice the Participating Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the Participating Parties agree otherwise.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>INTERIM MEASURES ORDERED BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>52. Unless otherwise agreed by the Participating Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal
        may, at the request of a Participating Party, order a Participating Party to take any
        interim measure of protection as the Arbitral Tribunal may consider necessary in respect of
        the subject matter of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>53. The Arbitral Tribunal may require a Participating Party to provide
        appropriate security in connection with a measure ordered in accordance with paragraph
        52.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>EQUAL TREATMENT OF PARTIES</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>54. The Participating Parties will be treated with equality and each
        Participating Party will be given a full opportunity to present its case.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DETERMINATION OF RULES OF PROCEDURE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>55. Subject to this Appendix, the Participating Parties may agree on the
        procedure to be followed by the Arbitral Tribunal in conducting the
        proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>56. Failing any agreement in accordance with paragraph 55, the Arbitral Tribunal,
        subject to this Appendix, may conduct the arbitration in the manner it considers
        appropriate.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>57. The Arbitral Tribunal is not required to apply the legal rules of evidence,
        and may determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any
        evidence.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>58. The Arbitral Tribunal will make all reasonable efforts to conduct the
        arbitral proceedings in the most efficient, expeditious and cost effective manner as is
        appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>59. The Arbitral Tribunal may extend or abridge a period of time:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) set in this Appendix, except the period specified in paragraph 107;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) established by the tribunal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>PRE-HEARING MEETING</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>60. Within 10 days after the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the tribunal will
        convene a pre-hearing meeting of the Participating Parties to reach agreement and to make
        any necessary orders on</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) any procedural issues arising in accordance with this Appendix;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) selection of the Arbitral Tribunal's chair;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the procedure to be followed in the arbitration;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the time periods for taking steps in the arbitration;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) the scheduling of hearings or meetings, if any;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>f) any preliminary applications or objections; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>g) any other matter which will assist the arbitration to proceed in an efficient
        and expeditious manner.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>61. The Arbitral Tribunal will prepare and distribute promptly to the Parties a
        written record of all the business transacted, and decisions and orders made, at the
        pre-hearing meeting.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>62. The pre-hearing meeting may be conducted by conference call.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>PLACE OF ARBITRATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>63. The arbitration will take place in the Province of
        British Columbia.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>64. Despite paragraph 63, an Arbitral Tribunal may meet at any place it considers
        appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the
        Participating Parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or other personal property, or
        for viewing physical locations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>LANGUAGE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>65. If the Arbitral Tribunal determines that it was necessary or reasonable for a
        Participating Party to incur the costs of translation of documents and oral presentations in
        the circumstances of a particular Disagreement, the Arbitral Tribunal, on application of a
        Participating Party, may order that any of the costs of that translation are costs of the
        arbitration contemplated by 25.14.2 of the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>STATEMENTS OF CLAIM AND DEFENCE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>66. Within 21 days after the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Applicant will
        deliver a written statement to all the Participating Parties stating the facts supporting
        its claim or position, the points at issue and the relief or remedy sought.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>67. Within 15 days after receipt of the Applicant's statement, each Respondent
        will deliver a written statement to all the Participating Parties stating its defence or
        position in respect of those particulars.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>68. Each Participating Party will attach to its statement a list of
        documents:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) upon which the Participating Party intends to rely; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) which describes each document by kind, date, author, addressee and subject
        matter.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>69. The Participating Parties may amend or supplement their statements, including
        the list of documents, and deliver counter-claims and defences to counter-claims during the
        course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the Arbitral Tribunal considers it inappropriate
        to allow the amendment, supplement or additional pleadings having regard to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the delay in making it; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) any prejudice suffered by the other Participating Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>70. The Participating Parties will deliver copies of all amended, supplemented or
        new documents delivered in accordance with paragraph 69 to all the Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DISCLOSURE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>71. The Arbitral Tribunal may order a Participating Party to produce, within a
        specified time, any documents that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) have not been listed in accordance with paragraph 68;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the Participating Party has in its care, custody or control; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the Arbitral Tribunal considers to be relevant.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>72. Each Participating Party will allow the other Participating Parties the
        necessary access at reasonable times to inspect and take copies of all documents that the
        former Participating Party has listed in accordance with paragraph 68, or that the Arbitral
        Tribunal has ordered to be produced in accordance with paragraph 71.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>73. The Participating Parties will prepare and send to the Arbitral Tribunal an
        agreed statement of facts within the time specified by the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>74. Not later than 21 days before a hearing commences, each Participating Party
        will give the other Participating Party:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the name and address of any witness and a written summary or statement of the
        witness's evidence; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) in the case of an expert witness, a written statement or report prepared by
        the expert witness.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>75. Not later than 15 days before a hearing commences, each Participating Party
        will give to the other Participating Party and the Arbitral Tribunal an assembly of all
        documents to be introduced at the hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>HEARINGS AND WRITTEN PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>76. The Arbitral Tribunal will decide whether to hold hearings for the
        presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the proceedings will be conducted
        on the basis of documents and other materials.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>77. Unless the Participating Parties have agreed that no hearings will be held,
        the Arbitral Tribunal will hold hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so
        requested by a Participating Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>78. The Arbitral Tribunal will give the Participating Parties sufficient advance
        notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the Arbitral Tribunal for the purpose of
        inspection of documents, goods or other property or viewing any physical
        location.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>79. All statements, documents or other information supplied to, or applications
        made to, the Arbitral Tribunal by one Participating Party will be communicated to the other
        Participating Parties, and any expert report, evidentiary document or case law on which the
        Arbitral Tribunal may rely in making its decision will be communicated to the Participating
        Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>80. Unless ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal, all hearings and meetings in
        arbitral proceedings, other than meetings of the Arbitral Tribunal, are open to the
        public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>81. The Arbitral Tribunal will schedule hearings to be held on consecutive days
        until completion.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>82. All oral evidence will be taken in the presence of the Arbitral Tribunal and
        all the Participating Parties unless a Participating Party is absent by default or has
        waived the right to be present.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>83. The Arbitral Tribunal may order any individual to be examined by the Arbitral
        Tribunal under oath or on affirmation in relation to the Disagreement and to produce before
        the Arbitral Tribunal all relevant documents within the individual's care, custody or
        control.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>84. The document assemblies delivered in accordance with paragraph 75 will be
        deemed to have been entered into evidence at the hearing without further proof and without
        being read out at the hearing, but a Participating Party may challenge the admissibility of
        any document so introduced.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>85. If the Arbitral Tribunal considers it just and reasonable to do so, the
        Arbitral Tribunal may permit a document that was not previously listed in accordance with
        paragraph 68, or produced in accordance with paragraph 71 or 75, to be introduced at the
        hearing, but the Arbitral Tribunal may take that failure into account when fixing the costs
        to be awarded in the arbitration.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>86. If the Arbitral Tribunal permits the evidence of a witness to be presented as
        a written statement, the other Participating Party may require that witness to be made
        available for cross examination at the hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>87. The Arbitral Tribunal may order a witness to appear and give evidence, and,
        in that event, the Participating Parties may cross examine that witness and call evidence in
        rebuttal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFAULT OF A PARTY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>88. If, without showing sufficient cause, the Applicant fails to communicate its
        statement of claim in accordance with paragraph 66, the Arbitral Tribunal may terminate the
        proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>89. If, without showing sufficient cause, a Respondent fails to communicate its
        statement of defence in accordance with paragraph 67, the Arbitral Tribunal will continue
        the proceedings without treating that failure in itself as an admission of the Applicant's
        allegations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>90. If, without showing sufficient cause, a Participating Party fails to appear
        at the hearing or to produce documentary evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal may continue the
        proceedings and make the Arbitral Award on the evidence before it.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>91. Before terminating the proceedings contemplated by paragraph 88, the Arbitral
        Tribunal will give all Respondents written notice providing an opportunity to file a
        statement of claim in respect of the Disagreement within a specified period of
        time.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>EXPERT APPOINTED BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>92. After consulting the Participating Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal
        may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) appoint one or more experts to report to it on specific issues to be
        determined by the Arbitral Tribunal; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) for that purpose, require a Participating Party to give the expert any
        relevant information or to produce, or to provide access to, any relevant documents, goods
        or other personal property or land for inspection or viewing.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>93. The Arbitral Tribunal will give a copy of the expert's report to the
        Participating Parties who will have an opportunity to reply to it.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>94. If a Participating Party so requests, or if the Arbitral Tribunal considers
        it necessary, the expert will, after delivery of a written or oral report, participate in a
        hearing where the Participating Parties will have the opportunity to cross examine the
        expert and to call any evidence in rebuttal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>95. The expert will, on the request of a Participating Party:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) make available to that Participating Party for examination all documents,
        goods or other property in the expert's possession, and provided to the expert in order to
        prepare a report; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) provide that Participating Party with a list of all documents, goods or other
        personal property or land not in the expert's possession but which were provided to or given
        access to the expert, and a description of the location of those documents, goods or other
        personal property or lands.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>LAW APPLICABLE TO SUBSTANCE OF DISPUTE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>96. An Arbitral Tribunal will decide the Disagreement in accordance with the
        law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>97. If the Participating Parties have expressly authorized it to do so, an
        Arbitral Tribunal may decide the Disagreement based upon equitable
        considerations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>98. In all cases, an Arbitral Tribunal will make its decisions in accordance with
        the spirit and intent of the Agreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>99. Before a final Arbitral Award is made, an Arbitral Tribunal or a
        Participating Party, with the agreement of the other Participating Parties, may refer a
        question of law to the Supreme Court for a ruling.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>100. A Participating Party may appeal a decision in the Supreme Court
        contemplated by paragraph 99 to the British Columbia Court of Appeal with leave of the
        British Columbia Court of Appeal. If the British Columbia Court of Appeal:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) refuses to grant leave to a Participating Party to appeal a ruling of the
        Supreme Court contemplated by paragraph 99; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) hears an appeal from a ruling of the Supreme Court contemplated by paragraph
        99,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal may not be appealed to the
        Supreme Court of Canada.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>101. While a referral contemplated by paragraph 99 is pending, the Arbitral
        Tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an Arbitral Award
        unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the ruling of the Supreme Court is
        made would unduly prejudice the Participating Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the Participating Parties agree otherwise.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DECISION MAKING BY PANEL OF ARBITRATORS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>102. In arbitral proceedings with more than one arbitrator, any decision of the
        Arbitral Tribunal will be made by a majority of all its members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>103. If there is no majority decision on a matter to be decided, the decision of
        the chair of the tribunal is the decision of the tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>104. Notwithstanding paragraph 102, if authorized by the Participating Parties or
        all the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, questions of procedure may be decided by the chair
        of the tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>SETTLEMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>105. If, during arbitral proceedings, those Participating Parties who are
        directly engaged in the Disagreement agree to settle the Disagreement, the Arbitral Tribunal
        will terminate the proceedings and, if requested by those Participating Parties, will record
        the settlement in the form of an Arbitral Award on agreed terms.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>106. An Arbitral Award on agreed terms:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) will be made in accordance with paragraphs 108 to 110;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) will state that it is an Arbitral Award; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) has the same status and effect as any other Arbitral Award on the substance of
        the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>FORM AND CONTENT OF ARBITRAL AWARD</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>107. An Arbitral Tribunal will make its final Arbitral Award as soon as possible
        and, in any event, not later than 60 days after:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the hearings have been closed; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the final submission has been made,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>whichever is the later date.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>108. An Arbitral Award will be made in writing, and be signed by the members of
        the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>109. An Arbitral Award will state the reasons upon which it is based,
        unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Participating Parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the award is an Arbitral Award on agreed terms contemplated by paragraphs 105
        and 106.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>110. A signed copy of an Arbitral Award will be delivered to all the Parties by
        the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>111. At any time during the arbitral proceedings, an Arbitral Tribunal may make
        an interim Arbitral Award on any matter with respect to which it may make a final Arbitral
        Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>112. An Arbitral Tribunal may award interest.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>113. The costs of an arbitration are in the discretion of the Arbitral Tribunal
        which, in making an order for costs, may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) include as costs:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and expert witnesses;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) legal fees and expenses of the Participating Parties;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii) any administration fees of a Neutral Appointing Authority; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iv) any other expenses incurred in connection with the arbitral proceedings;
        and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b) specify:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) the Participating Party entitled to costs;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) the Participating Party who will pay the costs;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii) subject to paragraph 112, the amount of costs or method of determining that
        amount; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iv) the manner in which the costs will be paid.</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent1>For greater certainty, for the purpose of this paragraph, all Maa‑nulth First
        Nations who are Participating Parties are one party for the purpose of determining the
        sharing of costs.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>114. For purposes of paragraph 113, an Arbitral Tribunal may award up to 50% of
        the reasonable and necessary legal fees and expenses that were actually incurred by a
        Participating Party, and if the legal services were provided by an employee or employees of
        that Participating Party, the Arbitral Tribunal may fix an amount or determine an hourly
        rate to be used in the calculation of the cost of those employee legal fees.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>115. An Arbitral Tribunal will close any hearings if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Participating Parties advise they have no further evidence to give or
        submissions to make; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the tribunal considers further hearings to be unnecessary or
        inappropriate.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>116. A final Arbitral Award, or an order of the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance
        with paragraph 117, terminates arbitral proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>117. An Arbitral Tribunal will issue an order for the termination of the arbitral
        proceedings if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Applicant withdraws its claim, unless the Respondent objects to the order
        and the Arbitral Tribunal recognizes a legitimate interest in obtaining a final settlement
        of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the Participating Parties agree on the termination of the proceedings;
        or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for
        any other reason become unnecessary or impossible.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>118. Subject to paragraphs 119 to 124 and paragraph 128, the mandate of an
        Arbitral Tribunal terminates with the termination of the arbitral proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CORRECTION AND INTERPRETATION OF AWARD; <in:br/>ADDITIONAL AWARD</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>119. Within 30 days after receipt of an Arbitral Award:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) a Participating Party may request the Arbitral Tribunal to correct in the
        tribunal award any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any other
        errors of a similar nature; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) a Participating Party may, if agreed by all the Participating Parties, request
        the Arbitral Tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the Arbitral
        Award.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>120. If an Arbitral Tribunal considers a request made in accordance with
        paragraph 119 to be justified, it will make the correction or give the interpretation within
        30 days after receipt of the request and the interpretation will form part of the Arbitral
        Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>121. An Arbitral Tribunal, on its own initiative, may correct any error of the
        type referred to in sub-paragraph 119a) within 30 days after the date of the Arbitral
        Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>122. A Participating Party may request, within 30 days after receipt of an
        Arbitral Award, the Arbitral Tribunal to make an additional Arbitral Award respecting claims
        presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>123. If the Arbitral Tribunal considers a request made in accordance with
        paragraph 122 to be justified, it will make an additional Arbitral Award within 60
        days.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>124. Paragraphs 108 to 110, and paragraphs 112 to 114 apply to a correction or
        interpretation of an Arbitral Award made in accordance with paragraph 120 or 121, or to an
        additional Arbitral Award made in accordance with paragraph 123.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPLICATION FOR SETTING ASIDE ARBITRAL AWARD</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>125. Subject to paragraphs 130 and 132, an Arbitral Award may be set aside by the
        Supreme Court, and no other court, only if a Participating Party making the application
        establishes that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the Participating Party making the application:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the
        arbitral proceedings; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) was otherwise unable to present its case or respond to the other
        Participating Party's case;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b) the Arbitral Award:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) deals with a Disagreement not contemplated by or not falling within the terms
        of the submission to arbitration; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
        arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be
        separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the Arbitral Award that contains
        decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>c) the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in
        accordance with the agreement of the Participating Parties, unless that agreement was in
        conflict with a provision of this Appendix from which the Participating Parties cannot
        derogate, or, failing any agreement, was not in accordance with this Appendix;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the Arbitral Tribunal or a member of it has committed a corrupt or fraudulent
        act; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) the award was obtained by fraud.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>126. An application for setting aside may not be made more than three
        months:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) after the date on which the Participating Party making that application
        received the Arbitral Award; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) if a request had been made in accordance with paragraph 119 or 122, after the
        date on which that request was disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>127. An application to set aside an award on the ground that the Arbitral
        Tribunal or a Member of it has committed a corrupt or fraudulent act or that the award was
        obtained by fraud will be commenced:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) within the period referred to in paragraph 126; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) within 30 days after the Applicant discovers or ought to have discovered the
        fraud or corrupt or fraudulent act</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>whichever is the longer period.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>128. When asked to set aside an Arbitral Award, the Supreme Court may, where it
        is appropriate and it is requested by a Participating Party, adjourn the proceedings to set
        aside the Arbitral Award for a period of time determined by it in order to give the Arbitral
        Tribunal an opportunity:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) to resume the arbitral proceedings; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) to take any other action that, in the Arbitral Tribunal's opinion, will
        eliminate the grounds for setting aside the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>129. A Party that was not a Participating Party in an arbitration will be given
        notice of an application in accordance with paragraph 125, and is entitled to be a party to,
        and make representation on, the application.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPEAL ON QUESTION OF LAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>130. A Participating Party may appeal an Arbitral Award to the Supreme Court,
        with leave, on a question of law, which the Supreme Court will grant only if it is satisfied
        that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) the importance of the result of the arbitration to the Participating Parties
        justifies the intervention of the court, and the determination of the point of law may
        prevent a miscarriage of justice; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) the point of law is of general or public importance.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>131. An application for leave may not be made more than three
        months:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) after the date on which the Participating Party making the application
        received the Arbitral Award; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) if a request had been made in accordance with paragraph 119 or 122, after the
        date on which that request was disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>132. The Supreme Court may confirm, vary or set aside the Arbitral Award or may
        remit the award to the Arbitral Tribunal with directions, including the court's opinion on
        the question of law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>133. When asked to set aside an Arbitral Award the Supreme Court may, where it is
        appropriate and it is requested by a Participating Party, adjourn the proceedings to set
        aside the Arbitral Award for a period of time determined by it in order to give the Arbitral
        Tribunal an opportunity:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) to resume the arbitral proceedings; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) to take any other action that, in the Arbitral Tribunal's opinion, will
        eliminate the grounds for setting aside the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>134. A Participating Party that was not a Participating Party in an arbitration
        will be given notice of an application in accordance with paragraph 130 and is entitled to
        be a Participating Party to, and make representation on the application.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>135. A Participating Party may appeal a decision of the Supreme Court
        contemplated by paragraph 132 to the British Columbia Court of Appeal with leave of the
        British Columbia Court of Appeal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>136. If the British Columbia Court of Appeal:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) refuses to grant leave to a Party to appeal a ruling of the Supreme Court in
        accordance with paragraph 132; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) hears an appeal from a ruling of the Supreme Court contemplated by paragraph
        132,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal may not be appealed to the
        Supreme Court of Canada.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>137. No application may be made in accordance with paragraph 130 in respect
        of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) an Arbitral Award based upon equitable considerations as permitted in
        paragraph 97; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b) an Arbitral Award made in an arbitration commenced in accordance with
        paragraph 32 of the Chapter.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>138. No application for leave may be brought in accordance with paragraph 130 in
        respect of a ruling made by the Supreme Court in accordance with paragraph 99 if the time
        for appealing that ruling has already expired.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>139. An Arbitral Award will be recognized as binding and, upon application to the
        Supreme Court, will be enforced subject to 13.36.0.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>140. Unless the Supreme Court orders otherwise, the Party relying on an Arbitral
        Award or applying for its enforcement will supply the duly authenticated original Arbitral
        Award or a duly certified copy of it.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GROUNDS FOR REFUSING ENFORCEMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>141. Subject to paragraphs 129 and 134, a Party that was not a Participating
        Party in an arbitration will not bring an application in accordance with paragraph 125 or
        130 to set the award aside but may resist enforcement of the award against it by bringing an
        application in accordance with paragraph 142.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>142. On the application of a Party that was not a Participating Party in an
        arbitration, the Supreme Court may make an order refusing to enforce against that Party an
        Arbitral Award made in accordance with this Appendix if that Party establishes
        that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a) it was not given copies of:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) the notice of arbitration or agreement to arbitrate; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) the pleadings or all amendments and supplements to the
        pleadings;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b) the Arbitral Tribunal refused to add the Party as a Participating Party to the
        arbitration in accordance with paragraph 35 of the Chapter;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c) the Arbitral Award;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i) deals with a Disagreement not contemplated by or not falling within the terms
        of the submission to arbitration, or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii) contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
        arbitration,</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be
        separated from those not so submitted, that part of the Arbitral Award which contains
        decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d) the Arbitral Award has not yet become binding on the Parties or has been set
        aside or suspended by a court;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e) the Arbitral Tribunal or a Member of it has committed a corrupt or fraudulent
        act; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>f) the award was obtained by fraud.</bcl:indent2></bcl:schedule></act:content><bcl:multinav><bcl:navpage><bcl:navtitle>Contents</bcl:navtitle><bcl:navxmlfile>07043_00</bcl:navxmlfile></bcl:navpage><bcl:navpage><bcl:navtitle>Sections 1 to 31</bcl:navtitle><bcl:navxmlfile>07043_01</bcl:navxmlfile></bcl:navpage><bcl:navpage><bcl:navtitle>Schedule -
