        <in:strong>Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
          Awards</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>Article I</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>1  This Convention shall apply to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral
        awards made in the territory of a State other than the State where the recognition and
        enforcement of such awards are sought, and arising out of differences between persons,
        whether physical or legal. It shall also apply to arbitral awards not considered as domestic
        awards in the State where their recognition and enforcement are sought.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>2  The term "arbitral awards" shall include not only awards made by arbitrators
        appointed for each case but also those made by permanent arbitral bodies to which the
        parties have submitted.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>3  When signing, ratifying or acceding to this Convention, or notifying extension
        under article X hereof, any State may on the basis of reciprocity declare that it will apply
        the Convention to the recognition and enforcement of awards made only in the territory of
        another Contracting State. It may also declare that it will apply the Convention only to
        differences arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, which are
        considered as commercial under the national law of the State making such
        declaration.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>Article II</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>1  Each Contracting State shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the
        parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which
        may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or
        not, concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>2  The term "agreement in writing" shall include an arbitral clause in a contract
        or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or
        telegrams.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>3  The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in
        respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article,
        shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it
        finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being
        performed.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>Article III</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Each Contracting State shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce
        them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied
        upon, under the conditions laid down in the following articles. There shall not be imposed
        substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or
        enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies than are imposed on the
        recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>Article IV</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>1  To obtain the recognition and enforcement mentioned in the preceding article,
        the party applying for recognition and enforcement shall, at the time of the application,
        supply:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) The duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) The original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>2  If the said award or agreement is not made in an official language of the
        country in which the award is relied upon, the party applying for recognition and
        enforcement of the award shall produce a translation of these documents into such language.
        The translation shall be certified by an official or sworn translator or by a diplomatic or
        consular agent.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>Article V</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>1  Recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request of the
        party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent authority
        where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) The parties to the agreement referred to in article II were, under the law
          applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the
          law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the
          law of the country where the award was made; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the
          appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable
          to present his case; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(c) The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the
          terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the
          scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters
          submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the
          award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and
          enforced; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(d) The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in
          accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in
          accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(e) The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or
          suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which,
          that award was made.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>2  Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the
        competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds
        that:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) The subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration
          under the law of that country; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) The recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public
          policy of that country.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:centertext>Article VI</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made
        to a competent authority referred to in article V (1) (e), the authority before which the
        award is sought to be relied upon may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on
        the enforcement of the award and may also, on the application of the party claiming
        enforcement of the award, order the other party to give suitable security.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>Article VII</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>1  The provisions of the present Convention shall not affect the validity of
        multilateral or bilateral agreements concerning the recognition and enforcement of arbitral
        awards entered into by the Contracting States nor deprive any interested party of any right
        he may have to avail himself of an arbitral award in the manner and to the extent allowed by
        the law or the treaties of the country where such award is sought to be relied
        upon.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>2  The Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses of 1923 and the Geneva Convention
        on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1927 shall cease to have effect between
        Contracting States on their becoming bound and to the extent that they become bound, by this
        Convention.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>Article VIII</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>1  This Convention shall be open until 31 December 1958 for signature on behalf
        of any Member of the United Nations and also on behalf of any other State which is or
        hereafter becomes a member of any specialized agency of the United Nations, or which is or
        hereafter becomes a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, or any other
        State to which an invitation has been addressed by the General Assembly of the United
        Nations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>2  This Convention shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification shall be
        deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>Article IX</bcl:centertext>

        article VIII.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>2  Accession shall be effected by the deposit of an instrument of accession with
        the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>Article X</bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>1  Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, declare
        that this Convention shall extend to all or any of the territories for the international
        relations of which it is responsible. Such a declaration shall take effect when the
        Convention enters into force for the State concerned.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>2  At any time thereafter any such extension shall be made by notification
        addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and shall take effect as from the
        ninetieth day after the day of receipt by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of
        this notification, or as from the date of entry into force of the Convention for the State
        concerned, whichever is the later.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>3  With respect to those territories to which this Convention is not extended at
        the time of signature, ratification or accession, each State concerned shall consider the
        possibility of taking the necessary steps in order to extend the application of this
        Convention to such territories, subject, where necessary for constitutional reasons, to the
        consent of the Governments of such territories.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>Article XI</bcl:centertext>

        apply:</bcl:lefttext>

          legislative jurisdiction of the federal authority, the obligations of the federal

          Government shall bring such articles with a favourable recommendation to the notice of
          the appropriate authorities of constituent states or provinces at the earliest possible
          moment;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(c) A federal State Party to this Convention shall, at the request of any other
