        <in:em>INSTRUCTIONS:</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(1) The objective of the short form prospectus is to provide information concerning the issuer that an investor needs in order to make an informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific disclosure requirements that are in addition to the general requirement under securities legislation to provide full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities to be distributed. Certain rules of specific application impose prospectus disclosure obligations in addition to those described in this Form.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or interpreted in the Instrument or NI 41-101 bear that definition or interpretation. Other definitions are set out in NI 14-101.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(3) In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgement in the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is considered material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an offsetting effect.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(4) Unless an item specifically requires disclosure only in the preliminary short form prospectus, the disclosure requirements set out in this Form apply to both the preliminary short form prospectus and the short form prospectus. Details concerning the price and other matters dependent upon or relating to price, such as the number of securities being distributed, may be left out of the preliminary short form prospectus, along with specifics concerning the plan of distribution, to the extent that these matters have not been decided.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(5) Any information required in a short form prospectus may be incorporated by reference in the short form prospectus, other than confidential material change reports. Clearly identify in a short form prospectus any document incorporated by reference. If an excerpt of a document is incorporated by reference, clearly identify the excerpt in the short form prospectus by caption and paragraph of the document. Any material incorporated by reference in a short form prospectus is required under sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the Instrument to be filed with the short form prospectus unless it has been previously filed.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(6) The disclosure must be understandable to readers and presented in an easy-to-read format. The presentation of information should comply with the plain language principles listed in section 4.2 of Companion Policy 44-101CP Short Form Prospectus Distributions. If technical terms are required, clear and concise explanations should be included.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(7) No reference need be made to inapplicable items and, unless otherwise required in this Form, negative answers to items may be omitted.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(8) Where the term "issuer" is used, it may be necessary, in order to meet the requirement for full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts, to also include disclosure with respect to persons or companies that the issuer is required, under the issuer's GAAP, to consolidate, proportionately consolidate or account for using the equity method (for example, including "subsidiaries" as that term is used in Canadian GAAP applicable to publicly accountable enterprises). If it is more likely than not that a person or company will become an entity that the issuer will be required, under the issuer's GAAP, to consolidate, proportionately consolidate or account for using the equity method, it may be necessary to also include disclosure with respect to the person or company.</in:em>

      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>INSTRUCTIONS: There may be factors relating to a security that are not addressed by a credit rating organization when they give a rating. For example, in the case of cash settled derivative instruments, factors in addition to the creditworthiness of the issuer, such as the continued subsistence of the underlying interest or the volatility of the price, value or level of the underlying interest may be reflected in the rating analysis. Rather than being addressed in the rating itself, these factors may be described by a credit rating organization by way of a superscript or other notation to a rating. Any such attributes must be discussed in the disclosure under this Item.</in:em>
