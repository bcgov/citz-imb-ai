Compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of the management of [name of mutual fund] (the "Fund").

      <bcl:indent1>We conducted our audit in accordance with standards for assurance engagements set out in the CICA Handbook â€” Assurance.

      <bcl:lefttext>In our opinion, the Fund's statement of compliance for the year ended [insert date] complies, in all material respects, with the applicable requirements of Parts 9, 10 and 11 of National Instrument 81-102.</bcl:lefttext>

      <bcl:indent1>(1) For the purposes of Item 2, if it has been less than 10 years since securities of the mutual fund were first available to the public, and if the mutual fund is a clone fund and the underlying fund has 10 years of performance history, or if there is another mutual fund with 10 years of performance history that is subject to this Instrument, and has the same fund manager, portfolio manager, investment objectives and investment strategies as the mutual fund, then in either case the mutual fund must calculate the standard deviation of the mutual fund in accordance with Item 2 by</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) using the available return history of the mutual fund, and</bcl:indent2>

      <bcl:indent2>(a) using the return history of the mutual fund, and</bcl:indent2>

      <bcl:indent1>(2) When using a reference index, a mutual fund must</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) monitor the reasonableness of the reference index on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary, and </bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) disclose in the mutual fund's prospectus in Part B, Item 9.1 of Form 81-101F1 of National Instrument 81-101 <in:em>Mutual Fund Prospectus Disclosure</in:em> or Part B, Item 12.2 of Form 41-101F2 of National Instrument 41-101 <in:em>General Prospectus Requirements</in:em>, as applicable,</bcl:indent2>

      <bcl:indent2>
        <in:em>(e) is consistent with the investment objectives and investment strategies in which the mutual fund is investing,</in:em>

      <bcl:indent1>(1) For the purposes of Item 2, if there has been a reorganization or transfer of assets of the mutual fund pursuant to paragraph 5.1 (1) (f) or (g) or subparagraph 5.1 (1) (h) (i) of the Instrument, the standard deviation must be calculated using the monthly "return on investment" of the continuing mutual fund.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) Despite subsection (1), if there has been a change to the fundamental investment objectives of the mutual fund pursuant to paragraph 5.1 (1) (c) of the Instrument, for the purposes of Item 2, the standard deviation must be calculated using the monthly return on investment of the mutual fund starting from the date of that change.</bcl:indent1>
