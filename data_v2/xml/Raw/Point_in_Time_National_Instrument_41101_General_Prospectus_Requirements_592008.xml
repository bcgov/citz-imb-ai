      <lefttext>The regulators listed in Schedule 3 Regulators collect the personal information in Schedule 1 <em>Personal Information Form</em> under the authority granted to them under provincial and territorial securities legislation. Under securities legislation, the regulators do not make any of the information provided in Schedule 1 public.</lefttext>
      <lefttext>The regulators collect the personal information in Schedule 1 for the purpose of enabling the regulators to administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities legislation, including those provisions that require or permit the regulators to refuse to issue a receipt for a prospectus if it appears to the regulators that the past conduct of management or promoters of the Issuer affords reasonable grounds for belief that the business of the Issuer will not be conducted with integrity and in the best interests of its securityholders.</lefttext>
      <lefttext>You understand that by signing the certificate and consent in Schedule 1, you are consenting to the Issuer submitting your personal information in Schedule 1 (the "Information") to the regulators and to the collection and use by the regulators of the Information, as well as any other information that may be necessary to administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities legislation. This may include the collection of information from law enforcement agencies, other government or non-governmental regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations, exchanges, and quotation and trade reporting systems in order to conduct background checks, verify the Information and perform investigations and conduct enforcement proceedings as required to ensure compliance with provincial and territorial securities legislation.</lefttext>
      <lefttext>You understand that the Issuer is required to deliver the Information to the regulators because the Issuer has filed a prospectus under provincial and territorial securities legislation. You also understand that you have a right to be informed of the existence of personal information about you that is kept by regulators, that you have the right to request access to that information, and that you have the right to request that such information be corrected, subject to the applicable provisions of the freedom of information and protection of privacy legislation adopted by each province and territory.</lefttext>
      <lefttext>You also understand and agree that the Information the regulators collect about you may also be disclosed, as permitted by law, where its use and disclosure is for the purposes described above. The regulators may also use a third party to process the Information, but when this happens, the third party will be carefully selected and obligated to comply with the limited use restrictions described above and with provincial and federal privacy legislation.</lefttext>
      <lefttext>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> It is an offence to submit information that, in a material respect and at the time and in the light of the circumstances in which it is submitted, is misleading or untrue.</lefttext>
      <lefttext>
        <strong>Questions</strong>
      </lefttext>
      <lefttext>If you have any questions about the collection, use, and disclosure of the information you provide to the regulators, you may contact the regulator in the jurisdiction in which the required information is filed, at the address or telephone number listed in Schedule 3.</lefttext>

        <em>In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgment in the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an Item 's significance to investors, analysts and other users of the information. An Item of information, or an aggregate of items, is considered material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an offsetting effect. This concept of materiality is consistent with the financial reporting notion of materiality contained in the Handbook.</em>

    <bcl:indent1>(1) For a commodity pool, state in substantially the following words:</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>"You should carefully consider whether your financial condition permits you to participate in this investment. The securities of this commodity pool are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. You may lose a substantial portion or even all of the money you place in the commodity pool.</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent2>The risk of loss in trading [nature of instruments to be traded by the commodity pool] can be substantial. In considering whether to participate in the [commodity pool], you should be aware that trading [nature of instruments] can quickly lead to large losses as well as gains. Such trading losses can sharply reduce the net asset value of the [commodity pool] and consequently the value of your interest in the [commodity pool]. Also, market conditions may make it difficult or impossible for the [commodity pool] to liquidate a position.</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent2>The [commodity pool] is subject to certain conflicts of interest. The [commodity pool] will be subject to the charges payable by it as described in this prospectus that must be offset by revenues and trading gains before an investor is entitled to a return on his or her investment. It may be necessary for the [commodity pool] to make substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of its assets before an investor is entitled to a return on his or her investment."</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent1>(2) For the initial prospectus, state in substantially the following words:</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>"The [commodity pool] is newly organized. The success of the [commodity pool] will depend upon a number of conditions that are beyond the control of the [commodity pool]. There is substantial risk that the goals of the [commodity pool] will not be met."</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent1>(3) If the promoter, manager, or a portfolio adviser of the alternative mutual fund has not had a similar involvement with any other publicly offered alternative mutual fund, state in substantially the following words:</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>"The [promoter], [manager] [and/or] [portfolio adviser] of the [alternative mutual fund] has not previously operated any other publicly offered alternative mutual fund [or traded other accounts]."</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent1>(4) If the commodity pool will execute trades outside Canada, state in substantially the following words:</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>"Participation in transactions in [nature of instrument to be traded by the commodity pool] involves the execution and clearing of trades on or subject to the rules of a foreign market.</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent2>None of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities or Canadian exchanges regulates activities of any foreign markets, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, or has the power to compel enforcement of the rule of a foreign market or any applicable foreign law. Generally, any foreign transaction will be governed by applicable foreign laws. This is true even if the foreign market is formally linked to a Canadian market so that a position taken on a market may be liquidated by a transaction on another market. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary depending on the foreign country in which the transaction occurs.</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent2>For these reasons, entities such as the commodity pool that trade [nature of instrument to be traded by the commodity pool] may not be afforded certain of the protective measures provided by Canadian legislation and the rules of Canadian exchanges. In particular, funds received from customers for transactions may not be provided the same protection as funds received in respect of transactions on Canadian exchanges."</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent1>(5) State that the commodity pool is a mutual fund but that certain provisions of securities legislation designed to protect investors who purchase securities of mutual funds do not apply.</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent1>(6) Immediately after the statements required by subsections (1) to (5), state in substantially the following words:</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>"These brief statements do not disclose all the risks and other significant aspects of investing in the [commodity pool]. You should therefore carefully study this prospectus, including a description of the principal risk factors at page [page number], before you decide to invest in the [commodity pool]."</bcl:indent2>

    <bcl:indent1>
      <in:em>(5) For a group scholarship plan or other type of scholarship plan that normally calculates the sales charge payable as a fixed dollar amount linked to the amount of contribution by a subscriber (i.e. $x.xx per unit), in addition to stating the fixed amount of sales charge per unit as required under Instruction (3), the disclosure of the amount of the sales charge in the table titled "Fees you pay" in the column titled "What you pay" must also be expressed as a percentage of the cost of a unit of the scholarship plan. If the total cost of a unit of the scholarship plan varies depending on the contribution option or frequency selected, the percentage sales charge must be expressed as a range, between the lowest and the highest percentage of the unit cost the sales charge can represent, based on the different contribution options available to subscribers under the scholarship plan. This must be calculated as follows: (i) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the highest total cost per unit, and (ii) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the lowest total cost per unit. For example, if a scholarship plan calculates its sales charge as $200/unit, and the total cost per unit for a subscriber can range from $1 000 to $5 000 (based on the different options available to subscribers), the percentage range of the sales charge disclosed in the table would be 4% (200/5000) to 20% (200/1000). The disclosure in the table must also state that the exact percentage of the sales charge per unit for a subscriber will depend on the contribution option selected for contributing to the scholarship plan and how old their beneficiary is at the time they open the scholarship plan.</in:em>
