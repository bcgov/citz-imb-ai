          <sectiontext>Every railway company will be held responsible for the general condition of all internal combustion locomotive cranes under its control. The mechanical officer in charge at each point where repairs are done will be held responsible for the inspection and repair for all internal combustion locomotive cranes and their appurtenances under his jurisdiction. He must know that all defects disclosed by any inspection are properly repaired before the locomotive crane is returned to service. The safe working pressure of all pressure parts shall be fixed by the chief inspector of the ministry after full consideration has been given to design, workmanship, age and condition.</sectiontext>
