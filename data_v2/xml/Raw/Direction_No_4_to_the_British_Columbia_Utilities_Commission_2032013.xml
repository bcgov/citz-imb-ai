        Premises.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, but subject to the conditions specified
        in section 4.2.2 being satisfied in each case, BC Hydro will permit to remain in operation,
        install, replace, maintain and service Legacy Meters and Radio-off Meters at a Residential

        <in:strong>4.2.2. Conditions for Retention or Installation of Legacy Meters and Radio-off
          Meters</in:strong>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The conditions that must be satisfied in order for BC Hydro to permit to remain
        in operation, install, replace, maintain and service Legacy Meters or Radio-off Meters at a
        Residential Service Customer's Premises are:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) the Customer is, as of the date of the Customer's election in accordance with
        clause (c) or deemed election in accordance with clause (d), taking Residential Service at
        the Customer's Premises;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) BC Hydro had not, before the date of the Customer's election in accordance
        with clause (c) or deemed election in accordance with clause (d), installed a Smart Meter at
        the Customer's Premises, but rather a Legacy Meter remained in place at those Premises as of
        the date of the Customer's election or deemed election; and</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) the Customer, during the period beginning September 1, 2013 and ending
        December 1, 2013, by notice to BC Hydro, elects to retain the Legacy Meter then in place at
        the Customer's Premises, or to have a Radio-off Meter installed in place of the Legacy
        Meter; or</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) the Customer, despite satisfaction of the conditions set out in clauses (a)
        and (b) has failed to provide notice of election to BC Hydro in accordance with clause (c),
        in which case the Customer shall be deemed to have elected effective December 1, 2013, to
        retain the existing Legacy Meter at the Customer's Premises and the Customer shall
        thereafter pay the charges for having a Legacy Meter installed at the Customer's Premises as
        set out in the Schedule of Standard Charges.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:strong>4.2.3. Periods during which Legacy Meters May Remain in Place</in:strong>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If the conditions set out in section 4.2.2 have been satisfied, Residential Service
        Customers who have satisfied the conditions in section 4.2.3 and who have elected, or are deemed to have
        elected, to retain a Legacy Meter at the Customer's Premises may continue to have their
        Electricity consumption measured by the Legacy Meter for the periods, and subject to the
        conditions, specified below:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) A Customer who has elected, or is deemed to have elected, to retain a Legacy
        Meter can continue to retain the Legacy Meter until the seal of the meter expires, or the
        meter ceases to function properly, whichever comes first.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) If the seal of a Legacy Meter expires, or the meter ceases to function
        properly before the seal expiry date, BC Hydro will, so long as it has a suitable Legacy
        Meter in its meter inventory available for installation, install a replacement Legacy Meter
        at the Customer's Premises. A Customer for whom a replacement Legacy Meter has been
        installed in accordance with the preceding sentence can continue to retain the replacement
        Legacy Meter for the period specified in clause (a), and any replacement Legacy Meter so
        installed shall be subject to replacement in accordance with this clause (b) as the occasion
        arises. For purposes of this section, BC Hydro will only be deemed to have suitable
        replacement Legacy Meters in its meter inventory if it has existing verified and sealed
        Legacy Meters in its meter inventory as of the date that a Legacy Meter in place at a
        Customer's Premises requires replacement, and BC Hydro is under no obligation to repair,
        rebuild or modify, or re-verify and re-seal, any Legacy Meters that have been removed from
        service for any reason, nor to purchase or otherwise acquire from any source any Legacy
        Meters in replenishment of its Legacy Meter inventory.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) In any case where the seal of a Legacy Meter expires, or the meter ceases to
        function properly, and BC Hydro does not have a suitable Legacy Meter in its meter inventory
        available for installation, BC Hydro will install either a Smart Meter or a Radio-off Meter
        at the Customer's Premises, at the Customer's election. A Customer with a Legacy Meter
        installed at the Customer's Premises can also elect to have a Smart Meter or a Radio-off
        Meter installed in place of the Legacy Meter at any time. A Customer who elects to have a
        Smart Meter or a Radio-off Meter installed at the Customer's Premises cannot later change
        back to a Legacy Meter at the applicable Premises.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) A Customer with a Legacy Meter in place at the Customer's Premises who moves
        to another Premises for which the Customer is eligible to take Residential Service, can
        elect to have a Smart Meter or Radio-off Meter installed at the new Premises, but cannot
        retain or have installed a Legacy Meter at the new Premises. Except where a Customer who is
        eligible to elect to have either a Smart Meter or a Radio-off Meter installed in a new
        Premises moves into the vacated premises and elects to have a Radio-off Meter installed, the
        vacated Premises will in all cases have a Smart Meter installed.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(e) A Customer with a Legacy Meter in place whose service is terminated for any
        reason whatsoever ceases to be eligible to retain a Legacy Meter, and if that Customer again
        takes Residential Service at the same or another Premises the Customer can elect to have
        either a Smart Meter or a Radio-off Meter installed upon resumption of
        service.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(f) In any case where a Customer ceases to be eligible to have a Legacy Meter
        installed at the Customer's Premises, or BC Hydro no longer has suitable Legacy Meters
        available for installation at the Customer's Premises, and the Customer is required to elect
        to have either a Radio-off Meter or a Smart Meter installed instead, but the Customer
        refuses or fails to make an election within 10 days after BC Hydro has delivered written
        notice to the Customer's Premises notifying the Customer that he or she must elect either a
        Radio-off Meter or a Smart Meter, the Customer will be deemed to have elected to have a
        Radio-off Meter installed and the Customer shall pay the charges for having a Radio-off
        Meter installed at the Customer's Premises as set out in the Schedule of Standard Charges
        from the date of BC Hydro's installation of the replacement Radio-off Meter.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:strong>4.2.4. Periods during which Radio-off Meters May Remain in Place</in:strong>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If the conditions set out in section 4.2.2 have been satisfied, Residential Service
        Customers who have satisfied the conditions in section 4.2.2 and who have elected, or is deemed to have
        elected, to have a Radio-off Meter installed may continue to have their Electricity
        consumption measured by the Radio-off Meter for the periods, and subject to the conditions,
        specified below:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) A Customer who has elected,or is deemed to have elected, to have a Radio-off
        Meter installed can continue to retain the Radio-off Meter, and have a replacement Radio-off
        Meter installed from time to time as necessary, for so long as the Customer continues to
        take Residential Service at the Customer's Premises.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) A Customer with a Radio-off Meter in place at the Customer's Premises who
        moves to another Premises for which the Customer is eligible to take Residential Service,
        may elect to have a Smart Meter or a Radio-off Meter installed at the new Premises. Except
        where a Customer who is eligible to have either a Smart Meter or a Radio-off Meter installed
        in a new Premises moves into the vacated Premises and elects to have a Radio-off Meter
        installed, the vacated Premises will in all cases have a Smart Meter
        installed.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) A Customer with a Radio-off Meter in place whose service is terminated for
        any reason whatsoever, but who again takes Residential Service at the same or another
        premises may elect to have either a Smart Meter or a Radio-off Meter installed upon
        resumption of service.</bcl:indent1>
