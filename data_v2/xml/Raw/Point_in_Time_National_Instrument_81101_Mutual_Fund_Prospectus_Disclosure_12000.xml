        <in:em>General</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(1) This Form describes the disclosure required in a simplified prospectus of a mutual fund. Each Item of this Form outlines disclosure requirements. Instructions to help you provide this disclosure are printed in italic type.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(2) Terms defined in National Instrument 81-101 Mutual Fund Prospectus Disclosure, National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds or National Instrument 81-105 Mutual Fund Sales Practices and used in this Form have the meanings that they have in those national instruments.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(3) A simplified prospectus shall state the required information concisely and in plain language. Reference should be made to Part 3 of Companion Policy 81-101CP for a discussion concerning plain language and presentation.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(4) Respond as simply and directly as is reasonably possible and include only as much information as is necessary for an understanding of the fundamental and particular characteristics of the mutual fund. Brevity is especially important in describing practices or aspects of a mutual fund's operations that do not differ materially from those of other mutual funds.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(5) National Instrument 81-101 requires the simplified prospectus to be presented in a format that assists in readability and comprehension. This Form does not mandate the use of a specific format to achieve these goals. However, mutual funds are encouraged to use, as appropriate, tables, captions, bullet points or other organizational techniques that assist in presenting the required disclosure clearly and concisely.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(6) Each Item shall be presented under the heading or sub-heading stipulated in this Form; references to the relevant Item number are optional. If no sub-heading for an Item is stipulated in this Form, a mutual fund may include sub-headings, under the required headings, at its option.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(7) A simplified prospectus may contain photographs and artwork only if they are relevant to the business of the mutual fund, mutual fund family or members of the organization of the mutual fund and are not misleading.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(8) Any footnotes to tables provided for under any Item in this Form may be deleted if the substance of the footnotes is otherwise provided.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Contents of a Simplified Prospectus</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(9) A simplified prospectus shall pertain to one mutual fund, and shall consist of two sections, a Part A section and a Part B section.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(10) The Part A section of a simplified prospectus contains the response to the Items in Part A of this Form and contains introductory information about the mutual fund, general information about mutual funds and information applicable to the mutual funds managed by the mutual fund organization.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(11) The Part B section of a simplified prospectus contains the response to the Items in Part B of this Form and contains specific information about the mutual fund to which the simplified prospectus pertains.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(12) Despite securities legislation, a simplified prospectus shall present each Item in the Part A section and each Item in the Part B section in the respective order provided for in this Form. However, the Part B section of the simplified prospectus may be placed in any location in the simplified prospectus. For a single SP, this means that the Part B section may be placed before the Part A section, somewhere in the middle of the Part A section or after the Part A section, except for the covers.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(13) Subsection 5.1 (3) of National Instrument 81-101 permits certain documents to be attached to, or bound with, a simplified prospectus. Those documents consist of the documents incorporated by reference into the simplified prospectus, educational material, account application documents, registered tax plan applications and documents and any point of sale disclosure documents required by securities legislation. No other documents may be attached to, or bound with, a simplified prospectus.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Consolidation of Simplified Prospectuses into a Multiple SP</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(14) Subsection 5.1 (1) of National Instrument 81-101 states that simplified prospectuses shall not be consolidated to form a multiple SP unless the Part A sections of each simplified prospectus are substantially similar. The Part A sections in a consolidated document need not be repeated. These provisions permit a mutual fund organization to create a document that contains the disclosure for a number of mutual funds in the same family.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(14.1) Subsection 5.1 (4) of National Instrument 81-101 states that a simplified prospectus of an alternative mutual fund must not be consolidated with a simplified prospectus of another mutual fund that is not an alternative mutual fund.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(15) As with a single SP, a multiple SP will consist of two Parts:</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>
        <in:em>1. A Part A section that contains general information about the mutual funds, or the mutual fund family, described in the document.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>
        <in:em>2. A number of Part B sections, each of which will provide specific information about one mutual fund. The Part B sections shall not be consolidated with each other so that, in a multiple SP, information about each of the mutual funds described in the document shall be provided on a fund by fund or catalogue basis and shall set out for each mutual fund separately the information required by Part B of this Form. Each Part B section shall start on a new page.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(16) For a multiple SP in which the Part A and Part B sections are bound together, the Part B sections may be placed at any location in the document; that is, before the Part A section, somewhere in the middle of the Part A section or after the Part A section, except for the back cover. If the Part B sections are bound with the Part A section, the Part B sections shall be kept together in the document.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(17) Section 5.3 of National Instrument 81-101 permits the Part B sections of a multiple SP to be bound separately from the Part A section of the document. If one Part B section is bound separately from the Part A section of the document, all Part B sections must be separate from the Part A section of the document.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(18) Subsection 5.3 (2) of National Instrument 81-101 permits Part B sections that have been bound separately from the related Part A section to either be bound individually or together, at the option of the mutual fund organization. There is no prohibition against the same Part B section of a multiple SP being bound by itself for distribution to some investors, and also being bound with the Part B section of other mutual funds for distribution to other investors.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(19) Section 3.2 of National Instrument 81-101 provides that the requirement under securities legislation to deliver a prospectus for a mutual fund will be satisfied by the delivery of a simplified prospectus, either with or without the documents incorporated by reference. Mutual fund organizations that bind separately the Part B sections of a multiple SP from the Part A section are reminded that, since a simplified prospectus consists of a Part A section and a Part B section, delivery of both sections is necessary in order to satisfy the delivery obligations in connection with the sale of securities of a particular mutual fund.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(20) In Items 1 through 4 of Part A of this Form, specific instructions are provided for a single SP and a multiple SP and in some cases for a multiple SP for which the Part A section is either bound with, or separate from, the Part B sections of the document. The remainder of Part A of this Form generally refers to disclosure required for "a mutual fund" in a "simplified prospectus". This disclosure should be modified as appropriate to reflect multiple mutual funds covered by a multiple SP.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Multi-Class Mutual Funds</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(21) A mutual fund that has more than one class or series that are referable to the same portfolio may treat each class or series as a separate mutual fund for purposes of this Form, or may combine disclosure of one or more of the classes or series in one simplified prospectus. If disclosure pertaining to more than one class or series is combined in one simplified prospectus, separate disclosure in response to each Item in this Form must be provided for each class or series unless the responses would be identical for each class or series.</in:em>
      </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(22) As provided in National Instrument 81-102, a section, part, class or series of a class of securities of a mutual fund that is referable to a separate portfolio of assets is considered to be a separate mutual fund. Those principles are applicable to National Instrument 81-101 and this Form.</in:em>

      <bcl:indent1>Provide a brief explanation, under the heading "What are your Legal Rights?", of an investor's statutory rights of rescission and damages, including the right of action for misrepresentations contained in the simplified prospectus and in any documents incorporated by reference into the simplified prospectus, in substantially the following words:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>Securities legislation in some provinces and territories gives you the right to withdraw from an agreement to buy mutual funds within two business days of receiving the Simplified Prospectus or Fund Facts, or to cancel your purchase within 48 hours of receiving confirmation of your order.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>Securities legislation in some provinces and territories also allows you to cancel an agreement to buy mutual fund [units/shares] and get your money back, or to make a claim for damages, if the Simplified Prospectus, Annual Information Form, Fund Facts or financial statements misrepresent any facts about the fund. These rights must usually be exercised within certain time limits.</bcl:indent2>

      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:em>(1) An example of a provision of securities legislation that may be relevant to this Item is the requirement contained in the conflict of interest provisions of the Canadian securities legislation of a number of jurisdictions to the effect that a mutual fund shall not make an investment in respect of which a related person will receive any fee or compensation except for fees paid pursuant to a contract disclosed in, among other things, a prospectus. Another example is the requirement of some jurisdictions that certain statements be included in a simplified prospectus of a mutual fund with a non-Canadian manager.</in:em>

    <bcl:indent1>(1) Under the heading "How has the fund performed?", include an introduction using wording substantially similar to the following:</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>This section tells you how [name of class/series of securities described in the fund facts document] [units/shares] of the fund have performed over the past [insert number of calendar years shown in the bar chart required under paragraph (2) (a)] years. Returns are after expenses have been deducted. These expenses reduce the fund's returns.</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent1>(2) Under the sub-heading "Year-by-year returns",</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>(a) provide a bar chart that shows the annual total return of the mutual fund, in chronological order with the most recent year on the right of the bar chart, for the lesser of</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent3>(i) each of the 10 most recently completed calendar years, and</bcl:indent3>
    <bcl:indent3>(ii) each of the completed calendar years in which the mutual fund has been in existence and which the mutual fund was a reporting issuer; and</bcl:indent3>
    <bcl:indent2>(b) include an introduction to the bar chart using wording substantially similar to the following:</bcl:indent2>
    <bcl:indent3>This chart shows how [name of class/series of securities described in the fund facts document] [units/shares] of the fund performed in each of the past [insert number of calendar years shown in the bar chart required under paragraph (a)]. The fund dropped in value in [for the particular years shown in the bar chart required under paragraph (a), insert the number of years in which the value of the mutual fund dropped] of the [insert number of calendar years shown in the bar chart required in paragraph (a)] years. The range of returns and change from year to year can help you assess how risky the fund has been in the past. It does not tell you how the fund will perform in the future.</bcl:indent3>
    <bcl:indent1>(3) Under the sub-heading "Best and worst 3-month returns",</bcl:indent1>
    <bcl:indent2>(a) provide information for the period covered in the bar chart required under paragraph (2) (a) in the form of the following table:</bcl:indent2>
