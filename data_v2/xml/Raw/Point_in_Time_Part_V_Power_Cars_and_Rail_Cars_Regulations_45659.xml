          <sectiontext>Every railway will be held responsible for the general condition of all power cars and rail car equipment under its control. The mechanical officer in charge at each point where repairs are done will be held responsible for the inspection and repair of all rail cars and appurtenances under his jurisdiction. He must know that all defects disclosed by any inspection are properly repaired before the equipment is returned to service. The safe working pressure of all pressure parts shall be fixed by the chief inspector of the ministry after full consideration has been given to design workmanship, age and condition.</sectiontext>
