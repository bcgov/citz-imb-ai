instrument or other document in the applicant's possession or in the
applicant's control in any capacity affecting the land covered by the
application or evidencing title to it.
Summons to produce instruments
160
The registrar may, by summons in the form approved by the director,
require a person to produce an instrument in the person's possession
or in the person's control in any capacity affecting land or a charge,
or evidencing the title to it, and, if the instrument is required to
complete registration, the registrar may require the person to deposit
the instrument.
Application to court to compel production or deposit of instruments
161
(1)
If a person summoned by the registrar to produce or deposit an
instrument or other document refuses or neglects to do so, the
registrar may apply to the Supreme Court, calling on the person to
appear and show cause why the person should not obey the summons.

If a person, after being served with notice of the application under
subsection (1), refuses or neglects to attend before the court at the

apprehended and brought before the court for examination, or
(b)
make any order that may be just.
Powers of court on hearing
162

The court may examine on oath the person summoned under
section 160 and, after the examination or in the person's
absence, may order the person to produce or deliver up the instrument
or other document requested by the registrar.
(2)
If the person summoned
(a)
refuses or neglects to comply with the order, or
(b)
cannot be found and the summons or warrant cannot be served on the
person,
the court may
(c)
direct the registrar to proceed with the application pending before
the registrar without the production of the instrument or other
document,
(d)
declare that the instrument or other document is deemed to be
cancelled, amended or endorsed, in whole or to the extent that the

it had been produced to the registrar on the application under section
161 (1), and
(e)
make any further order that the circumstances of the case may require.
Notice of intention to register
163
(1)
If an applicant is unable to comply with a requisition of the
registrar that a particular instrument or document, including an
absolute certificate of title, a duplicate indefeasible title or a
certificate of charge, be produced or deposited, because it is in the
possession of the registered owner or another person who refuses or
neglects to produce the instrument, the registrar may,
(a)
instead of proceeding under section 160, and
(b)
on being satisfied that the applicant has otherwise established a good
safe holding and marketable title to the land in question,
give notice in the form approved by the director to the person who has
possession of the instrument.
(2)
If a duplicate indefeasible title for land affected by an
expropriation notice is issued at the time the notice is filed, the
registrar must
(a)
cancel the duplicate indefeasible title, and
(b)
give notice of its cancellation to the person to whom it was delivered
at the person's address specified in section 176 (5)
and the registrar must not issue another duplicate indefeasible title
for the land until a vesting notice or notice of abandonment

Expropriation Act
.

The period stipulated in the notice in the approved form or an
extension of that period is in the discretion of the registrar.

Unless a good and valid objection in writing from the person served
with the notice is received within the period stipulated in the notice
or in an extension of it, the registrar may proceed with the
registration of the title claimed by the applicant.
(3)
If the title claimed is an estate in fee simple, an outstanding
absolute certificate of title or duplicate indefeasible title, the
nonproduction of which is mentioned in the notice, is deemed
conclusively to be cancelled as to the land so registered in the name
of the applicant.
Corporate powers assumed
165
(1)
For the purpose of this Act, a corporation, including a strata
corporation, is deemed to have the power and capacity of a natural
person of full capacity in acquiring and disposing of land despite a
stipulation, restriction or qualification expressed or imposed in any
other Act or law, charter or memorandum and articles of association of
the corporation, or in any other document.
(2)
Subsection (1) does not relieve a person who under an Act or law is
responsible for or in control of a corporation from liability for acts
of the corporation that, despite subsection (1), are beyond the powers
of the corporation.
(3)
If a corporation holds land in a fiduciary capacity,
subsection (1) is subject to section 180 and does not
(a)
extend the powers of the corporation in respect of that land, or
(b)
relieve the corporation or a person who by statute or law is
responsible for or in control of the corporation from liability to the
beneficiaries for an act of the corporation that is beyond its powers,
or is contrary to the trusts under which the corporation holds the
land.
(4)
Despite
(a)
any other Act or law,
(b)
the charter, memorandum, notice of articles and articles or other
constating documents of a corporation, or
(c)
any other document,
an instrument executed by a corporation is, in favour of all persons
dealing in good faith with the corporation, conclusively deemed to be
properly executed and the instrument takes effect accordingly if
(d)
the instrument is executed for the corporation by an individual whose
signature is represented in the instrument as the signature of an
authorized signatory of the corporation,
(e)
the execution of the instrument is witnessed or proved in accordance
with Part 5, and
(f)
in the case of a strata corporation, the instrument is accompanied by
a Certificate of Strata Corporation in the prescribed form under the
Strata Property Act
stating that the execution of the instrument has been approved by a
resolution at an annual or special general meeting in accordance with
the requirements of the
Strata Property Act
, and that the instrument conforms to the resolution.
(5)
The registrar may accept the signature of an officer under Part 5 or
an affidavit under section 49 as sufficient evidence that a
corporation existed at the time an instrument was executed by it, or
the registrar may require further evidence of that fact.
Disposal of instruments deposited
166
(1)
Subject to subsection (3), all instruments and other documents
deposited with the registrar must remain on deposit in the land title
office or in some other location approved by the Board of Directors.
(2)
If an application to register or deposit an instrument is refused by
the registrar or withdrawn, the instrument produced in support of the
application must be returned to the applicant.
(3)
An instrument or other document may be destroyed if
(a)
there is a duplicate, as defined in section 38, of the instrument or
other document,
(b)
the instrument or other document has no significant historical value,
and
(c)
the destruction is authorized by the bylaws of the Land Title and
Survey Authority.
Withdrawal of application
167
(1)
If an application has been made, and no other pending application is
affected by it, the applicant may withdraw the application as to all
or a part of the land comprised in it at any time before registration,
on terms the registrar considers proper.
(2)
If the person making the application is
(a)
an agent who is not a solicitor, or notary public under the
Notaries Act
, or
(b)
one of several owners acting on behalf of the person and the other
owners,
the registrar may refuse to allow the applicant to withdraw the
application until the applicant produces the written consent, properly
verified, of the applicant's principal or, as the case may be, the
other owners.
(3)
If a caveat has been lodged contesting the applicant's right to
registration, the registrar may refuse to allow the application to be
withdrawn until the applicant has paid the caveator a sum the Supreme
Court on application may set, and the court may, by order, direct the
applicant to pay reasonable compensation for the costs and expenses to
which the caveator has been put because of the application.
(4)
An application that has been withdrawn is void.
Summary rejection of defective application
168
(1)
The registrar may cause an application and an instrument or other
document presented with it
(a)
to undergo a preliminary inspection, or
(b)
to be received without preliminary inspection.

An application may be summarily rejected if, in a preliminary
inspection under this section,
(a)
the instrument or other document
(i)
does not qualify in substance and in form for registration, filing or
deposit,
(ii)
is not on sufficiently durable paper,
(iii)
is illegible in any respect, including the signature of a witness or
an official authorized to take an affidavit,

of being scanned and stored electronically using equipment in the land
title office,
(b)
the supporting application or other document is incomplete or not in
proper form, or

(3)
Whether or not there has been a preliminary inspection, the
application is received when the registrar has complied with
section 153.

Every application received must be examined without delay and, except
for an application to register a certificate of pending litigation or
to lodge a caveat, must be given consideration in order of its
receipt.
