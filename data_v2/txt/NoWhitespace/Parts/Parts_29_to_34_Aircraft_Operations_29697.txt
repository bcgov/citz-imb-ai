connection to the helmet shell,
(c)
is secured in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer
of the headgear, and
(d)
meets the requirements of one or more of the following standards:

Maximum arrest force, clearance
34.15
(1)
In this section,
"maximum arrest force"
means the peak shock load that a rope access system imposes on the
body of a person connected to the rope access system when stopping the
person's fall.
(2)
A rope access system must
(a)
limit the maximum arrest force to not more than 6 kN (1 350 lbf), and
(b)
minimize the risk of a person connected to the rope access system
striking a lower surface or object, or swinging and striking a surface
or object, in a manner that could cause injury.
[en. B.C. Reg. 199/2014, App. K, s. 2.]
Removal from service
34.16
(1)
Equipment used for a rope access system must be removed from service
(a)
as specified by the manufacturer of the equipment, or
(b)
if the equipment is defective.
(2)
Equipment that is removed from service must not be returned to service
until it has been inspected and recertified, by the manufacturer or a
professional engineer, as meeting the requirements of section 34.9.
