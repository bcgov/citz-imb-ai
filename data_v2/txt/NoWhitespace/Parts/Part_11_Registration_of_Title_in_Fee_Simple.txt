Part 11 — Registration of Title in Fee Simple
Division 1 — First Registration
Registration of title
169
(1)
If an application is made for the registration of indefeasible title
to land, the registrar must register the title claimed by the
applicant, if the registrar is satisfied that
(a)
the boundaries of the land are sufficiently defined by the description
or plan on record in the land title office or provided by the
applicant, and
(b)
a good safe holding and marketable title in fee simple has been
established by the applicant.
(2)
If the registrar considers it advisable, the registrar may, before
registration under subsection (1), direct that a person named by the
registrar be served with notice of the registrar's intention to
register the title of the applicant at the expiration of a period set
in the notice unless within that period the person served lodges a
caveat or registers a certificate of pending litigation contesting the
applicant's right to registration.
(3)
If a caveat is lodged or a certificate of pending litigation is
registered under subsection (2), the registrar must defer
consideration of the application until the caveat expires or is
withdrawn or the adverse claim is disposed of.
Requirements as to production of title deeds
170
On an application for the registration of title in favour of an owner
in fee simple, a mortgagee, or other person entitled by right to the
possession of documents of title, the registrar must require the
person applying to be registered as owner in fee simple, as mortgagee
or otherwise, to produce all title deeds of the land to which the
registration is intended to refer unless their nonproduction is
satisfactorily explained to the registrar by means of an affidavit.
Adverse possession
171
An application founded in whole or in part on adverse possession must
not be accepted by the registrar unless permitted by this Act and
supported by a declaration of title under the
Land Title Inquiry Act
.
First estate of inheritance necessary to registration of fee simple
172
If 2 or more persons are owners of different estates or interests in
the same land, by way of remainder or otherwise,
(a)
the first owner of an estate of inheritance must be registered as the
owner of the fee simple but, in the register, the owner of the estate
of inheritance must not be shown to be possessed of a larger or
different estate from that to which the owner of the estate of
inheritance is by law entitled, and
(b)
the estates or interests of the other owners must be registered by way
of a charge according to their priority.
Several persons interested in registration
173
The registrar may effect registration of the fee simple at the
instance of a joint tenant or tenant in common, or of several persons,
who together are entitled to the complement of the fee simple.
Application to convert absolute fee into indefeasible title
174
(1)
The registered owner of the absolute fee of land under the Acts
repealed by the former Act may apply in writing to the registrar for
registration of indefeasible title to the land and the application
must be in the form approved by the director.
(2)
Section 158 applies to this section.
(3)
The registrar, on the registrar's own initiative, in respect of any
land in the absolute fees register, may convert the absolute fee into
an indefeasible title without an application from the registered owner
of the absolute fee.
Division 2 — The Register and Duplicate Indefeasible Titles
Register and records
175
(1)
The registrar must keep a register and enter or store in it
(a)
all indefeasible titles and all matters required under this Act to be
registered or entered on an indefeasible title and affecting land
included in it, and
(b)
any other matter required by the director.
(2)
The registrar may remove records of indefeasible titles from the
register where they were required to be kept or stored, and on removal
those records may be kept in a manner and for a period that the
director may direct.
(3)
The registrar may convert existing records in a land title office,
including records of indefeasible titles, into another form in order
to facilitate computerization of those records, and on conversion the
substituted form must, for all purposes, be accepted and received as
the original record.
(4)
If a record is converted under subsection (3), evidence of the
original record must be preserved among the records of the land title
office.
(5)
The registrar may duplicate any record in a land title office in the
form and manner directed by the director and, if an original record so
duplicated becomes lost, damaged, destroyed or not immediately
available for use, the registrar may declare that the duplicate has
the same effect as the original.
(6)
The registrar may remove from the register any record that has been
cancelled if the registrar retains evidence of it.
(7)
The registrar may establish, keep and maintain the register, books and
indices required for the purpose of this Act by any means, whether
chemical, electronic, mechanical or otherwise.
Duplicate indefeasible title
176
(1)
The registrar must, on the written application of the registered owner
in fee simple of land that is not subject to a registered mortgage or
agreement for sale, issue a certificate to be known as a duplicate
indefeasible title.
(2)
A duplicate indefeasible title must contain all information contained
in the register respecting the indefeasible title to the land in
question together with all conditions, exceptions and reservations,
charges, liens or interests to which the title of the applicant is
subject.

A duplicate indefeasible title must be in the form approved by the
director and must be certified by the registrar as an accurate
statement of the information referred to in subsection (2) as it is
stored in the register.
(4)
The registrar must endorse a note in the register that the duplicate
indefeasible title has been issued, and the registrar must not issue a
second duplicate indefeasible title until the first one has been
cancelled or deemed to be cancelled.
(5)
The registrar may deliver a duplicate indefeasible title
(a)
by mailing it to the person who made the application or the person
named in the application for that purpose at the person's address set
out in the application, or
(b)
by personal delivery to that person, in which case the person to whom
it is personally delivered must sign a receipt for it.
(6)
Unless the registrar otherwise directs, a duplicate indefeasible title
that is returned to a land title office is cancelled, whether or not a
note of the cancellation is made on it.
Registration of joint tenants
177
If, on the registration of the title to land under an instrument or
document, 2 or more persons are joint tenants, the registrar must
enter in the register, following the names, addresses and occupations
of those persons, the words "joint tenants".
Division 3 — General
Limitation on number of parcels
178
(1)
Despite section 158 (1), an indefeasible title must not cover more
than one parcel unless the registrar permits a greater number to be
covered.

A registrar may require an application under section 158 (1) to be
limited to the number of parcels that can be covered by an
indefeasible title under subsection (1).
(3)
The registrar may cancel an indefeasible title that covers more than
one parcel and substitute in its place a single indefeasible title for
each parcel that was covered by the cancelled title or any other
combination that the registrar sees fit.
Rights of owner of surface
179
(1)
Except as provided in the
Strata Property Act
and in Part 9, the owner of the surface of land is alone entitled to
be or remain as registered owner of the fee simple, and the owner of a
part of land above or below its surface who is not also the owner of
the surface is only entitled to register that person's estate or
interest as a charge.
(2)
If no Crown grant of the surface has been registered, the registrar
may enter the Crown in the register as owner of the surface.
(3)
If the title of an owner to certain minerals or to certain timber or
to an undivided interest in them is registered in the register of
absolute fees and the owner applies to become the registered owner of
other minerals or other timber in the same land or a further undivided
interest in the minerals or timber, the registrar must
(a)
consolidate the ownership of the minerals or timber or the interests
in them, and register the title to them as a single charge in the
register of indefeasible fees, subject to registered charges, if any,
affecting that title, and
(b)
cancel the entry in the register of absolute fees, together with any
outstanding absolute certificate of title.
Recognition of trust estates
180
(1)
If land vests in a personal representative or a trustee, that person's
title may be registered, but particulars of a trust created or
declared in respect of that land must not be entered in the register.
(2)
In effecting registration in the name of a personal representative,
the registrar must add, following the name and address of the personal
representative, an endorsement containing any additional information
that the registrar considers necessary to identify the estate of the
testate or intestate and a reference by number to the trust
instrument.
(3)
In effecting registration in the name of a trustee, the registrar must
add, following the name and address of the trustee, an endorsement
containing the words "in trust" and a reference by number to the trust
instrument.
(4)
The trust instrument must be filed with the registrar with the
application for registration of title.
(5)
If an instrument, other than a will, creating or declaring a trust has
been executed outside British Columbia, and also affects or deals with
land or other property outside British Columbia, or the trusts of the
instrument are being administered outside British Columbia, the
registrar,
(a)
on satisfactory proof of the facts and that the original instrument is
required for use outside British Columbia, and
(b)
on production of the original or a copy certified by the officer in
charge of the public record office in which the original is filed,
may accept for filing the certified copy, or a copy that the registrar
has compared with the original and certified as a true copy.
(6)
A copy certified under subsection (5) has the same effect as the
original.
(7)
If an endorsement has been made in the register under subsection (2)
or (3), an instrument purporting to transfer, mortgage or otherwise
deal with the land must not be registered unless
(a)
expressly authorized by law or by the instrument creating or declaring
the trust, or
(b)
an order has been obtained from the Supreme Court construing the
instrument as authorizing the transfer, mortgage or other dealing, or
ordering and directing the transfer, mortgage or other dealing, and a
certified copy of the order has been filed with the registrar.
(8)
Subsection (7) does not apply to a dealing in land by the Public
Guardian and Trustee.
(9)
If
(a)
a registered owner appears on the face of the register to be
beneficially entitled to land, and
(b)
from an instrument creating or declaring a trust, it is established to
the satisfaction of the registrar that the registered owner was at the
time that person became registered and the person still is a trustee
on the trusts set out in the instrument,
the registrar,
(c)
on application, may make an endorsement in the register similar to
that required under subsection (3) and of the date on which it is
made, or
(d)
if, in the registrar's opinion, the circumstances require, may
register a new indefeasible title in the name of the trustee.
(10)
If registration has been completed in accordance with this section and
an instrument produced and filed is effective
(a)
to modify the terms or conditions of the trust, or
(b)
for the purpose of evidencing an alteration of or among the
beneficiaries by operation of law, or on the happening of an event
contemplated by the trust instrument, and not being a transfer or
assignment of the rights of a beneficiary made while the transferor or
assignor is living,
the registrar, on application, may add to the existing endorsement a
note of the fact of the modification or alteration and of the filing
number of the instrument.
Interest or right reserved to transferor
181

On an application to register a person as owner in fee simple of land
under an instrument by which
(a)
an estate or interest in the land transferred remains in the
transferor,
(b)
a restrictive covenant is entered into by the transferee for the
benefit of other land registered in the name of the transferor, or
(c)
a condition, exception, reservation, easement, statutory right of way
or other right in or on the land covered by the application is
imposed, reserved or created that, despite this section, could be
registered as a charge under section 197,
the existing indefeasible title must be cancelled and the estate or
interest remaining in, and the rights reserved to the transferor or
imposed or created must, on application, be registered as a charge
against the new indefeasible title.
(2)
The applicant for the registration of the fee simple is authorized to
make, on behalf of a transferor, any application necessary to give
effect to subsection (1).
Registration of restrictive covenants and easements
182

If a restrictive covenant, an easement, a party wall agreement as
defined in section 223.1, or other incorporeal right is entered into
or created for the purpose of being annexed to other land, hereinafter
referred to as the dominant tenement, for which an indefeasible title
has been registered, the registrar must make an endorsement of the
covenant, easement, party wall agreement as defined in section 223.1,
or right, and of the instrument creating it, against the indefeasible
title of the dominant tenement.
(2)
A transfer of the land covered by an indefeasible title on which an
endorsement under subsection (1) has been made transfers, without
express mention, the benefit of the covenant, easement, agreement or
right.
Entries carried forward from original entry
183
If a condition, exception, reservation, charge, lien or interest is
carried forward from a former folio in the register to a new
certificate of title, the new entry in the register has the same
effect as the original entry, and for all purposes dates from the time
when it was originally made in the register.
Registration of grantor a condition precedent
184
If the person purporting to transfer an estate in fee simple in land
is alive and entitled to be registered as the owner in fee simple, the
person to whom the transfer purports to be made must not be registered
under it unless the person so purporting to transfer the estate is
first registered as the owner in fee simple.
