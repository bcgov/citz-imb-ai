Specifying Crown land as a designated area
169
(1)
The Lieutenant Governor in Council, by regulation, may

170
(1)
In this section,

(2)
If a permit, licence or plan referred to in subsection (3) relates to
all or part of a designated area, the minister, by written order, may

(b)
direct a person who, under this Act, the
Forest and Range Practices Act
or the
Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act
, has a discretion to issue the permit, licence or plan
(i)
to not issue the permit, licence or plan, or
(ii)
in whole or in part, to issue the permit, licence or plan with terms
and conditions, if any, that the person considers appropriate to take
into account the relationship of the permit, licence or plan to the
designated area.
(3)
The following are the permits, licences or plans to which subsection
(2) applies:

If a permit, licence or plan is suspended or varied under subsection
(2) (a) and the Crown land to which the suspension or variation
relates ceases to be a designated area, the minister may, by order,
(a)
restore the permit, licence or plan, in whole or in part, and
(b)
extend the term of the permit, licence or plan, as that permit,
licence or plan relates to the area that has ceased to be a designated
area.
(4.1)
The period of time by which the minister may extend the term of the
permit, licence or plan under subsection (4) (b) must not exceed
the period of time that remained on the term of the permit, licence or
plan as at the effective date of the suspension or variation.
(5)
If a person who, under this Act, the
Forest and Range Practices Act
or the
Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act
, has a discretion to issue a permit, licence or plan, in this
subsection called the "issuing authority",
(a)
receives an application for the permit or licence or receives a plan
submitted for approval, whether before, on or after the date of an
order of the minister making a direction referred to in subsection (2)
(b), and
(b)
by reason only of the direction,
(i)
does not issue the permit, licence or plan, or
(ii)
in whole or in part, issues the permit, licence or plan as permitted
under subsection (2) (b) (ii),
then, subject to subsection (6), after the Crown land to which the
direction pertains ceases to be a designated area, or after an earlier
date, if any, ordered in writing by the minister, the issuing
authority must issue the permit, licence or plan, or, in the case of
one previously issued as authorized under subsection (2) (b) (ii),
must amend the permit, licence or plan to give effect as nearly as
practicable to the original application or submission.
(6)
The requirement in subsection (5) that a permit, licence or plan be
issued, or amended to give effect as nearly as practicable to the

authority
(a)
continuing to have the discretion to carry out that requirement, and
(b)
receiving confirmation from the applicant or from the person that
submitted the plan that the applicant or person wishes to proceed.
(7)
In issuing or amending a permit, licence or plan under subsection (5)
the person who has the discretion may include terms and conditions
that the person with the discretion considers necessary or desirable
in the circumstances.
(8)
The minister, by written order, may vary a variance, suspension or
direction made under subsection (2).
(9)
The minister must serve a copy of an order made under subsection (2),
(4), (5) or (8) on the holder of
(a)
an agreement, and
(b)
a special use permit
to which the order relates, but the order is not invalid only because
it is not served.

date, if any, ordered in writing by the minister.
(3)
The minister, by written order, may vary a condition made under this
section.
(4)

Suspension and cancellation
172
(1)
If a permit, licence or plan is varied under section 170, the

comply with the variance is grounds for a suspension under
section 76, in whole or in part, of the agreement to which the
permit, licence or plan relates.
(2)
If under section 171 a condition is attached to an agreement, the
failure of the holder of the agreement to comply with the condition is
grounds for a suspension under section 76, in whole or in part,
of the agreement.
(3)
If a special use permit is varied under section 170 or has a condition
attached to it under section 171, the failure of the holder of the

suspension or cancellation of the permit and sections 76 to 77, other
than section 77 (5), apply to the suspension or cancellation.
Allowable annual cut and allowable harvest in a designated area
173
(1)
[Repealed 2021-38-59.]
(2)
The chief forester, by written order, may reduce the allowable annual
cut of
(a)
a timber supply area, or
(b)
a tree farm licence area,
if all or part of the area is a designated area.
(2.1)
An allowable annual cut reduction under subsection (2)
(a)
for the designated area to which it relates, may be made effective on
or after the date the designated area is specified under section 169
(1), and
(b)
may specify that portions of the reduction are attributable to
different types of timber and terrain in different parts of Crown land
within the designated area.
(3)
If the allowable annual cut of a timber supply area is reduced under
subsection (2), the minister may distribute all or part of the
reduction among the forest licences in the timber supply area in
accordance with section 63 (2) and, for this purpose, section
63 (4) applies.
(3.1)
An allowable annual cut reduction under subsection (3) may be made
effective on or after the date on which the chief forester's order to
which it relates is made or is made effective.
(4) and (5)
[Repealed 2021-38-59.]
(6)
The minister, by written order, may reduce the allowable annual cut
authorized for a community forest agreement area, first nations
woodland licence area or woodlot licence area if all or part of the
area is a designated area.
(6.1)
An allowable annual cut reduction under subsection (6), for the
designated area to which it relates, may be made effective on or after
the date the designated area is specified under section 169 (1).
(7)
If the chief forester or minister makes an order under
subsection (2), (3) or (6) that affects a timber supply
area, a forest licence or the licence area of an area-based licence
and, after the order is made, a determination or reduction is made
under section 8 or 63 that establishes a new allowable
annual cut for the timber supply area, forest licence or licence area
of the area-based licence, the chief forester or minister, as the case
may be, may issue a new order under subsection (2), (3)
or (6) that affects the area or licence.
(8)
The chief forester or minister, as the case may be, must serve a copy
of an order made under this section on the holder of an agreement to
which the order relates, but the order is not invalid only because it
is not served.
(9)
An order under subsection (2), (3), (6) or (7) expires when the Crown
land it relates to ceases to be a designated area.
(10)
After an order expires under subsection (9), the allowable annual cut
for the timber supply area, forest licence or licence area of the
area-based licence that was affected by the order is the allowable
annual cut that was in effect immediately before the last order made
under this section less any reductions made under this Act or the
licence, other than reductions made under this section, during the
period that the order was in effect.
(11)
[Repealed 2000-6-19.]
Effect of reduction on annual allowable cut determination
173.1
(1)
Neither a reduction in allowable annual cut under section 173 (2), nor
a restoration of an allowable annual cut under section 173 (10),
constitutes a determination of an allowable annual cut for the

Section 8 does not apply to a reduction of an allowable annual cut
under section 173.
(3)
If an allowable annual cut of a timber supply area or tree farm
licence area is reduced under section 173, the chief forester is not
required to make an allowable annual cut determination under section 8
(1) in respect of those areas at the times set out in section 8 (1) or
(2) (c) or (d), but must make that determination within 2 years after
the designated area to which the reduction applies ceases to be a
designated area.
Order prevails
174
If an order made in accordance with this Part conflicts or is
inconsistent with
(a)
this Act, the
Forest and Range Practices Act
, the
Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act
, the
Wildfire Act
or any regulations or standards made under those Acts,
(b)
an agreement, or
(c)
a permit, licence or plan listed in section 170 (3),
the order prevails.
Hearing not required
175
An order may be made under this Part without a hearing.

(a)
the volume of the harvested timber had been equal to the amount by
which the allowable annual cut of the agreement is reduced under
section 173,
