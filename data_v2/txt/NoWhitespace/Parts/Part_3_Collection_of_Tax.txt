Payments on account
70
(1)
A collection agreement may provide that if any payment is received by
the federal minister on account of tax payable by a taxpayer for a
taxation year under this Act, the federal Act or an income tax statute
of another agreeing province, or under any 2 or more of those
statutes, the payment received may be applied by the federal minister
toward the tax payable by the taxpayer under any of the statutes in
the manner specified in the agreement, even though the taxpayer
directed that the payment be applied in any other manner or made no
direction for its application.
(2)
Any payment or part of it applied by the federal minister under a
collection agreement toward the tax payable by a taxpayer for a
taxation year under this Act
(a)
relieves the taxpayer of liability to pay the tax to the extent of the
payment, and
(b)
is deemed to have been applied in accordance with a direction made by
the taxpayer.
No action against persons withholding tax
71
If a collection agreement is in effect and an amount is remitted to
the Receiver General for Canada under section 153 (1) of the federal
Act, as it applies for the purposes of this Act, on account of the tax
of an individual who is resident on the last day of the taxation year
in another agreeing province,
(a)
no action lies for recovery of the amount by that individual, and
(b)
the amount may not be applied in discharge of any liability of that
individual under this Act.
Relief of taxpayer
72
(1)
If a collection agreement is entered into, an individual resident in
British Columbia on the last day of the taxation year is not required
to remit any amount on account of tax payable by the individual under
this Act for the taxation year to the extent of the amount deducted or
withheld on account of the individual's tax for that year under the
income tax statute of another agreeing province.
(2)
If the total amount deducted or withheld on account of tax payable
under this Act and under the income tax statute of another agreeing
province by an individual resident in British Columbia on the last day
of the taxation year to whom subsection (1) applies exceeds the tax
payable by the individual under this Act for that year, section 40 of
this Act applies to the individual as though the excess were an
overpayment under this Act.
Non-agreeing provinces
73
(1)
In this section:
"adjusting payment"
means a payment, calculated under this section, made by or on the
direction of British Columbia to a non-agreeing province;
"amount deducted or withheld"
does not include any refund made in respect of that amount;
"non-agreeing province"
means a province that is not an agreeing province.
(2)
If, in respect of a taxation year, a non-agreeing province is
authorized to make a payment to British Columbia that, in the opinion
of the finance minister, corresponds to an adjusting payment, the
Lieutenant Governor in Council may authorize the finance minister to
make an adjusting payment to that non-agreeing province and enter into
any agreement that may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this
section.
(3)
If a collection agreement is entered into, the adjusting payment that
may be made under subsection (2) may be made by the government of
Canada if it has agreed to act on the direction of British Columbia as
communicated by the finance minister to the federal minister.
(4)
The adjusting payment to be made under this section is an amount that
equals the aggregate of the amounts deducted or withheld under section
153 (1) of the federal Act, as it applies for the purposes of this
Act, in respect of the tax payable for a taxation year by individuals
who
(a)
file returns under the federal Act,
(b)
are taxable under that Act for that year, and
(c)
are resident on the last day of that year in the non-agreeing province
to which the adjusting payment is to be made.
(5)
If an adjusting payment is to be made and there has been an amount
deducted or withheld under section 153 (1) of the federal Act, as it
applies for the purposes of this Act, on account of the tax for a
taxation year of an individual who is taxable under the federal Act in
respect of that year and who is resident on the last day of that
taxation year in the non-agreeing province,
(a)
no action lies for the recovery of the amount by that individual, and
(b)
the amount may not be applied in discharge of any liability of that
individual under this Act.
(6)
If an adjusting payment to a non-agreeing province is to be made under
this section for a taxation year, an individual resident in British
Columbia on the last day of the taxation year is not required to remit
any amount on account of tax payable by the individual under this Act
for the taxation year to the extent of the amount deducted or withheld
on account of the individual's income tax for that year under the law
of that non-agreeing province.
(7)
If an adjusting payment to a non-agreeing province is to be made under
this section for a taxation year, the total amount deducted or
withheld on account of tax payable under this Act and on account of
the income tax payable under the law of the non-agreeing province by
an individual resident in British Columbia on the last day of the
taxation year to whom subsection (6) applies exceeds the tax payable
by the individual under this Act for that year, section 40 of this Act
applies to the individual as though the excess were an overpayment
under this Act.
(8)
If a collection agreement is entered into and the government of Canada
has agreed in respect of a taxation year to carry out the direction of
British Columbia and to make an adjusting payment on behalf of British
Columbia, the adjusting payment
(a)
must be made out of any money that has been collected on account of
tax under this Act for any taxation year, and
(b)
is the amount calculated by the federal minister to be the amount
required to be paid under subsection (4).
(9)
The adjusting payment under subsection (8) discharges any obligation
the government of Canada may have to pay British Columbia for any
amount deducted or withheld under section 153 (1) of the federal Act,
as it applies for the purposes of this Act, to which subsection (5) of
this section applies.
Enforcement of judgments
74
(1)
Despite the
Court Order Enforcement Act
, if a collection agreement is entered into, a judgment of a superior
court of an agreeing province under that province's income tax
statute, including any certificate registered in that superior court
in a manner similar to that provided in section 223 (3) of the federal
Act, as it applies for the purposes of this Act, may be enforced in
the manner provided in section 223 of the federal Act, as it applies
for the purposes of this Act, by registering a copy of the judgment or
certificate, certified by the registrar of the proper superior court.
(2)
The registered judgment or certificate referred to in subsection (1)
is deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be a judgment of the
Supreme Court.
