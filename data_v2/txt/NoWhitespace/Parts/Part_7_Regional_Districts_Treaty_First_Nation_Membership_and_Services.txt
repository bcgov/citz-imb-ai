Part 7 â€” Regional Districts: Treaty First Nation Membership and Services
Treaty first nation membership in regional district
250
(1)
If a final agreement provides for the membership of the treaty first
nation in a regional district,

as a member as if the treaty first nation were a municipality in the
regional district, and

duties and obligations, as modified by this Part, as a municipal
director.

For certainty, to the extent that the
Community Charter
applies to a regional district of which a treaty first nation is a
member or to a director as a member of the board, the
Community Charter
applies to the treaty first nation as a member of the regional
district and to the treaty first nation director as a member of the
board.
