Conversion schedule
273
(1)
The conversion schedule must meet any requirements as to form and
content that are required by this Act and the regulations, and must do
all of the following:
(a)
state whether the strata corporation holds land in its name, or has
land held on its behalf, that is not shown on the strata plan;
(b)
identify land shown on the strata plan and land held in the name of or

list the name and postal address of each owner and registered charge
holder of the land;
(d)
list all registered interests in the land
(i)
as they exist at the time of the resolution, and

as they will exist if the registrar grants an order and the owners
become tenants in common in shares calculated according to the
following formula:
(2)
If there is no assessed value for the owner's strata lot or for any
strata lot in the strata plan, an appraised value
(a)
that has been determined by an independent appraiser, and

was required under section 4 (g) of the
Condominium Act
, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 64, or a similar schedule that was required under

days after the resolution is passed.

from applying under subsection (1) (a) or affect the validity of a
winding-up resolution.

person who may be affected by the order sought under subsection (1)

or not confirmed, of
(i)
significant unfairness to one or more
