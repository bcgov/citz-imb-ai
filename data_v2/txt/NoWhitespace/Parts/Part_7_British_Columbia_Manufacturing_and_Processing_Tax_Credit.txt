or in the 10 taxation years immediately preceding, or the 2 years
immediately following, the taxation year.
(3)
For the purposes of this section, the following rules apply:
(a)
the capital cost to a corporation of a property is to be computed as
if no amount were added to that cost by virtue of section 21 of the
federal Act;
(b)
the capital cost to a corporation of a property is deemed to be the
capital cost to the corporation of the property determined without
applying section 13 (7.1) and (7.4) of the federal Act, less the
amount of any government assistance, or non-government assistance,
(i)
that can reasonably be considered to be in respect of, or for the
acquisition of, the property, and

that, at the time of the filing of the corporation's return of income
for the taxation year in which the property was acquired, the
corporation has received, is entitled to receive or can reasonably be
expected to receive;
(c)
if a corporation has acquired property from a person with whom the
corporation was not dealing at arm's length at an amount in excess of
the fair market value of the property at the time the corporation so
acquired it, the corporation is deemed to have acquired it at that
fair market value;
(d)
if at a particular time a corporation that is a member of a
partnership has received, is entitled to receive or can reasonably be
expected to receive government assistance or non-government
assistance, the amount of assistance that can reasonably be considered
to be in respect of, or for the acquisition of, depreciable property
of the partnership is deemed to have been received at that time by the
partnership as government assistance or non-government assistance in
respect of the property.
Partnerships
106
(1)
If, in a particular taxation year of a qualifying corporation that is
a member of a partnership, an amount would, if the partnership were a
qualifying corporation, be determined in respect of the partnership
under section 105 (2) (a), (c) or (e) for a taxation year ending in
the particular taxation year, the appropriate portion of that amount
must be added in computing the corporation's tax credit under this
Part at the end of that particular taxation year.
(2)
For the purposes of this section, the appropriate portion of the
amount referred to in subsection (1) is that portion that may
reasonably be considered to be the corporation's share of the tax
credit.
(3)
If the corporation is a limited partner in the partnership at the end
of the partnership's taxation year, the portion that under subsection
(2) may reasonably be considered to be the corporation's share of the
tax credit is to be determined by applying section 127 (8.1) to (8.5)
of the federal Act, except that, in addition to any other
modifications required by the circumstances,
(a)
section 127 (8.1) and (8.3) (a) is to be read as though it did not
include any reference to paragraph (a.1) of the definition of
"investment tax credit" in section 127 (9) of the federal Act,
(b)
section 127 (8.2) (b) (i) is to be read without reference to clause
(B), and
(c)
section 127 (8.2) (b) (i) (A) is to be read as though the reference to
"a specified percentage" were to "3%".

under section 29 to file its return of income for a taxation year, the
corporation may renounce all or part of the tax credit with respect to
a qualified property acquired by the corporation in the taxation year.
(2)
If a qualifying corporation renounces its entitlement to all or part
of a tax credit under subsection (1), the corporation is deemed for
all purposes never to have been entitled to receive, or have had a
reasonable expectation of receiving, that credit or part of it.
Amalgamations and wind ups
108
(1)
If a new corporation is formed by the amalgamation of 2 or more
corporations, the new corporation is deemed to be the same corporation
as, and a continuation of, each of its predecessor corporations for
the purposes of applying this Part to the new corporation, except that
this provision does not affect the determination of the tax payable by
any predecessor corporation.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), if a new corporation is formed by the
amalgamation of a particular corporation and one or more of its
subsidiary wholly owned corporations within the meaning of section 87
(1.4) of the federal Act, the new corporation is deemed to be the same
corporation as, and a continuation of, the particular corporation for
the purposes of applying this Part to the particular corporation.
(3)
If a subsidiary corporation is wound up, within the meaning of section
88 (1) of the federal Act, the parent corporation is deemed to be the
same corporation as, and a continuation of, the subsidiary corporation
for the purposes of applying this Part to the parent corporation.
