Surveyor to act under minister
330
The surveyor in charge of the special survey must make the survey and
plan under the guidance and instruction of the minister and within
whatever period of time may be prescribed by the minister.
Preliminary procedure
331
The surveyor must proceed to retrace the existing outside boundaries
of the land described in the order for the special survey, and must
report on that to the minister either
(a)
that the boundaries are well defined and there is no danger of contest
arising with owners outside and adjacent to the special survey area,
in which event the surveyor must proceed with the survey without
further directions, or
(b)
that the boundaries are uncertain and there is danger of a conflict,
and, if the circumstances warrant, that a conflict may be avoided or
minimized by including in the survey further adjacent land.
Supplemental order or direction of minister
332
On receipt of a report in the terms of section 331 (b) the minister
may either
(a)
make a supplemental order extending the boundaries of the special
survey area to include the land, if any, recommended by the surveyor,
and then the order must apply to that land as fully and effectually as
if it had been included in the original limits of the special survey,
or
(b)
direct the surveyor to provide a plan of the external boundaries of
the special survey area either as originally defined or as including
the adjacent land recommended by the surveyor, or of that portion of
the external boundaries as is in doubt, in which case the surveyor
must provide a plan showing the adjacent parcels of land, the owners
of which would be affected by the final adoption of the boundary lines
recommended by the surveyor,
and in any event may amend the termination date of the period within
which the survey is to be made if a period has been prescribed under
section 330.
Procedure for fixing boundary of survey area
333
(1)
On receipt of a plan provided under section 332 (b), the minister must
deposit a copy with the proper officer and in the land title office,
and the proper officer must give to the registered owner of each
parcel adjacent to the boundary line shown on the plan, and to each
registered owner of a charge on it, and to another person, as directed
by the minister, a notice in writing stating that the plan has been
deposited, and that the line as shown on it will be adopted as the
boundary line between the special survey area and the adjacent land,
and that the interests of the person to whom the notice is directed
are affected by the survey, and setting a time and place for the
hearing of any complaint that may be made against the adoption of the
line as the boundary of the special survey area, and thereafter the
procedure under section 344 and following sections, in regard to the
filing of objections and hearing, must be followed as far as
applicable and with the necessary changes, and the minister must, by
supplemental order, fix as the boundary of the special survey area
either the line recommended by the surveyor or any other line which on
the evidence before the minister appears as the proper boundary.
(2)
The line fixed finally determines the boundary between the land in the
special survey area and adjacent land, and if any damages or
compensation are awarded to the registered owners of land outside the
special survey area they form part of and must be paid out of the same
fund as the expenses of the survey.
Transmittal of copy of supplemental order to proper officer and
registrar
334
(1)
If a supplemental order is made under either section 332 or 333,
a certified copy of it must be transmitted to the proper officer, who
must give to registered owners of land in the added area the same
notice as is called for by section 329.
(2)
A certified copy of the supplemental order must also be transmitted to
the registrar.
Guiding principles for surveyor
335
(1)
In making the survey the surveyor must re-establish as nearly as
possible the existing survey, but the surveyor may depart from
existing boundaries in order to establish boundaries in agreement with
occupation and improvements.
(2)
The surveyor must endeavour to make adjustments that will reduce the
total amount of compensation to a minimum and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing provisions, the surveyor may in particular
distribute any shortage in area within a block or group of parcels,
having regard to occupation and improvements, and may similarly allot
a surplus to a registered owner willing to pay compensation, or create
a separate parcel to be disposed of for the reduction of the cost and
expenses of the survey.
Nature of survey
336
(1)
The surveyor must limit the survey to a block outline survey where the
survey would accomplish the object of the special survey, but where a
block outline survey would not have that effect the surveyor must make
an effective survey which may be in part a complete survey and in part
a block outline survey, as the surveyor thinks advisable.
(2)
The surveyor must, on written request of the registered owner of a
parcel, preferred while the survey is in progress, make a complete
survey of that parcel, and the additional cost occasioned by it must
be borne by the registered owner and charged against the land affected
on the completion of the survey.
Plans
337
(1)
In preparing a special survey plan the surveyor must show on it the
boundaries of all parcels with their dimensions, although the surveyor
has not actually run the boundaries on the ground.
(2)
Where lines have been run and monuments established the location of
them must be shown on the plan.
Appointment of substituted surveyor
338
(1)
The minister may, after a special survey has been ordered, appoint
another surveyor approved by the Surveyor General in the place of the
surveyor directed to make the survey, and may, by the order appointing
the substituted surveyor, direct that as much of the special survey as
had been made by the surveyor first appointed must be adopted and made
use of by the substituted surveyor, and may then, or after the
completion of the special survey, determine how and by whom the work
of the surveyor first appointed is to be certified or otherwise
authenticated.
(2)
The special survey, although made by more than one surveyor, is, on
its final approval, as valid and binding for all purposes as if made
by the surveyor first appointed.
Report of surveyor
339
(1)
On completion of the survey, the surveyor must prepare and deposit
with the minister a plan in triplicate, together with 3 blue print
copies of it on blue print cloth, and a report in triplicate, which
must deal with the cost of the survey, the difficulties encountered,
the evidence concerning the re-establishment of original and lost
monuments, the system of survey employed, the degree of accuracy
obtained and the nature of all monuments erected, and must provide
other information bearing on the survey as may be of service in the
consideration of the report and plan.
(2)
The surveyor must include in the report in concise and tabulated form
(a)
a list of all parcels comprised within the limits of the survey, with
the names of the respective registered owners,
(b)
a list of all parcels the boundaries of which appear as altered by the
plan, with a statement showing how they are altered,
(c)
a statement of the costs and expenses of the survey, showing the
respective areas of parcels consisting of highways or Crown land, and
of land of private owners, and an apportionment of the costs and
expenses in accordance with sections 324, 325 and 326, and
(d)
a statement containing an estimate of the damage or increased value of
each parcel occasioned by the alterations affected by the plan, and
showing in detail a just and equitable apportionment among the
registered owners of the parcels affected, and the method adopted as
the basis of the apportionment in each case.
Notice to registrar
340
On receipt of the surveyor's report, the minister must transmit one of
the blue print copies of the plan and a copy of the report to the
registrar, together with a notice stating that the special survey has
been completed and the plan deposited by the surveyor under this Part.
Notice to corporate officer
341
The minister must also transmit to the corporate officer of the
municipality or regional district in which the land affected is
located one of the blue print copies of the plan and a copy of the
report, together with a notice stating that the special survey has

Notice of completion of survey
342
(1)
On receipt of the notice from the minister, the proper officer must
give to the same persons to whom notice is required to be given under
section 329, and in the same manner as provided for the giving of

section 344, and stating that the special survey has been
completed and that copies of the plan and the surveyor's report may be
inspected in the officer's office and in the land title office and
that the interests of the persons to whom the notice is directed may
be affected by the survey, and that a time and place will be set by
the minister for hearing complaints and claims for compensation, and
that notice of the time and place will appear in the Gazette and in a
newspaper circulating in the area in which the land affected by the
special survey is located.
(2)
The proper officer must keep a record of all notices given by the

issue out of the Supreme Court a subpoena commanding the attendance
for examination of a witness and the production by that witness of any
document or plan at the time and place mentioned in the subpoena.
(2)
Disobedience of a subpoena issued under subsection (1) is deemed to be
a contempt of court, and is punishable in the same manner and to the
same extent as in the case of subpoenas issued out of the Supreme
Court in civil causes.
(3)
The same fees are payable for subpoenas issued under this Part as in
the case of subpoenas issued out of the Supreme Court in civil causes,

together with the evidence and exhibits.
Power of minister to decide complaints and claims and make order
348
If no complaint or claim for compensation in writing has been
delivered to the minister within the time allowed for the delivery of
complaints and claims, then at any time after that, or if any
complaint or claim has been delivered, then on or after the hearing of

(i)
determine or direct any other matter necessary in connection with the

or the parcel disposed of, and also the manner and the time within
which fences, buildings and other structures may be torn down, removed
or dealt with.
Principles for determining compensation
349
In determining all questions relating to compensation, the minister
must be guided by the principle that as the survey was undertaken for
the benefit of all registered owners within the special survey area,
such registered owners should in proportion to the area of their
respective parcels share any loss and any advantage occasioned by and
accruing from the special survey, and that if for the general benefit
or for the preservation of individual improvements the surveyor has
reduced the area of any parcel, the registered owner should receive
compensation from the registered owner benefited or from a general
fund formed by payments from the registered owners benefited, as the
case may be, and that any registered owner who has been benefited
should contribute an adequate amount to the general fund or pay it to
the registered owner who has suffered loss, as the case may be.
Approval of survey and plan by Lieutenant Governor in Council
350
At any time after the minister has disposed of the complaints against
the special survey and claims, if any, and without further notice to
the parties interested, the Lieutenant Governor in Council may by
order in council, embodying in it the order made by the minister under
section 348,
(a)
confirm the order and findings of the minister made under
section 348,
(b)
approve of the special survey and plan or any part of it,
(c)
declare the special survey and plan, or such portion of it as the
Lieutenant Governor in Council may approve of, to be the true and
correct survey and plan of the land affected,
(d)
declare that all boundaries and lines fixed by the special survey and
plan are the true boundaries and lines, whether of highways, rivers or
creeks, when the rivers or creeks are defined on the plan by
measurements or lines in a manner as to be capable of absolute
location on the ground, or as between adjoining owners or between
adjoining parcels, and whether or not the boundaries and lines were
before that the true boundaries and lines, and
(e)
declare, with reservations as are expedient, that the plan approved
must be substituted for all former plans or surveys of the land
affected which have before that been registered, or for the
corresponding portions of those former plans or surveys.
Power to vest land
351
(1)
The Lieutenant Governor in Council may by the same or by a subsequent
order vest in the Crown or the municipality, as the case may be, land
which is by the special survey added to any previously existing
highway, and may in the same manner vest in the registered owner of
any previously existing parcel any land which is by the special survey
added to that parcel, or if the Crown is the owner of the parcel may
vest in the Crown the land added, or in the same manner may make any
further vesting or other order necessary to carry out the order of the
minister.
(2)
An order vesting land under this section is not an expropriation under
the
Expropriation Act
.
Notice of order in council approving of survey
352
(1)
A notice of the order in council approving of the special survey and
plan must be published in the Gazette, and when published is
conclusive evidence of the order in council and of the approval of the
survey and plan, and of the regularity of all proceedings leading up
to the making of the order in council.
(2)
Except insofar as it may be set aside or varied on appeal under this
Part, the order in council must not be set aside on any ground.
(3)

this Part and embodied in the order in council approving the special
survey and plan is subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
(2)
The Court of Appeal must decide the matter brought before it on appeal
as it considers just and equitable, and the decision of the Court of
Appeal is subject to appeal in the same manner as decisions of that
court on appeal from a final judgment in civil causes.
(3)
On every appeal the court appealed to may award compensation to any
party to the appeal as the court thinks proper, and may direct by whom
it must be paid, and may vary or amend the decision, order or
direction appealed from, and may direct the special survey and plan to
be amended by the minister in accordance with the decision on appeal,
and may, if it thinks necessary, refer the whole matter back to the
minister in order that the judgment of the court may be embodied in a
new report and submitted to the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and
may award costs and direct that they must be paid by a party to the
appeal, or that they must form part of the costs of the survey.
(4)
Evidence must not be given or heard on an appeal under this section
other than that given or heard before the minister at the time the
decision, order or direction appealed from was given or made.
Entry of appeal
354
(1)
The appeal must be entered for hearing in the court, and notice of the
appeal delivered at the office of the minister and to the registrar,
and served on all persons whose interests are directly affected,
within 20 days from the date of publication in the Gazette of the
notice of the order in council as provided in this Part.
(2)
An appeal of which notice has been served on the minister and
registrar does not abate because of it not having been served on other
persons directly affected, but the court may, on terms it thinks just,
allow an adjournment and direct any person affected to be served, and
may specify the method of service.
Registration
355
(1)
A certified copy of the order in council, together with the plan of
special survey, must be at once transmitted by the clerk of the
Executive Council to the registrar, and on the expiration of
20 days from the date of publication in the Gazette of the notice
of the order in council as provided in this Part without any appeal
being taken, the registrar must register it in the manner provided in
this Part.
(2)
If an appeal is taken, the minister must, on the giving of final
judgment in the appeal, transmit a certified copy of the judgment to
the registrar, and if the judgment refers the matter back to the
minister and a further order in council is passed, the clerk of the
Executive Council must transmit a certified copy of the order to the
registrar.
(3)
The registrar, on receipt of the final judgment or the order in
council, as the case may be, must, subject to any further appeal,
register it, together with the plan, in the manner provided.
Method of registration
356
(1)
Registration is effected by endorsing on the order in council and on
the judgment, if any, the following memorandum signed by the registrar
and impressed with the official seal of the land title office, and the
memorandum is conclusive evidence of the registration of the
instruments and of the time of registration:
The within document, together with the plan of the special survey
referred to, was registered ..................
[month, day, year]
. Filed as No. ...................., documents filed, and plan
deposited as No. .................... , plans deposited.
..................................................
Registrar
(2)
An endorsement of the registration of the order in council and special
survey plan and judgment, if any, must be made against the
indefeasible title of every parcel of land affected by the special
survey by noting the following information:
Special Survey Plan No. ............................ and order in
council approving same (and judgment) filed as No.
......................., and registered .......................
[month, day, year].
(3)
The registrar must, when necessary, correct indefeasible titles in
accordance with the order in council and special survey plan, and
duplicate indefeasible titles must, on request, be delivered to the
registrar for similar correction.
Effect of registration
357
(1)
On registration of the order in council and plan, the plan of special
survey becomes the official plan of the land comprised within the
limits of the plan or part of it approved, and is binding on all
persons, and all amounts of compensation, costs and expenses which by
the terms of the order are charged against the registered owner of any
parcel shown on the plan become a lien on that parcel respectively in
favour of the government or the municipality, or the person entitled
to receive it, as the case may be, and are assessable and collectable
in the manner provided.
(2)
If the plan shows an increase in the area of a parcel, as compared
with the original or previously existing survey or plan covering that
parcel, the plan as registered operates as a conveyance to the
registered owner of that parcel of the area added to that parcel by
