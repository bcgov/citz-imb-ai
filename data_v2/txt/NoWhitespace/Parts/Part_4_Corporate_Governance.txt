Cumulative voting for directors
98.1
(1)
The articles of a trust company or an insurance company may provide
for cumulative voting by members in the election of directors and, in
that event, the articles must include provisions to the following
effect:
(a)
that the trust company or insurance company have a specific number of
directors, with no allowance for minimum and maximum numbers of
directors;
(b)
that each member entitled to vote at an election of directors has the
right to cast a number of votes equal to the number of votes attached
to the shares held by the member multiplied by the number of directors
to be elected, and that each member may cast all the votes in favour
of one candidate or distribute the votes among the candidates in any
manner;
(c)
that a separate vote of members must be taken with respect to each
candidate nominated for director unless a resolution is passed
unanimously permitting 2 or more persons to be elected by a single
resolution;
(d)
that, if a member has voted for more than one candidate without
specifying the distribution of votes among the candidates, the votes
must be distributed equally among the candidates;
(e)

number of positions to be filled, the candidates who receive the least
number of votes must be eliminated until the number of candidates
remaining equals the number of positions to be filled;
(f)
that a director may not be removed from office if the votes cast
against removal would be sufficient to elect a director if they were
voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of
votes were cast and the number of directors required by the articles
were being elected;
(g)
that the number of directors required by the articles may not be
decreased if the votes cast against the motion to decrease would be
sufficient to elect a director if they were voted cumulatively at an
election at which the same total number of votes were cast and the
number of directors required by the articles were being elected.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), a provision in the articles of a trust company
or an insurance company that authorizes cumulative voting by members
in the election of directors does not apply when any one member of the
company beneficially owns or controls, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued voting shares in the company.
(3)
If the articles of a trust company or an insurance company provide for
cumulative voting, no holders of any class of shares of the trust

more directors.

cumulative voting, the members of the trust company or insurance
company must,

in the articles, and

at each succeeding annual meeting,
elect directors to hold office until the close of the next annual
meeting of members following the directors' election.
