If a fraternal society transacts endowment or expectancy insurance and
has an endowment fund separate and distinct from its life insurance
fund, the society, by resolution passed at a general meeting after at
least one month's notice of the intended resolution, may determine
that the endowment or expectancy be discontinued, with the endowment
or expectancy fund, as the case may be, to be distributed
proportionately among the society's members then in good standing who
are contributing to the fund, to each member according to the member's
total contribution.
(2)
Subject to first receiving the written approval of the superintendent,
the fraternal society may proceed to ascertain the persons entitled to
rank on distribution of the fund and may distribute the fund among
those entitled, and the distribution discharges the society from all
liability in respect of the fund, and of the endowment or expectancy
contracts undertaken by the society.
(3)
If all the members interested in the endowment or expectancy fund are
also interested as holders of life insurance contracts, members at the
general meeting, instead of determining that the endowment or
expectancy fund be distributed, by resolution passed at the meeting,
may determine that the fund be converted into or merged in a life
insurance fund, and then, subject to the superintendent first
approving the resolution, the endowment or expectancy fund becomes a
life insurance fund.

Determination of base level ownership percentage
49
(1)
If, on September 15, 1990, a person and connected parties had a
substantial interest in a trust company, insurance company or holding
company, then on that date the person and connected parties were by
this subsection assigned a base level ownership percentage that was
the same as that substantial interest.
(2)
If, at the end of the consent expiry day specified in a consent under
section 50 (4), the person and connected parties to which the consent
applies have a substantial interest in the company named in the
consent, then the person and connected parties are by this subsection,
as of the end of that day, assigned a base level ownership percentage
that is the same as
(a)
the substantial interest of the person and connected parties at the
end of that day, if that substantial interest is less than the
proposed base level ownership percentage specified in the expired
consent, or

the proposed base level ownership percentage specified in the expired
consent, if the substantial interest of the person and connected
parties at the end of that day is the same as or greater than the

(3)
If the substantial interest of a person and connected parties in a
trust company, insurance company or holding company is decreased to a
level constituting a substantial interest that is more than 5%
lower than the base level ownership percentage applicable to the

replaced under paragraph (a), or
(ii)
made inapplicable by subsection (5).
(5)
If the substantial interest of a person and connected parties in a
trust company, insurance company or holding company is decreased to a
level that is not a substantial interest in the company then as of the
time of the decrease to that level any base level ownership percentage
previously assigned by this section to that person and connected
parties ceases to be assigned to them and is on and after that time
inapplicable to them.

Shares acquired in contravention of section 50 not registrable
53
The directors of a trust company, insurance company or holding company
must not allow a transfer of voting shares in the company to be

If dividends are paid by a trust company, insurance company or holding

a cause of action for the recovery of the amount of the dividends paid
against the members to whom they were paid whether or not the company
had knowledge of the contravention.
(3)
Despite subsection (1), the directors may authorize the payment of a
dividend in respect of any voting shares to a person who would

Validity of transfer of voting shares
56
The validity of a transfer of voting shares in a trust company,
insurance company or holding company that has been entered in its
