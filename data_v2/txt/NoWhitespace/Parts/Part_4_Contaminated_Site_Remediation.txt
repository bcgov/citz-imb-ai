General principles of liability for remediation
47
(1)
A person who is responsible for remediation of a contaminated site is
absolutely, retroactively and jointly and separately liable to any
person or government body for reasonably incurred costs of remediation
of the contaminated site, whether incurred on or off the contaminated
site.
(2)
Subsection (1) must not be construed as prohibiting the apportionment
of a share of liability to one or more responsible persons by the
court in an action or proceeding under subsection (5) or by a director
in an order under section 48
[remediation orders]
.
(3)
For the purpose of this section,
"costs of remediation"
means all costs of remediation and includes, without limitation,
(a)
costs of preparing a site disclosure statement,
(b)
costs of carrying out a site investigation and preparing a report,
whether or not there has been a determination under section 44
[determination of contaminated sites]
as to whether or not the site is a contaminated site,
(c)
legal and consultant costs associated with seeking contributions from
other responsible persons, and
(d)
fees imposed by a director, a municipality, an approving officer or
the regulator under this Part.
(4)
Liability under this Part applies
(a)
even though the introduction of a substance into the environment is or
was not prohibited by any legislation if the introduction contributed
in whole or in part to the site becoming a contaminated site, and
(b)
despite the terms of any cancelled, expired, abandoned or current
permit or approval or waste management plan and its associated
operational certificate that authorizes the discharge of waste into
the environment.
(5)
Subject to section 50 (3)
[minor contributors]
, any person, including, but not limited to, a responsible person and
a director, who incurs costs in carrying out remediation of a

the reasonably incurred costs of remediation from one or more
responsible persons in accordance with the principles of liability set
out in this Part.
(6)
Subject to subsections (7) and (8), a person is not required to
obtain, as a condition of an action or proceeding under subsection (5)
being heard by a court,
(a)
a decision, determination, opinion or apportionment of liability for
remediation from a director, or
(b)
an opinion respecting liability from an allocation panel.
(7)
In all cases, the site that is the subject of an action or proceeding
must be determined or considered under section 44
[determination of contaminated sites]
to be or to have been a contaminated site before the court can hear
the matter.
(8)
Despite subsection (7), if independent remediation has been carried
out at a site and the site has not been determined or considered under
section 44
[determination of contaminated sites]
to be or to have been a contaminated site, the court must determine
whether the site is or was a contaminated site.

whether the site is a contaminated site, as soon as reasonably
possible after the issuance of the order, the director must determine
(a)
whether the site is a contaminated site, in accordance with section 44
[determination of contaminated sites]
, and
(b)
whether the person named in the order is a responsible person under
section 45
[persons responsible for remediation of contaminated sites]
.

notice of a remediation order under subsection (13) must not, without
the consent of the director, knowingly do anything that diminishes or
reduces assets that could be used to satisfy the terms and conditions
of the remediation order, and if the person does so, the director
despite any other remedy sought, may commence an action against the
person to recover the amount of the diminishment or reduction.
(9)
The director may provide in a remediation order that a responsible
person is not required to begin remediation of a contaminated site for
a specified period of time if the contaminated site does not present
an imminent and significant threat or risk to

A director, on request by any person, may appoint an allocation panel
consisting of 3 allocation advisors to provide an opinion as to any or
all of the following:
(a)
whether the person is a responsible person;
(b)
whether a responsible person is a minor contributor;
(c)
the responsible person's contribution to the contamination and, if the
costs of remediation are known or reasonably ascertainable, the share
of those costs attributable to that contamination.
(3)
For the purpose of providing an opinion under subsection (2) (b) and
(c), the allocation panel must, to the extent of available
information, consider the following:
(a)
the information available to identify a person's relative contribution
to the contamination;
(b)
the nature and quantity of substances causing the contamination;
(c)
the degree of toxicity of the substances causing the contamination;
(d)
the degree of involvement by the responsible person, compared with one

person, at the responsible person's own expense, seek and provide to
the director the opinion of an allocation panel under subsection (2).
(5)
If a director appoints an allocation panel with respect to a site, the
site is considered to be a contaminated site at the time the
allocation panel is appointed, despite the absence of a determination
under section 44 (1)

A director may determine that a responsible person is a minor
contributor if the person demonstrates that
(a)
only a minor portion of the contamination present at the site can be
attributed to the person,
(b)
either
(i)
no remediation would be required solely as a result of the
contribution of the person to the contamination at the site, or
(ii)
the cost of remediation attributable to the person would be only a
minor portion of the total cost of the remediation required at the
site, and
(c)
in all circumstances the application of joint and separate liability
to the person would be unduly harsh.
(2)
If a director makes a determination under subsection (1) that a
responsible person is a minor contributor, the director must determine
the amount or portion of remediation costs attributable to the
responsible person.
(3)
A responsible person determined to be a minor contributor under
subsection (1) is liable for remediation costs in an action or
proceeding brought by another person or the government under section
47
[general principles of liability for remediation]
only up to the amount or portion specified by the director in the
determination under subsection (2).
(4)
