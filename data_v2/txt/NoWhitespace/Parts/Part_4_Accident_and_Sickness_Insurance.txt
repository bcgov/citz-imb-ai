contract and no agent has authority to change the contract or
waive any of its provisions.
Material facts

furnished as evidence of insurability.
Changes in occupation
3.
(1)
If after this policy is issued the person insured engages for
compensation in an occupation that is classified by the insurer
as more hazardous than that stated in the contract, the
liability under the contract is limited to the amount that the
premium paid would have purchased for the more hazardous
occupation according to the limits, classification of risks, and
premium rates in use by the insurer at the time the person
insured engaged in the more hazardous occupation.
(2)
If the person insured changes occupation from that stated in the
contract to an occupation classified by the insurer as less
hazardous and the insurer is so advised in writing, the insurer
must either
(a)
reduce the premium rate, or
(b)
issue a policy for the unexpired term of the contract at the
lower rate of premium applicable to the less hazardous
occupation,
according to the limits, classification of risks, and premium
rates used by the insurer at the date of receipt of advice of

amount by which the unearned premium on the contract exceeds the
premium at the lower rate for the unexpired term.

contract, and
(b)
the refund must accompany the notice.
(3)
If the contract is terminated by the insured, the insurer must
refund as soon as practicable the excess of premium actually
paid by the insured over the short rate premium calculated to
the date of receipt of the notice according to the table in use
by the insurer at the time of termination.

the case of sickness or disability, its duration.
Failure to give notice or proof
(2)
Failure to give notice of claim or furnish proof of claim within
the time required by this condition does not invalidate the
claim if
(a)
the notice or proof is given or furnished as soon as reasonably
possible, and in no event later than one year after the date of
the accident or the date a claim arises under the contract on
account of sickness or disability, and it is shown that it was
not reasonably possible to give the notice or furnish the proof
in the time required by this condition, or
(b)
in the case of the death of the person insured, if a declaration
of presumption of death is necessary, the notice or proof is
given or furnished no later than one year after the date a court
makes the declaration.
Insurer to furnish forms for proof of claim

loss.

insurer within 30 days after it has received proof of claim, and
payment must be made after that date in accordance with the

(4)
Statutory Conditions 3, 4 and 7, and, subject to the restriction in
subsection (5), Statutory Condition 5 may be varied; but if by
reason of the variation the contract is less favourable to the
insured, a person insured, or a beneficiary than it would be if the
condition had not been varied, the condition is deemed to be included
in the policy in the form in which it appears in section 101.
(5)
Statutory Condition 5 (1) (a) and (b) may not be varied in policies

premium due under the contract or renewal has not been fully paid,

Despite subsection (3), if the court considers it just to do so, the
court may dispense with the notice in the case of a person other than
(a)
the insurer, or
(b)
if the contract is a contract of group insurance or creditor's group
insurance, the insured.
(5)
An order made under subsection (1) binds any person having an interest
in the contract.
Capacity of minors
110
Except in respect of the minor's rights as a beneficiary, a minor who
has reached the age of 16 years has the capacity of a person of the
age of 19 years
(a)
to make an enforceable contract, and
(b)
in respect of a contract.
Duty to disclose
111
(1)
An applicant for insurance and a person to be insured must each
disclose to the insurer in the application, on a medical examination,
if any, and in any written statements or answers furnished as evidence
of insurability, every fact within the applicant's or person's
knowledge that is material to the insurance and is not so disclosed by
the other.
(2)
Subject to sections 112 and 115 and subsection (3) of this section, a
failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact referred to in
subsection (1) renders the contract voidable by the insurer.
(3)
A failure to disclose or misrepresentation referred to in subsection
(1) relating to evidence of insurability with respect to an
application for
(a)
additional coverage under a contract,
(b)
an increase in insurance under a contract, or
(c)
any other change to insurance after the policy is issued
renders the contract voidable by the insurer but only in relation to
the addition, increase or change.
Failure to disclose
112
(1)
Subject to section 115 and subsections (2) to (4) of this section, if
a contract, including renewals of it, or an addition, increase or
change referred to in section 111 (3), has been in effect for 2 years
with respect to a person insured, a failure to disclose, or a
misrepresentation of, a fact required by section 111 to be disclosed
in respect of that person insured does not, in the absence of fraud,
render the contract voidable.
(2)
In the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group
insurance, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact
required by section 111 to be disclosed in respect of a group person
insured, a person insured or a debtor insured does not render the
contract voidable, but
(a)
if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of
insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of
application for the insurance in respect of the person, the insurance
in respect of that person is voidable by the insurer, and
(b)
if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of
insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of
application for an addition, increase or change referred to in section
111 (3) in respect of the person, the addition, increase or change in
respect of that person is voidable by the insurer,
unless the insurance, addition, increase or change has been in effect
for 2 years during the lifetime of that person, in which case the
insurance, addition, increase or change is not, in the absence of
fraud, voidable.
(3)
If a claim arises from a loss incurred or a disability beginning
before a contract, including renewals of it, has been in effect for 2
years with respect to the person in respect of whom the claim is made,
subsection (1) does not apply to that claim.
(4)
If a claim arises from a loss incurred or a disability beginning
before the addition, increase or change has been in effect for 2 years
with respect to the person in respect of whom the claim is made,
subsection (1) does not apply to that claim.
Failure to disclose on reinstatement
113
Sections 111 and 112 apply, as far as applicable and with the
necessary changes, to a failure at the time of reinstatement of a
contract to disclose or a misrepresentation at that time, and the
period of 2 years to which reference is made in section 112
begins to run in respect of a reinstatement from the date of
reinstatement.
Pre-existing conditions
114
If a contract contains a general exception or reduction with respect
to pre-existing disease or physical conditions and the person insured,
group person insured or debtor insured suffers or has suffered from a
disease or physical condition that existed before the date the
contract came into force with respect to that person and the disease
or physical condition is not by name or specific description excluded
from the insurance respecting that person,
(a)
the prior existence of the disease or physical condition is not,
except in the case of fraud, available as a defence against liability
in whole or in part for a loss incurred or a disability beginning
after the contract, including renewals of it, has been in effect
continuously for 2 years immediately before the date of loss incurred
or commencement of disability with respect to that person, and
(b)
the prior existence of the disease or physical condition is not,
except in the case of fraud, available as a defence against liability
in whole or in part if the disease or physical condition was disclosed
in the application for the contract.
Misstatement of age
115
(1)
Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if the age of the person insured
has been misstated to the insurer, then, at the option of the insurer,
either
(a)
the benefits payable under the contract may be increased or decreased
to the amount that would have been provided for the same premium at
the correct age, or
(b)
the premium may be adjusted in accordance with the correct age as of
the date the person insured became insured.
(2)
In the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group
insurance, if there is a misstatement to the insurer of the age of a
group person insured, person insured or debtor insured, the
provisions, if any, of the contract with respect to age or
misstatement of age apply.
(3)
If the age of a person affects the commencement or termination of the
insurance, the correct age governs.
Termination and replacement of group policies
116
(1)
If a contract of group insurance or a benefit provision in a contract
of group insurance is terminated, the insurer continues, as though the
contract or benefit provision had remained in full force and effect,
to be liable to pay to or in respect of a group person insured under
the contract benefits relating to
(a)
loss of income because of disability,
(b)
death,
(c)
dismemberment, or
(d)
accidental damage to natural teeth,
arising from an accident or sickness that occurred before the
termination of the contract or benefit provision, if the disability,
death, dismemberment or accidental damage to natural teeth is reported
to the insurer within the 6 month period following the termination or
a longer continuous period specified in the contract.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), an insurer does not remain liable under a
contract or benefit provision described in that subsection to pay a
benefit for loss of income for the recurrence of a disability after
both of the following occur:
(a)
the termination of the contract or benefit provision;
(b)
a continuous period of 6 months, or any longer period provided in the
contract, during which the group person insured was not disabled.
(3)
An insurer that is liable under subsection (1) to pay a benefit for
loss of income as a result of the disability of a group person insured
is not liable to pay the benefit for any period longer than the
portion remaining, at the date the disability began, of the maximum
period provided under the contract for the payment of a benefit for
loss of income in respect of a disability of the group person insured.
(4)
If a contract of group insurance, in this subsection called the
"replacement contract", is entered into within 31 days after the
termination of another contract of group insurance, in this subsection
called the "other contract", and that replacement contract insures
some or all of the same group person insureds as the other contract,
(a)
the replacement contract is deemed to provide that any person who was
insured under the other contract at the time of its termination is
insured under the replacement contract from and after the termination
of the other contract if
(i)
the insurance on that person under the other contract terminated by
reason only of the termination of the other contract, and
(ii)
the person is a member of a class eligible for insurance under the
replacement contract,
(b)
every person who was insured under the other contract and who is
insured under the replacement contract is entitled to receive credit
for any deductible earned before the effective date of the replacement
contract, and
(c)
no person who was insured under the other contract at the time of its
termination may be excluded from eligibility under the replacement
contract by reason only of not being actively at work on the effective
date of the replacement contract,
and, despite subsection (1), if the replacement contract provides that
all benefits required to be paid under subsection (1) by the insurer
of the other contract are to be paid instead under the replacement
contract, the insurer of the other contract is not liable to pay those
benefits.
Designation of beneficiary
117
(1)
Subject to subsection (4), an insured may in a contract or by a
declaration designate the insured, the insured's personal
representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for whose
benefit insurance money is to be payable.
(2)
Subject to section 118, an insured may by declaration alter or revoke
a designation referred to in subsection (1).
(3)
A designation in favour of the "heirs", "next of kin" or "estate" of
an insured, or the use of words having a similar meaning in a
designation, is deemed to be a designation of the personal
representative of the insured.
(4)
Subject to the regulations, an insurer may restrict or exclude in a
contract the right of an insured to designate persons to whom or for
whose benefit insurance money is to be payable.
(5)
A contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group
insurance on some or all of the group person insureds under the
replaced contract may provide that a designation applicable to the
replaced contract of a group person insured, a group person insured's
personal representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for
whose benefit insurance money is to be payable is deemed to apply to
the replacing contract.
(6)
If a contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group
insurance provides that a designation referred to in subsection (5) is
deemed to apply to the replacing contract,
(a)
each certificate in respect of the replacing contract must indicate
that the designation under the replaced contract has been carried
forward and that the group person insured should review the existing
designation to ensure it reflects the group person insured's current
intentions, and
(b)
as between the insurer under the replacing contract and a claimant
under that contract, that insurer is liable to the claimant for any
errors or omissions by the previous insurer in respect of the
recording of the designation carried forward under the replacing
contract.
(7)
If a beneficiary becomes entitled to insurance money and all or part
of the insurance money remains with the insurer under a settlement
option provided for in the contract or permitted by the insurer, that
portion of the insurance money remaining with the insurer is deemed to
be insurance money held under a contract of life insurance on the life
of the beneficiary, and, subject to the provisions of the settlement
option, the beneficiary has the same rights and interests with respect
to the insurance money that an insured has under a contract of life
insurance.
Irrevocable designation of beneficiary
118
(1)
An insured may in a contract or by a declaration, other than a
declaration that is part of a will, filed with the insurer at its head
or principal office in Canada during the lifetime of the person whose
life or well being or both are insured, designate a beneficiary
irrevocably, and in that event the insured, while the beneficiary is
living, may not alter or revoke the designation without the consent of
the beneficiary, and the insurance money is not subject to the control
of the insured or the claims of the insured's creditors and does not
form part of the insured's estate.
(2)
If an insured purports to designate a beneficiary irrevocably in a
will, or in a declaration that is not filed with the insurer, the
designation has the same effect as if the insured had not purported to
make it irrevocable.
Designation in will
119
(1)
A designation in an instrument purporting to be a will is not
ineffective by reason only of the fact that the instrument is invalid
as a will or the designation is invalid as a bequest under the will.
(2)
Despite the
Wills, Estates and Succession Act
, a designation in a will is of no effect against a designation made
later than the making of the will.
(3)
If a designation is contained in a will and subsequently the will is
revoked by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.
(4)
If a designation is contained in an instrument that purports to be a
will and the instrument, if it were valid as a will, would be revoked
by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.
Trustee for beneficiary
120
(1)
An insured may in a contract or by a declaration appoint a trustee for
a beneficiary, and may alter or revoke the appointment by a
declaration.
(2)
A payment made by an insurer to the trustee for a beneficiary
discharges the insurer to the extent of the amount of the payment.
Predeceased or disclaiming beneficiary
121
(1)
If a beneficiary predeceases the person insured or group person
insured, as the case may be, and no disposition of the share of the
deceased beneficiary in the insurance money is provided for in the
contract or by declaration, the share is payable
(a)
to the surviving beneficiary,
(b)
if there is more than one surviving beneficiary, to the surviving
beneficiaries in equal shares, or
(c)
if there is no surviving beneficiary, to the insured or group person
insured, as the case may be, or the insured's or the group person
insured's personal representative.
(2)
If 2 or more beneficiaries are designated otherwise than
alternatively, but no division of the insurance money is made, the
insurance money is payable to them in equal shares.
(3)
A beneficiary may disclaim the beneficiary's right to insurance money
by filing notice in writing with the insurer at its head or principal
office in Canada.
(4)
A notice of disclaimer filed under subsection (3) is irrevocable.
(5)
Subsection (1) applies in the case of a disclaiming beneficiary, or in
the case of a beneficiary determined by a court to be disentitled to
insurance money, as if the disclaiming or disentitled beneficiary
predeceased the person whose life or well being or both are insured.
Enforcement of payment by beneficiary or trustee
122
A beneficiary may enforce in the beneficiary's own name and for the
beneficiary's own benefit, and a trustee appointed under section 120
may enforce as trustee, the payment of insurance money made payable to
the beneficiary or trustee in the contract or by a declaration and in
accordance with the provisions of it, but the insurer may set up any
defence that it could have set up against the insured or the insured's
personal representative.
Documents affecting right to insurance money
and effect of assignment
123
(1)
Until an insurer receives at its head or principal office in Canada an
instrument or an order of a court affecting the right to receive
insurance money, or a notarial copy or a copy verified by statutory
declaration of any such instrument or order, it may make payment of
the insurance money and is as fully discharged to the extent of the
amount paid as if there were no such instrument or order.
(2)
Subsection (1) does not affect the rights or interests of any person
other than the insurer.
(3)
If an assignee of a contract gives notice in writing of the assignment
to the insurer at its head or principal office in Canada, the assignee
has priority of interest as against
(a)
any assignee other than one who gave notice earlier in like manner,
and
(b)
a beneficiary, other than one designated irrevocably as provided for
in section 118 before the assignee gave notice to the insurer of the
assignment in the manner provided for in this subsection.
(4)
If a contract is assigned as security, the rights of a beneficiary
under the contract are affected only to the extent necessary to give
effect to the rights and interests of the assignee.
(5)
If a contract is assigned unconditionally and otherwise than as
security, the assignee has all the rights and interests given by the
contract and by this Part to the insured, and is deemed to be the
insured.
(6)
Unless the document by which a contract is assigned specifies
otherwise, an assignment described in subsection (5) made on or after
the date this section comes into force revokes
(a)
a designation of a beneficiary made before or after that date and not
made irrevocably, and
(b)
a nomination referred to in section 127 made before or after that
date.
(7)
A contract may provide that the rights or interests of the insured or,
in the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group
insurance, of the group person insured or debtor insured, as
applicable, are not assignable.
Insurance money exempt from seizure
124
(1)
If a beneficiary is designated, any insurance money payable to the
beneficiary is not, from the time of the happening of the event on
which it becomes payable, part of the estate of the insured, and is
not subject to the claims of the creditors of the insured.
(2)
While there is in effect a designation in favour of any one or more of
a spouse, child, grandchild or parent of the person insured or group
person insured, the insurance money and the rights and interests of
the insured in the insurance money and in the contract so far as
either relate to accidental death benefits are exempt from execution
or seizure.
Assignment of insurance
125
(1)
If a beneficiary
(a)
is not designated irrevocably, or
(b)
is designated irrevocably but has attained the age of 19 years and
consents,
the insured may assign, exercise rights under or in respect of,
surrender or otherwise deal with the contract as provided in the
contract or in this Part or as may be agreed on with the insurer.
(2)
Despite section 118 (1), if a beneficiary is designated irrevocably
and has not consented as described in subsection (l) (b) of this
section, the insured may exercise any rights in respect of the
contract that are prescribed by regulation.
(3)
Subject to the terms of a consent under subsection (l) (b) or a court
order under subsection (4), if there is an irrevocable designation of
a beneficiary under a contract, a person acquiring an interest in the
contract takes that interest subject to the rights of that
beneficiary.
(4)
When a beneficiary who is designated irrevocably is unable to provide
consent under subsection (1) (b) because of legal incapacity, an
insured may apply to the court for an order permitting the insured to
deal with the contract without that consent.
(5)
The court may grant an order under subsection (4) on any notice and
terms it considers just.
Entitlement to dividends
126
(1)
Despite the irrevocable designation of a beneficiary, the insured is
entitled before the insured's death to the dividends or bonuses
declared on a contract, unless the contract provides otherwise.
(2)
Unless the insured directs otherwise, the insurer may apply the
dividends or bonuses declared on the contract for the purpose of
keeping the contract in force.
Transfer of insured's rights
127
(1)
Despite the
Wills, Estates and Succession Act
, if, in a contract or declaration, it is provided that a person named
in the contract or declaration has, on the death of the insured, the
rights and interests of the insured in the contract,
(a)
the rights and interests of the insured in the contract do not, on the
death of the insured, form part of the insured's estate, and
(b)
on the death of the insured, the person named in the contract or
declaration has the rights and interests given to the insured by the
contract and by this Part and is deemed to be the insured.
(2)
If the contract or declaration provides that 2 or more persons named
in the contract or in the declaration, on the death of the insured,
have successively on the death of each of them the rights and
interests of the insured in the contract, this section applies
successively, so far as applicable and with the necessary changes, to
each of those persons and their rights and interests in the contract.
(3)
Despite a nomination made under this section, the insured may, before
the insured's death,
(a)
assign, exercise rights under or in respect of, surrender or otherwise
deal with the contract as if the nomination had not been made, and
(b)
subject to the terms of the contract, alter or revoke the nomination
by declaration.
Group person insured may enforce rights
128
A group person insured may, in the group person insured's own name,
enforce a right given by a contract to the group person insured, or to
a person insured under the contract as a person dependent on or
related to the group person insured, subject to any defence available
to the insurer against the group person insured, such person insured
or the insured.
Debtor insured may enforce rights
129
(1)
A debtor insured, or a debtor who is jointly liable for the debt with
the debtor insured, may enforce
(a)
in the case of the debtor insured, in the debtor insured's own name,
or
(b)
in the case of the jointly liable debtor, in the jointly liable
debtor's own name,
the creditor's rights in respect of a claim arising in relation to the
debtor insured, subject to any defence available to the insurer
against the creditor or debtor insured.
(2)
Subject to subsection (3), if an insurer pays insurance money in
respect of a claim under subsection (1), the insurer must pay the
insurance money to the creditor.
(3)
If the debtor insured provides evidence satisfactory to the insurer
that the insurance money exceeds the debt then owing to the creditor,
the insurer may pay the excess directly to that debtor insured.
Simultaneous deaths
130
Unless a contract or a declaration otherwise provides, if a person
insured or group person insured and a beneficiary die at the same time
or in circumstances rendering it uncertain which of them survived the
other, the insurance money is payable as if the beneficiary had
predeceased the person insured or group person insured.
Payment into court
131
(1)
If an insurer admits liability for insurance money or any part of it
and it appears to the insurer that
(a)
there are adverse claimants,
(b)
there is no person capable of giving and authorized to give a valid
discharge who is willing to do so,
(c)
the insurance money has become unclaimed property under the
Unclaimed Property Act
,
(d)
there is no person entitled to the insurance money, or
(e)
the person to whom the insurance money is payable would be disentitled
on public policy or other grounds,
the insurer may, without notice to any person, apply to the court for
an order for payment of the money into court.
(2)
On application under this section, the court may, on notice, if any,
as it thinks necessary, make an order for payment of the insurance
money into court.
(3)
On payment into court of insurance money referred to in subsection (1)
(c), Part 3 of the
Unclaimed Property Act
ceases to apply to that money.
(4)
The court may fix without taxation the costs incurred for an
application or order made under this section, and may order the costs
to be paid out of the insurance money or by the insurer, or otherwise
as it deems just.
(5)
A payment made under an order under this section discharges the
insurer to the extent of the payment.
Payment of insurance money for minors
132
(1)
If an insurer admits liability for insurance money payable to a minor
or for insurance money payable to a trustee for a beneficiary who is a
minor, the insurer, within 60 days after the contract conditions
respecting payment are substantially fulfilled, or within a shorter
period required under the contract, must
(a)
in the case of money payable to a minor, other than a minor referred
to in paragraph (b), pay the money in trust for the minor
(i)
to a trustee for the minor appointed in relation to that money by the
insured or group person insured in a contract or by a declaration, or
(ii)
if no trustee is appointed for the minor in relation to that money, to
the Public Guardian and Trustee,
(b)
in the case of money payable to a minor referred to in subsection (4),
pay the money to the minor, and
(c)
in the case of money payable to a trustee for a beneficiary who is a
minor, pay the money to the trustee.
(2)
An insurer who makes a payment under subsection (1) (a) (i) or (c)
must, within 30 days after the date of payment, give written notice to
the Public Guardian and Trustee stating the name and address of the
minor, the name and address of the trustee and the amount of the
payment.
(3)
Payment of the insurance money referred to in subsection (1)
discharges the insurer if the payment is made in accordance with
subsection (1).
(4)
A beneficiary who has reached the age of 18 years has the capacity of
a person who has reached the age of 19 years for the purposes of
receiving insurance money payable to the minor and giving a discharge
for it.
Payment to representative of beneficiary
133
Despite section 132, if it appears to an insurer that a representative
of a beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise under a legal disability
may accept payments on behalf of the beneficiary under the law of the
jurisdiction in which the beneficiary resides, the insurer may make
payment to the representative, and the payment discharges the insurer
to the extent of the amount paid.
Payments not exceeding $10 000
134
Even though insurance money is payable to a person, the insurer may,
if the contract provides, but subject always to the rights of an
assignee, pay an amount not exceeding $10 000 to
(a)
a relative of a person insured or the group person insured, or
(b)
a person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled to the
insurance money by reason of having incurred expense for the
maintenance, medical attendance or burial of a person insured or the
group person insured, or to have a claim against the estate of a
person insured or the group person insured in relation to such an
expense,
and any payment discharges the insurer to the extent of the amount
paid.
Payment of insurance money
135
(1)
Subject to subsections (2), (4) and (5), insurance money is payable in
British Columbia.
(2)
In the case of a contract of group insurance, insurance money is
payable in the province or territory of Canada in which the group
person insured was resident at the time the person became insured.
(3)
Unless a contract otherwise provides, a reference to dollars means
Canadian dollars whether the contract by its terms provides for
payment in Canada or elsewhere.
(4)
If a person entitled to receive insurance money is not resident in
British Columbia, the insurer may pay the insurance money to that
person or to any other person who is entitled to receive it on the
person's behalf by the law of the jurisdiction in which the payee
resides, and the payment discharges the insurer to the extent of the
amount paid.
(5)
If insurance money is payable under a contract to a deceased person
who was not resident in British Columbia at the date of their death or
to that person's personal representative, the insurer may pay the
insurance money to the deceased person's personal representative as
appointed under the law of the jurisdiction in which the person was
resident at the date of their death, and the payment discharges the
insurer to the extent of the amount paid.
Action in British Columbia
136
Regardless of the place where a contract was made, a claimant who is a
resident of British Columbia may bring an action in British Columbia
if the insurer was authorized to transact insurance in British
Columbia at the time the contract was made or is so authorized at the
time the action is brought.
Insurer giving information
137
An insurer does not incur any liability for any default, error or
omission in giving or withholding information as to any notice or
instrument that it has received and that affects the insurance money.
Undue prominence
138
The insurer must not in the policy give undue prominence to any
provision or statutory condition as compared to other provisions or
statutory conditions, unless the effect of that provision or statutory
condition is to increase the premium or decrease the benefits
otherwise provided for in the policy.
Presumption against agency
139
An officer, agent or employee of an insurer, or a person soliciting
insurance whether or not an agent of the insurer, must not be
considered to be the agent of the insured, person insured, group
person insured or debtor insured, to that person's prejudice, in
respect of any question arising out of a contract.
