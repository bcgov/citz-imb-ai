caveat has been lodged.
Effect of caveat
288

register another instrument affecting the land described in the
caveat, unless the instrument is expressed to be subject to the claim
of the caveator, or
(b)
deposit a plan of subdivision or otherwise allow any change in
boundaries affecting the land described in the caveat, unless
consented to by the caveator.
(2)
An instrument expressed to be subject to the claim of the caveator may
be registered or deposited, unless the claim of the caveator, if
successful, would, in the opinion of the registrar, destroy the root
of title of the person against whose title the caveat has been lodged.
Proceedings for discharge of caveat
289
(1)
An owner or other person claiming an estate or interest in land or a
charge, in this Act referred to as the "caveatee", may, before the

caveator to attend before the court to show cause why the caveat
should not be discharged.

The court may,
(a)
on proof that the caveator has been served with the notice, and
(b)
on such evidence as the court may require,
make such order as the court may consider proper.

procedure must be as nearly as may be in conformity with the Supreme
Court Civil Rules.

Withdrawal of caveat
290
(1)
A caveator may, by notice in writing, which may be in the form
approved by the director, to the registrar, withdraw the caveat at any
time, but the withdrawal of the caveat does not prejudice the power of
the court to make an order as to payment by the caveator of the costs
of the caveatee incurred before the receipt by the caveatee of the
notice.
(2)
The notice may be signed by the caveator or the caveator's personal
representative, or, if the caveat was signed by a solicitor, by that
solicitor.
Further caveat lodged after caveat has lapsed, been withdrawn or
discharged
291
(1)
After a caveat has lapsed or has been withdrawn or discharged a
caveator must not, except as mentioned in this section, lodge another
caveat in respect of the same matter.
(2)
If a caveator has withdrawn the caveat, the registrar may, on terms
the registrar considers proper, allow one further caveat to be lodged
in respect of the same matter.
(3)
Nothing in this section affects the right of the registrar to lodge a
caveat under this Act.
Registration of withdrawal, lapse or discharge of caveat
292
On application to the registrar, together with such evidence as the
registrar may require, the registrar must make an endorsement in the
register of the withdrawal, lapse or discharge of a caveat.
Lapse of caveat
293
(1)
A caveat lodged under this Act lapses and ceases to affect the title
to land after the expiration of 2 months after the date it was
lodged with the registrar, unless within that period the caveator
commences an action to establish the caveator's title to the estate or
interest claimed and registers a certificate of pending litigation.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), if a caveatee, in accordance with the caveat
serves, at least 21 days before the expiry of the 2 months referred to
in subsection (1), a notice in the form approved by the director on
the caveator or the caveator's solicitor or agent filing the caveat,
as the case may be, to withdraw the caveat or take proceedings in
court to establish the claim made in the caveat, the caveat lapses and
ceases to affect the caveatee's title to the land after the expiration
of 21 days after the date of service, unless within the 21 day period
the caveator commences an action to establish the caveator's title to
the estate or interest claimed and registers a certificate of pending
litigation.
(3)
This section does not apply to a caveat lodged by the registrar.
Compensation if caveat lodged wrongfully
294
(1)
If a caveator wrongfully and without reasonable cause lodges or causes
to be lodged with the registrar a caveat, the caveator is liable to
pay to the person who sustains damage by it such compensation as the
Supreme Court considers just.
(2)
This section does not apply to a caveat lodged by the registrar.
