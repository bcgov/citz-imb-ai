Deposit of leasehold strata plan
201
The registrar must not accept for deposit a leasehold strata plan
unless
(a)
the title to the land included in the leasehold strata plan is
registered in the name of a leasehold landlord,
(b)
the person applying to deposit the leasehold strata plan is the
registered lessee under the ground lease,
(c)

all the land subject to the ground lease is shown on the leasehold

(a)
assign to the leasehold strata plan a serial deposit number, and
(b)
register new indefeasible titles in the name of the leasehold landlord
for each of the strata lots shown on the plan.
Conversion of ground lease
203
(1)
The deposit of the leasehold strata plan operates as a conversion of
the ground lease into individual leases of the leasehold landlord's
interest in each strata lot, including its share in the common
property,
(a)
in the form of the model strata lot lease attached to the ground
lease, and
(b)
granted to the owner developer by the leasehold landlord.
(2)
The conversion of the ground lease does not affect the obligations of
the owner developer and the leasehold landlord under the ground lease.
Signature of leasehold landlord not required
204
The signature of the leasehold landlord is not required for an
assignment of a strata lot lease by the owner developer, unless the
ground lease provides otherwise.
Obligations under strata lot lease
205
A leasehold tenant
(a)
is conclusively deemed to have agreed with the leasehold landlord to
observe the terms and conditions contained in the strata lot lease,
and
(b)
despite any agreement to the contrary, is not bound by anything
contained in the ground lease that is not also contained in the strata
lot lease.
Restrictions on lease, assignment or occupancy of strata lot
206
(1)
The leasehold landlord may impose restrictions on the lease,
assignment or occupancy of the strata lots included in a leasehold
strata plan.
(2)
A restriction
(a)
has no effect unless it is set out in a schedule of restrictions and
filed in the land title office at the time the strata plan is
deposited, and
(b)
comes into effect on the registration of the plan.
(3)
When a restriction is filed in accordance with subsection (2), it
binds the strata corporation and the leasehold tenant to the same
extent as if the schedule of restrictions contained binding agreements
on the part of the strata corporation and the leasehold tenant with
the leasehold landlord and with every other leasehold tenant to comply
in all respects with that schedule.
Change to restrictions
207
(1)
Subject to subsection (3), a leasehold landlord may, on its own or on
application by the strata corporation approved by a resolution passed
by a 3/4 vote at an annual or special general meeting, add to, alter
or repeal any of the restrictions referred to in section 206.
(2)
The amended schedule of restrictions has no effect until filed in a
land title office.
(3)
A leasehold landlord, other than the government of British Columbia,
may amend the schedule of restrictions only with the approval of the
Lieutenant Governor in Council.
(4)
The amendment of the restrictions on occupancy of a strata lot does
not affect persons who were leasehold tenants immediately before the
amendment, but affects persons who become leasehold tenants as a
result of the sublease or assignment of the strata lot lease after the
amendment.
Duties of strata corporation
208
(1)
On request of the leasehold landlord, the strata corporation must

required to do so under their strata lot leases,
(c)
repair and maintain the common property and common assets of the
strata corporation on behalf of the leasehold tenants to the extent
and standard that the leasehold tenants are required to do so under
their strata lot leases, and

require, to the extent that the leasehold tenants are required to do
so under their strata lot leases, the leasehold tenants to comply with
the following:
(i)
the bylaws and rules;
(ii)
this Act, the regulations or any other enactment or law;
(iii)
any restrictions imposed by the leasehold landlord under
sections 206 and 207.
(2)
On application by the leasehold landlord, the Supreme Court may order
the strata corporation to comply with a request made under subsection
(1).

requires the leasehold tenants to comply with the requirements of
their strata lot leases that are referred to in this section.
Leasehold landlord's remedies on leasehold tenant's default
209
(1)
Despite any agreement or enactment to the contrary, the leasehold
landlord is not entitled to reenter and take possession of the strata
lot or terminate the strata lot lease on a leasehold tenant's default
in performing obligations under the strata lot lease, but may apply to
the Supreme Court for an order for sale of the leasehold tenant's
interest in the strata lot.
(2)
On an application for sale, the court may
(a)
declare that the leasehold tenant failed to observe and perform
obligations under the strata lot lease, and specify the nature of the
default, and

order that, if the default is not corrected within the time period
required by the order, the leasehold landlord may sell the leasehold
tenant's interest in the strata lot at a price and on terms to be
approved by the court.

court may, by order, give directions it considers necessary for the
distribution of the proceeds and the delivery of possession.

most recent assessed values of all the strata lots included in the
leasehold strata plan.

Agreement on the rent for the renewal period must be reached by the
beginning of the renewal period unless expressly provided otherwise in

.
Renewal of fewer than 2/3 of strata lot leases

destroyed or damaged by more than 1/3 of their fair market value, the
leasehold tenants may elect not to rebuild by a resolution passed by a
3/4 vote at an annual or special general meeting.
(2)
When the leasehold tenants pass the resolution referred to in
subsection (1), all the strata lot leases terminate and the

214
(1)
The leasehold landlord must purchase a leasehold tenant's interest in
the strata lot on the termination of the strata lot lease.
(2)
The purchase price must be arrived at as of the date the strata lot

if a basis for calculating the purchase price was set out in the
strata lot lease or in a schedule filed with the leasehold strata
plan, the price calculated on that basis, or
(b)

strata lot lease or a schedule, the fair market value of the leasehold
tenant's interest in the strata lot evaluated, in accordance with the
regulations, as if the strata lot lease did not expire.

to in writing by the leasehold landlord and the leasehold tenant, the
purchase price under subsection (2) (b) must be determined,
despite section 175, by arbitration under the
Arbitration Act
if the leasehold landlord and the leasehold tenant have failed to
agree on the purchase price by 30 days before the date the strata lot
lease expires, or 30 days after the date of a termination under
section 213 (2).
(5)
The leasehold landlord must purchase the leasehold tenant's interest
in the strata lot within 30 days after the earlier of

the strata lots included in a ground lease to each of the leasehold
tenants and the registrar registers each leasehold tenant as the fee
simple owner of their strata lot described in the strata lot lease,
(a)
the strata plan continues as a strata plan and the land shown on the
strata plan is not subject to a ground lease,
(b)
the strata corporation continues as if it were originally created by
deposit of a strata plan that was not a leasehold strata plan,

the strata lot lease ceases to exist and the leasehold tenant and the
leasehold tenant's successors in interest cease to be liable for the
performance of obligations in the strata lot lease,
(d)
any charge in existence against the leasehold tenant's interest
immediately before the registration of the fee simple becomes a charge
against the fee simple estate acquired by the leasehold tenant, and,
if the charge was registered, the registrar must register it against
the fee simple title, and
(e)
any schedule of restrictions filed under section 206 is repealed and
the restrictions set out in it cease to apply.
