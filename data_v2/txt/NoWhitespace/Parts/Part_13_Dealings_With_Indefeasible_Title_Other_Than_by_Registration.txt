[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 250
Part 13 — Dealings With Indefeasible Title Other Than by Registration
Registration of new indefeasible title and change of name
191
(1)
On application by a person shown as a fee simple owner of land with
respect to which an indefeasible title has been registered and on
production of the duplicate indefeasible title, if any, accompanied by
proof satisfactory to the registrar that the name of that person has
been lawfully changed, and of the person's identity, the registrar
must cancel the existing indefeasible title and register a new
indefeasible title in the changed name of that person.
(2)
The registrar may, instead of the procedure set out in subsection (1),
endorse the change of name on the register.
(3)
On application by a person who is the registered owner of a charge,
and on production of proof satisfactory to the registrar that the name
of that person has been lawfully changed, and of the person's
identity, the registrar must endorse the change of name on the
register.
(4)
For the purposes of this section, a change of name is deemed to
include an amalgamation of 2 or more corporations, however effected,
and whether in respect of a beneficial or trust estate or interest in
land, and the continuing corporation following the amalgamation may
apply under subsection (1) or (3).
Registration of several indefeasible titles instead of original
192
(1)
On application by a registered owner of the fee simple and on the
surrender and cancellation of one or more duplicate indefeasible
titles, the registrar may cancel the title in the register, and
register in the name of the owner, subject to the restrictions of
sections 158 and 178, one or more indefeasible titles
collectively covering the land included in the surrendered titles and,
respectively, covering that part of the land that the owner may
direct.
(2)
On application by a registered owner whose title is subject to one or
more cancelled charges, and on the surrender and cancellation of the
registered owner's duplicate indefeasible title, the registrar may
cancel the subsisting title and register a new indefeasible title.
(3)
On application by tenants in common, the registrar may, in the same
manner as provided in subsection (1),
(a)
consolidate in one indefeasible title the undivided interests to which
the applicants are entitled, or
(b)
unless the separation would result in the same person being the
registered owner under separate indefeasible titles of all that
person's undivided interests, separate into several indefeasible
titles the undivided interests to which the applicants are entitled.
(4)
The holder of a duplicate indefeasible title on which the registrar
has endorsed a transfer of part of the land included in the
indefeasible title, may surrender it for cancellation under this
section and receive a new duplicate indefeasible title for the land or
interest remaining in the surrendered certificate.
(5)
The registrar may act under subsection (2) or (4) without an
application being made.
(6)
The registrar must note in the register all conditions, charges,
liens, interests and endorsements to which the respective land is
subject at the time of the application or of the registrar proceeding
under subsection (5).
Lost indefeasible certificate of title
193
(1)
On the registrar being satisfied by affidavit that a duplicate
indefeasible title has been lost or destroyed, and on advertisement of
the registrar's intention published for such time in one or more
newspapers, or in the Gazette, or in both, as the registrar considers
necessary and proper, the registrar may issue a provisional
indefeasible title instead of the duplicate indefeasible title lost or
destroyed.
(2)
The provisional indefeasible title must contain an exact copy of the
corresponding indefeasible title kept in the register, and of every
endorsement on it, and must state the reason why it is issued and
refer to the document filed as evidence of loss or destruction by its
filing number.
(3)
The registrar must note on the register the issue of the provisional
indefeasible title and the date of issue and refer to the document
filed as evidence of loss or destruction by its filing number.
(4)
The registrar may dispense with the advertisement of intention or may
substitute the posting of a notice in the land title office if the
registrar is satisfied of the destruction of the duplicate
indefeasible title or of its loss under such circumstances that it
could not fall into other hands and that advertisement may safely be
dispensed with.
(5)
The registrar may, on the surrender of a defaced or mutilated
duplicate indefeasible title, issue a provisional indefeasible title
in place of it.
Effect given to new or provisional indefeasible title
194
A new indefeasible title or provisional indefeasible title registered
or issued under sections 191 to 193 is available for all purposes
and uses for which the former indefeasible title or duplicate
indefeasible title, as the case may be, would have been available, and
in respect of the land or interest included in it is as valid and
effectual as the former indefeasible title or duplicate indefeasible
title, and relates back to the date of registration or issue of the
former indefeasible title or duplicate indefeasible title.
Surrender of duplicate indefeasible title on registration of charge
195
(1)
On an application to register a charge by way of mortgage or agreement
for sale, the duplicate indefeasible title, if any, must be
surrendered to the registrar for cancellation.
(2)
When all charges referred to in subsection (1) appearing in the
register have been cancelled, the registrar may, on request of the
registered owner in fee simple, issue to the registered owner a
duplicate indefeasible title and deliver it to the registered owner or
that owner's nominee.
Provisional title may issue to minerals
196
Sections 193 to 195 apply to a certificate of title to minerals.
