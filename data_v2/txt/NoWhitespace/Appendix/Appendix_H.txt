Parcel Description of Rights of Refusal Lands
Note: The parcel descriptions listed below are based on the most
accurate information available to define the parcels. The information
will be updated before the Effective Date following a survey of some
or all of the parcels. In some cases, the parcel descriptions will be
amended to include road dedications and the granting of rights of ways
or easements for existing interests. This could result in the area of
some or all of the parcels being slightly reduced and the
corresponding titles being slightly more encumbered. Before the
readying of the parcels for disposition, British Columbia will meet
with Tsawwassen First Nation to discuss steps to be taken for readying
the parcels for disposition.

costs and expenses of the appraisal commissioned by it.
