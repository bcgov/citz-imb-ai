instrument (hereinafter referred to as the "Land") for the purpose of
public access to the dike on the Land for which the Transferor is the

AND WHEREAS
the statutory right of way herein granted is necessary for the operation
and maintenance of the Transferee's undertaking;
NOW THEREFORE,
for valuable consideration and the covenants of the Transferee, the
parties agree as follows:
1.0 Grant of Statutory Right of Way
1.1 The Transferor, on the terms set forth herein, hereby grants to the
Transferee, in perpetuity, the non-exclusive statutory right of way
(herein called the

) over the Land for the Transferee, its licensees, agents, employees,
invitees and permittees (including the general public) between dawn and
dusk at their will and pleasure to:
(a) enter, go, be, return, pass and repass on, over, through and along
the Land by foot, for access to and use of the Land, for recreational
activity purposes; and
(b) do all acts or things necessary or incidental to the foregoing;
to have and to hold unto the Transferee, from and after the date of this
Agreement, unless and until discharged by the Transferee in accordance
with section 1.2, provided that nothing in this Agreement grants to the
Transferee, its licensees, agents, employees, invitees and permittees
(including the general public) the right to construct any improvements
or destroy any vegetation in or on the Land.
1.2 All of the rights, licences, liberties, privileges, easements and
statutory rights of way granted in this Agreement will exist and
continue in perpetuity unless and until discharged by the Transferee.
1.3 The rights, licences, liberties, privileges, easements, statutory
rights of way and covenants in this Agreement will run with and bind the
Land, in perpetuity.
2.0 Restriction of Right of Way
2.1 The Transferee acknowledges and agrees that the Right of Way over
the Land set forth in section 1.1 will be exercised only over those
portions of the Land shown outlined in bold on the sketch plan attached
as Schedule "A" ("Right of Way Area"), and the Transferee will not
otherwise exercise or otherwise attempt to exercise its Right of Way
over the Land under section 1.1.
2.2 The Right of Way granted by section 1.1 will be subject to the right
of the Transferor to:
(a) use the Right of Way Area in a manner that does not disrupt or
interfere with the Transferee, its licensees, agents, employees,
invitees and permittees (including the general public) in the exercise
of rights under this Agreement; and
(b) restrict access to the Right of Way Area on a temporary basis from
time to time as may be reasonably required for the maintenance and
operation of the dike.

or maintain any building, structure, foundation, pavement, excavation,
well, pile of material, obstruction, equipment, thing or inflammable
substance, or plant any growth upon the Right of Way Area, if any such
action or thing, in the reasonable opinion of the Transferee:
(i) may obstruct access to the Right of Way Area or any part thereof by
those authorized by the Transferee; or
(ii) may by its operation, use, maintenance or existence on the Right of
Way Area create or increase any hazard to persons or property in
relation to the Right of Way Area.

Agreement, the notice or document shall be in writing and shall be

address in accordance with this section.

may only be waived in writing and any such waiver shall not be construed
as or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach. Consent or
approval of any act where consent or approval is required under this

subsequent similar act.
5.2 The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall extend to, be
binding upon and enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

be at risk from the Works, and in that event Hydro will as soon as
reasonably possible thereafter notify the Grantor; and
E. generally, do all such other acts or things as may reasonably be
necessary or incidental to the business of Hydro in connection with any
of the foregoing.
3.0 Right of Way Area
3.1 The parties acknowledge that they have made reasonable efforts to
identify all the existing Works and related Right of Way Area as of the
date of this Agreement. However, as there may still be some Works that
were missed in the identification process the parties agree that for
such Works the Grantor grants to Hydro for so long as required, a right
of way over those portions of the Lands upon which such Works are
located on the following terms:
(a) for such Works, Hydro holds the same rights, privileges and
obligations as apply to Hydro for the use of the Right of Way Area and
the Area of the Works under this Agreement, including the right of
reasonable access over the Lands for the purpose of gaining access to
such Works; and
(b) the Grantor may at any time require Hydro to attach a revised survey
plan to this Agreement to include those additional portions of the
Lands.
4.0 Non-Exclusive Use
4.1 This Agreement will not entitle Hydro to exclusive possession of the
Hydro Right of Way Area or other parts of the Lands and the Grantor
reserves the right to grant other dispositions of any Lands affected by
this Agreement, so long as the grant does not materially affect or
interfere with the exercise of Hydro's rights under this Agreement.
5.0 Protection of the Environment
5.1 Hydro will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement
having regard for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent
measures to minimize the danger or disruption to the Environment.
6.0 Covenants of Hydro
6.1 Hydro covenants separately with the Grantor that:
(a) Hydro shall pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies,
charges and assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to
the account of Hydro which relate to the Works and which Hydro is liable
to pay;
(b) Hydro shall keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro under this
Agreement in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the
condition relates to the use or occupation of the Lands by Hydro, and on
written notice from the Grantor, to make safe, clean, and sanitary any
portion of them that contravene the provisions of this covenant,
provided that Hydro has no obligation to keep any portion of the Lands
suitable for use by anyone except Hydro;
(c) Hydro shall bury and maintain all underground works as may be
required so as not to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(d) Hydro shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize
disturbance of any archaeological material discovered by Hydro on the
Right of Way Area, and to immediately notify the Grantor;
(e) Hydro shall not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in
excavations or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary
structures as backfilling proceeds;
(f) Hydro shall not commit or suffer any wilful or voluntary waste,
spoil or destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be
done thereon anything that may be or become a nuisance or annoyance to
the Grantor, except to the extent required by Hydro acting reasonably,
to exercise its rights under this Agreement; and
(g) Hydro shall permit the Grantor to enter upon the Right of Way Area
at any time to examine its condition.
7.0 Work Plans
7.1 Except in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended
emergency, Hydro will provide to the Grantor a written work plan
describing the proposed work located on, outside or related to the Right
of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work under this
Agreement:
(a) construction of any new Works;
(b) relocation of any Works; and
(c) construction or relocation of any Access Improvements.
In accordance with this section 7.1, prior to undertaking any work,
Hydro will deliver a copy of the work plan to the Grantor for comment by
the Grantor. The Grantor will no more than thirty (30) days after
receiving the work plan, provide to Hydro in writing any comments that
it may have, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to accommodate any
suggestions or requests presented by the Grantor to Hydro provided they
do not result in delays, increased costs or technical difficulties.
8.0 Relocation of Works Due to Change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way
Area or the Excluded Right of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works,
then the Grantor will consent to the relocation and replacement of such
Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:
(a) Hydro will before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the
Grantor indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for approval
by the Grantor, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned;
(b) Hydro will take into account any likely material effect of the
relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into
account the cost efficiencies of the location selected by Hydro for the
relocated Works in relation to alternative locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and
(d) if Works are relocated from the Excluded Right of Way Area to the
Lands Hydro will pay the Grantor the fair market value of the new Right
of Way Area provided the Grantor has not caused any portion of such
Excluded Right of Way Area to become unsuitable for any of the Works.
9.0 Relocation of Works at the Request of the Grantor
9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right of Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Hydro will relocate
any Works in the Right of Way Area to a new location on the Lands,

on the Lands, and such damage is not caused as a result of the Grantor's
breach of the terms of this Agreement or the negligence or willful act
of the Grantor or its contractors, agents or permittees, that Hydro
will:
(a) compensate the Grantor for such damages, to the extent caused by
Hydro; or
(b) within a reasonable period of time, repair in a good and

be referred to a single arbitrator for final resolution in accordance
with the provisions of the British Columbia
Commercial Arbitration Act
. If the parties do not agree to arbitration, then any party may refer

persons or property in relation to the Works;
(c) to enjoy further rights as follows:
(i) Hydro and TELUS may, with the prior approval of the Grantor and any

Works (whether on or off the Lands) or pose a hazard to persons or
property in relation to the Works;
(ii) Hydro and TELUS may pass and repass over, and maintain, repair

(iv) to conduct vegetation management upon the Area of the Works, such
as the planting of vegetation compatible with the undertakings of Hydro
or TELUS, and the application of herbicides and pesticides, provided

required to be taken immediately in order to protect the Works, or to
protect persons or property that may be at risk from the Works, and in
that event Hydro or TELUS will as soon as reasonably possible thereafter
notify the Grantor; and

(i) those Works existing at the date of this Agreement;
(ii) any additional Works constructed adjacent to, along the sides of or
across any roads, lanes or bridges from time to time existing on or
through the Lands;

consented to in writing by the Grantor, or by any delegate appointed by
the Grantor.
3.2 The parties agree that the sketch plan attached to this Agreement as
Schedule "C" reasonably represents the approximate location of the Works
existing as of the date of this Agreement. As and when new works are
added to the Lands by either or both of Hydro or TELUS, the parties will
update Schedule "C", it being the intention of the parties that this
Agreement, and all of its terms and provisions, apply to such new works
in their entirety.

of any lands for the construction, operation and maintenance of the
Works and all matters incidental thereto.
4.0 Non-Exclusive Use

(b) subject to the rights granted to Hydro and TELUS in this Agreement,
the Grantor may grant to third parties other interests on the Area of
the Works, provided that any such grant of other interests shall not
compromise or, by action of the Grantor or the grantee, damage, disrupt,
adversely affect or interfere with the use by Hydro and TELUS of the
Works or Area of the Works.

Area and which Hydro or TELUS is liable to pay;
(b) keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro or TELUS under this
Agreement in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the

Lands, as the case may be, provided that Hydro and TELUS have no
obligation to keep any roads within the Area of the Works suitable for
use by anyone except Hydro and TELUS;
(c) bury and maintain all underground works as may be required so as not
to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(d) take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize disturbance of
any archaeological material discovered by Hydro or TELUS on the Right of

destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon
anything that may be or become a nuisance to the Grantor, except to the
extent required by Hydro or TELUS, acting reasonably, to exercise the
rights granted under this Agreement.
7.0 New Works Constructed by Hydro or TELUS
7.1 Prior to undertaking construction on the Lands of any new Works
which are not alterations, extensions or additions to existing Works,
Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will deliver to the Grantor for
prior approval, a sketch plan showing with reasonable accuracy the
location of such new Works, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.
8.0 Relocation of Hydro and TELUS Works Due to Change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way
Area or an Excluded Right of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works,
then the Grantor will, at no cost to Hydro and TELUS, consent to the
relocation and replacement of such Works to a new location on the Lands,
as follows:
(a) Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will, before undertaking any
work, deliver a sketch plan to the Grantor indicating the contemplated
relocation of the Works for approval by the Grantor, which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
(b) Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will take into account any
likely material effect of the relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the
Grantor will take into account the cost efficiencies of the location
selected by Hydro or TELUS for the relocated Works in relation to
alternative locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and
(d) subject to the foregoing, the cost of such relocation will be borne
by Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be.

conditions of this Agreement.
10.0 Relocation of TELUS Works at the Request of the Grantor
10.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right of Way Area for
other purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, TELUS will
relocate any Works in the Right of Way Area to a new location on the
Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of TELUS, suitable
for use for the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance

on or adjacent to the Area of the Works without prior written permission
from Hydro and TELUS, which permission will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; and

conditioned or delayed.
16.0 Compensation for Damages
16.1 Subject to the rights granted in this Agreement, Hydro and TELUS
covenant with the Grantor that if Hydro or TELUS damage any structures,
buildings, fixtures, improvements, or chattels outside of the Area of
the Works, or damage any crops, merchantable timber, livestock, drains,
ditches, culverts, fences, trails, bridges, or roads on the Lands, and
such damage is not caused as a result of the Grantor's breach of the
terms of this Agreement or the negligence or willful act of the Grantor

case may be, will:
(a) compensate the Grantor for such damages, to the extent caused by

damaged by Hydro or TELUS on the Lands or outside of the Area of the
Works and the parties agree that on payment, title to any timber cut on
the Lands under this Agreement will vest in Hydro or TELUS, as the case
may be.
17.0 Indemnity
17.1 Hydro will at all times save harmless and indemnify and keep
indemnified the Grantor from and against all claims, demands, actions,
suits or other legal proceedings by whomsoever made or brought against
the Grantor by reason of or arising out of:

covenants, conditions or obligations under this Agreement; and
(b) any act or omission on the part of Hydro in respect of or in
relation to its Works including the construction, maintenance, operation
or decommissioning of its Works, but only to the extent any such matter
is found to be the responsibility of Hydro and was not contributed to by
the negligence, breach, violation or non-performance of the Grantor, and
not for any matters based on nuisance or the rule in
Rylands v. Fletcher
unless Hydro was negligent.
17.2 TELUS will at all times save harmless and indemnify and keep
indemnified the Grantor from and against all claims, demands, actions,
suits or other legal proceedings by whomsoever made or brought against
the Grantor by reason of or arising out of:
(a) any breach, violation or non-performance by TELUS of any of TELUS'
covenants, conditions or obligations under this Agreement; or
(b) any act or omission on the part of TELUS in respect of or in
relation to its Works including the construction, maintenance, operation
or decommissioning of its Works, but only to the extent any such matter
is found to be the responsibility of TELUS and was not contributed to by
the negligence, breach, violation or non-performance of the Grantor.

referred to a single arbitrator for final resolution in accordance with
the provisions of the British Columbia Commercial Arbitration Act. If
the parties do not agree to arbitration, then any party may refer the
matter to a court of competent jurisdiction; except that it is not
incompatible with this subsection for a party to apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction at any time for interim or conservatory relief
and for the court to grant that relief; and
(d) for the purposes of this section 18.1, Hydro and TELUS will only be
considered as one party where the dispute arises between the Grantor, on

2.0 Grant of Right-of-Way
2.1 Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Grantor grants a
Right-of-Way over the Lands to Terasen commencing on the date written
above and continuing for so long as any of the Right-of-Way is required
by Terasen, which Right-of-Way shall confer on Terasen, the right,
privilege, liberty and permit to:
(a) use the Works Area as follows:
(i) to excavate for, construct, install, erect, abandon, replace,
extend, upgrade, operate, maintain, alter, remove and repair the Works
on, over, under, across and through the Works Area;
(ii) to clear the Works Area and keep it cleared (including pruning or
removal) of any trees or growth at any time located therein; and
(iii) generally, to do all such other acts or things on the Works Area
as may reasonably be necessary or incidental to the business of Terasen
in connection with any of the foregoing;
(b) use the Area of the Works as follows:
(i) to enter, work, inspect, patrol, pass and repass upon, on, and along
the Area of the Works;
(ii) to clear the Area of the Works and keep it cleared of all or any
part of any obstruction, improvement or other matter which, in the
reasonable opinion of Terasen, might interfere with or endanger the
Works, disrupt service to Terasen's customers, or pose a hazard to the
Works or persons in relation to the Works;
(iii) to clear the Area of the Works and keep it cleared (including
pruning or removal) of all or any part of any trees or growth which do
or might, in the reasonable opinion of Terasen, interfere with or
endanger the Works, disrupt service to Terasen's customers, or pose a
hazard to the Works or persons in relation to the Works; and
(c) to enjoy further rights as follows:
(i) Terasen may, with the prior written consent of the Grantor, and any
party with a registered interest in the affected areas, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, cut trees outside
the Area of the Works, if in the reasonable opinion of Terasen such
trees would threaten to damage the Works or pose a hazard to the Works
or persons in relation to the Works;
(ii) Terasen may pass and repass over existing roads on the Lands for
access to and from the Area of the Works, and in the event that such
roads become closed to the public for any reason, the Grantor shall
nonetheless provide Terasen access to such roads for the purpose for
ingress and egress to and from the Area of the Works, to the extent
reasonably practicable, or to such alternative access as may be
available, at no additional cost to Terasen;
(iii) If no such road access is available, Terasen may have access to
and over other portions of the Lands for access to and from the Area of
the Works, provided that such access has been approved by the Grantor,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and by any
other person having an interest in such portion or portions; provided
that such approval is not required if access is necessary for
determining consumption or usage of services, in emergency situations or
for normal surveillance or safety inspection purposes;
(iv) Terasen may enter onto the Lands outside the Area of the Works for
the purpose of undertaking works to protect any Works located within the
Lands or within an Excluded Area or to protect persons and property that
may be at risk from such Works, provided that:
A. Terasen will deliver to the Grantor for prior approval a written work
plan describing the proposed work on the Lands;
B. the Grantor will not unreasonably withhold or delay approval of such
work plan and will not impose any unreasonable conditions relating to
the granting of such approval and shall take into consideration the
effect of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to
the cost of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not
undertaking the work. If Terasen and the Grantor, each acting
reasonably, cannot agree on a work plan within 30 days of receipt by the
Grantor of the work plan proposed by Terasen, then either party may
refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under section 17.1 of this
Agreement; and
C. in the event that any damage to the Lands results from the
implementation of the work plan by Terasen, Terasen will repair and
restore the damaged portion of the Lands as near as is reasonably
feasible, to their condition prior to the implementation of the work
plan or, at Terasen's discretion, pay to the Grantor appropriate
compensation in respect of such damage.
2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Terasen determines in its
reasonable judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are
imminent safety concerns or risk of public harm, Terasen may, without
approval of the Grantor, undertake works and take such steps on the
Lands as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to
protect the Works located within the Lands or within an Excluded Area,
or to protect persons and property that may be at risk from such Works,
and in that event Terasen will as soon as reasonably possible thereafter
notify the Grantor.
3.0 Works Area
3.1 The Works Area consists of all portions of the Lands reasonably
required by Terasen for the following:
(a) those Works existing at the date of this Agreement;
(b) any additional Works constructed adjacent to, along the sides of and
across any of the Grantor's roads from time to time existing on or
through the Lands;
(c) any additional Works that provide services to any lands adjacent to
any roads from time to time existing on or through the Lands; and
any such other portions of the Lands as are from time to time consented
to in writing by the Grantor, or any delegate appointed by the Grantor.
3.2 The parties agree that the sketch plan attached to this Agreement as
Schedule "C" reasonably represents the Works existing as of the date of
this Agreement. As and when new works are added to the Lands by Terasen,
the parties will update Schedule "C" to reflect such new works, it being
the intention of the parties for this Agreement and all of its terms and
provisions to apply to such new works in their entirety.
3.3 Nothing in this Part 3.0 is intended to affect the rights of Terasen
to make arrangements directly with a person in legal possession of any
lands for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Works and
all matters incidental thereto.
4.0 Non-Exclusive Use
4.1 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Terasen
acknowledges and agrees that:
(a) this Agreement does not grant a fee simple interest in the Lands to
or in favour of Terasen; and
(b) the Grantor may grant to third parties other interests on the
Right-of-Way Area upon prior written notice to Terasen, provided that
any such grant of other interests shall not compromise or, by action of
the Grantor or the grantee, damage, disrupt, adversely affect or
interfere with the use by Terasen of the Works or Right-of-Way Area.
5.0 Protection of the Environment
5.1 Terasen will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement
having regard for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent
measures to minimize the danger or disruption to the Environment.
6.0 Covenants of Terasen
6.1 Terasen covenants with the Grantor to:
(a) pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies, charges and
assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account
of Terasen, which relate to the Right-of-Way Area and which Terasen is
liable to pay;
(b) keep the Right-of-Way Area, and any Works, in a safe, clean and
sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Right-of-Way Area by Terasen, provided that Terasen
has no obligation to keep any roads within the Right-of-Way Area
suitable for use by anyone except Terasen;
(c) bury and maintain all underground Works as may be required so as not
to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(d) take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize disturbance of
any archaeological material discovered by Terasen on the Right-of-Way
Area, and to immediately notify the Grantor;
(e) not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in excavations
or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as
backfilling proceeds; and
(f) not commit or suffer any willful or voluntary waste, spoil or
destruction on the Right-of-Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon
anything that may be or become a nuisance or annoyance to the Grantor,
except to the extent required by Terasen, acting reasonably, to exercise
the rights granted herein.
7.0 New Works Constructed by Terasen
7.1 Prior to undertaking construction on the Lands of any new Works
which are not alterations, extensions or additions to existing Works,
Terasen, will deliver to the Grantor for prior approval, a sketch plan
showing with reasonable accuracy the location of any new Works, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
8.0 Relocation of Works Due to Change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right-of-Way
Area unsuitable for the continued operation and maintenance of any of
the Works, then the Grantor will consent, which consent will be, at no
cost to Terasen, to the relocation and replacement of such Works to a
new location on the Lands, as follows:
(a) Terasen will, before undertaking any work, deliver a sketch plan to
the Grantor indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for
approval by the Grantor, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable conditions;
(b) Terasen will take into account any likely material adverse effect of
the relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into
account the cost efficiencies of the location selected by Terasen for
the relocated Works in relation to alternative locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and
(d) subject to the foregoing, the cost of such relocation will be borne
by Terasen.
9.0 Relocation of Works at the request of the Grantor
9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right-of-Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Terasen will
relocate any Works in the Right-of-Way Area to a new location on the
Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Terasen, suitable
for use for the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance
and operation, and cost factors;
(b) the Grantor gives Terasen reasonable notice to permit proper design,
planning and construction of the Works to be relocated;
(c) the Grantor agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses,
including costs of design, supervision and construction (before any
relocation, the Grantor will pay the costs and expenses as estimated by
Terasen, with appropriate adjustments made based on actuals after the
relocation is complete); and
(d) without any further action required on the part of the parties, a
new Right-of-Way will be deemed to have been established upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, which will apply to and cover such
relocated Works.

the Works or persons in relation to the Works;
(ii) Delta Cable may pass and repass over existing roads on the Lands
for access to and from the Area of the Works, and in the event that such
roads become closed to the public for any reason, the Grantor shall

effect of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to
the cost of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not
undertaking the work. If Delta Cable and the Grantor, each acting
reasonably, cannot agree on a work plan within 30 days of receipt by the
Grantor of the work plan proposed by Delta Cable, then either party may
refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under section 17.1 of this
Agreement; and

compensation in respect of such damage.

reasonable judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are
imminent safety concerns or risk of public harm, Delta Cable may,
without approval of the Grantor, undertake works and take such steps on
the Lands as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to
protect the Works located within the Lands or within an Excluded Area,
or to protect persons and property that may be at risk from such Works,

any roads from time to time existing on or through the Lands; and
any such other portions of the Lands as are from time to time consented
to in writing by the Grantor, or any delegate appointed by the Grantor.

Schedule "C" reasonably represents the Works existing as of the date of
this Agreement. As and when new works are added to the Lands by Delta
Cable, the parties will update Schedule "C" to reflect such new works,
it being the intention of the parties for this Agreement and all of its
terms and provisions to apply to such new works in their entirety.
3.3 Nothing in this Part 3.0 is intended to affect the rights of Delta
Cable to make arrangements directly with a person in legal possession of
any lands for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Works
and all matters incidental thereto.

or in favour of Delta Cable; and
(b) the Grantor may grant to third parties other interests on the

or interfere with the use by Delta Cable of the Works or Right-of-Way
Area.
5.0 Protection of the Environment
5.1 Delta Cable will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement
having regard for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent
measures to minimize the danger or disruption to the Environment.

assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account
of Delta Cable, which relate to the Right-of-Way Area and which Delta
Cable is liable to pay;
(b) keep the Right-of-Way Area, and any Works, in a safe, clean and
sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Right-of-Way Area by Delta Cable, provided that Delta

suitable for use by anyone except Delta Cable;
(c) bury and maintain all underground Works as may be required so as not
to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;

(e) not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in excavations
or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as

except to the extent required by Delta Cable, acting reasonably, to
exercise the rights granted herein.

plan showing with reasonable accuracy the location of any new Works,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.
8.0 Relocation of Works Due to Change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right-of-Way
Area unsuitable for the continued operation and maintenance of any of
the Works, then the Grantor will consent, which consent will be, at no
cost to Delta Cable, to the relocation and replacement of such Works to
a new location on the Lands, as follows:

to the Grantor indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for
approval by the Grantor, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable conditions;

effect of the relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will
take into account the cost efficiencies of the location selected by
Delta Cable for the relocated Works in relation to alternative
locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and
(d) subject to the foregoing, the cost of such relocation will be borne
by Delta Cable.
9.0 Relocation of Works at the request of the Grantor
9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right-of-Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Delta Cable will
relocate any Works in the Right-of-Way Area to a new location on the
Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Delta Cable,
suitable for use for the relocated Works considering construction,
maintenance and operation, and cost factors;
(b) the Grantor gives Delta Cable reasonable notice to permit proper
design, planning and construction of the Works to be relocated;

Delta Cable, with appropriate adjustments made, based on actuals, after
the relocation is complete); and
(d) without any further action required on the part of the parties, a
new Right-of-Way will be deemed to have been established upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, which will apply to and cover such
relocated Works.

10.1 Except for the purpose of protecting any necessary above ground
Works, Delta Cable will not fence the Right-of-Way Area without the
prior consent of the Grantor. Any present or future lessees or
permittees having any rights with respect to the Right-of-Way Area are,
subject to the rights granted to Delta Cable herein, to be allowed free
access to the Right-of-Way Area and the use of the same except for:
(a) making, placing, erecting or maintaining any building, structure,
excavation, pile of material or obstruction or planning any growth on
the Area of the Works which, in the reasonable opinion of Delta Cable
might interfere with or endanger the construction, operation,
maintenance or removal of the Works or might reasonably obstruct access
by Delta Cable to the Works; or
(b) doing any act or thing that might reasonably interfere with or
damage the Works or create or increase any hazards to persons in
relation to the Works.

Agreement.

may, subject to the consent of the Grantor, abandon the Works and
transfer to the Grantor all ownership, right and interest in the whole

Agreement, Delta Cable will remove the Works, where practicable, as soon
as reasonably possible in the circumstances.
