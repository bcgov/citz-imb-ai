Appendix B — Party and Party Costs
[am. B.C. Reg. 277/2023, Sch. 1, s. 6.]
Interpretation
1
In this Appendix,
"process"
means the drawing, filing or service of a document and any amendment
to it or particulars of it, but does not include an application made
with respect to the process or any part of the process.
Scale of costs
2
(1)
If a court has made an order for costs, it may fix the scale, from
Scale A to Scale C in subsection (2), under which the costs will be
assessed, and may order that one or more steps in the proceeding be
assessed under a different scale from that fixed for other steps.
(2)
In fixing the scale of costs, the court must have regard to the
following principles:
(a)
Scale A is for matters of little or less than ordinary difficulty;
(b)
Scale B is for matters of ordinary difficulty;
(c)
Scale C is for matters of more than ordinary difficulty.
(3)
In fixing the appropriate scale under which costs will be assessed,
the court may take into account the following:
(a)
whether a difficult issue of law, fact or construction is involved;
(b)
whether an issue is of importance to a class or body of persons, or is
of general interest;
(c)
whether the result of the proceeding effectively determines the rights
and obligations as between the parties beyond the relief that was
actually granted or denied.
(4)
If, after December 31, 2006, a settlement is reached under which
payment of assessed costs is agreed to or an order for costs is made,
and if no scale is fixed or agreed to in that settlement or order, the
costs must be assessed under Scale B, unless a party, on application,
obtains an order of the court that the costs be assessed under another
scale.
(5)
If, after it fixes the scale of costs applicable to a proceeding under
subsection (1) or (4), the court finds that, as a result of unusual
circumstances, an award of costs on that scale would be grossly
inadequate or unjust, the court may order that the value for each unit
allowed for that proceeding, or for any step in that proceeding, be
1.5 times the value that would otherwise apply to a unit in that scale
under section 3 (1).
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (5) of this section, an award of costs
is not grossly inadequate or unjust merely because there is a
difference between the actual legal expenses of a party and the costs
to which that party would be entitled under the scale of costs fixed
under subsection (1) or (4).
(7)
If costs may be assessed without order or agreement, the scale of
costs must be fixed by the registrar on the assessment.
(8)
If an offer to settle is made under Rule 9-1, any costs payable on
acceptance of that offer must be assessed under Scale B.
Value of units
3
(1)
The value for each unit allowed on an assessment conducted after
December 31, 2006 in relation to orders and settlements made after
that date is as follows:
(a)
Scale A — $60;
(b)
Scale B — $110;
(c)
Scale C — $170.
(2)
If maximum and minimum numbers of units are provided for in an Item in
the Tariff, the registrar has the discretion to allow a number within
that range of units.
(3)
If the Tariff indicates a range of units for a Tariff Item, the
registrar must have regard to the following principles:
(a)
one unit is for matters on which little time should ordinarily have
been spent;
(b)
the maximum number of units is for matters on which a great deal of
time should ordinarily have been spent.
Daily rates
4
(1)
If, in a Tariff Item, a number of units is allowed for each day but
the time spent during a day is not more than 2 1/2 hours,
only 1/2 of the number of units is to be allowed for that day.
(2)
If, in a Tariff Item, a number of units is allowed for each day but
the time spent during a day is more than 5 hours, the number of
units allowed for that day is to be increased by 1/2 of the number.
(3)
If, in a Tariff Item, a number of units is allowed for preparation for
an attendance but the time spent on the attendance is not more than
2 1/2 hours, only 1/2 of the number of units for preparation
is to be allowed.
(4)
If, in the Tariff, units may be allowed for preparation for an
activity, the registrar may allow units for preparation for an
activity that does not take place or is adjourned up to the maximum
allowable for one day.
Uncontested foreclosure proceedings
5
In a proceeding under Rule 21-7, uncontested at the hearing on any
issue except costs, the costs must be assessed under Scale A.
Default judgment and process for execution
6
(1)
Schedule 1 applies to the costs that may be assessed on a default
judgment entered under Rule 3-8.
(2)
The amount involved under subsection (1) is the amount for which the
judgment is entered.
(3)
If a writ of execution or garnishing order, or a process in Form 56,
58 or 59, is issued, the costs must be endorsed on the process and
allowed in accordance with Schedule 2, instead of Item 42.
(4)
The amount involved under subsection (3) is the amount payable, if
any, that is endorsed on the process.
(5)
In addition to the fees set out in Schedules 1 and 2, the costs of any
application to the court relating to the judgment or to the process
for execution may be ordered to be assessed under the Tariff.
Apportionment if proceedings tried together
7
If 2 or more proceedings have, by order, been tried at the same time
or tried one after the other and no order has been made as to
apportionment of costs, the registrar may
(a)
assess 2 or more bills as one bill,
(b)
allow an item once or more than once, or
(c)
apportion the costs of an item or of the whole bill between the
proceedings.
Offer to settle bill of costs
8
A party to an assessment may serve on another party an offer to settle
the amount of the bill of costs in Form 123 and, after the assessment
has been completed, may produce the offer to the registrar, and the
registrar must determine whether the offer should have been accepted
and, if so, may disallow items of the Tariff that relate to the
assessment to the party presenting the bill, and
(a)
allow, by way of set-off, items of the Tariff that relate to the
assessment to the party making the offer, or
(b)
allow double the value of items of the Tariff that relate to the
assessment to the party presenting the bill and making the offer.
