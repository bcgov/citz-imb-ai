SECURITY FOR RECEIVER
[Rule 22-3 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules applies to all forms.]
Date of this guarantee: ........[
dd/mmm/yyyy
]........
Name and address of receiver:
...................................................................
Name and registered office of surety:
.......................................................
Liability of surety under this guarantee: $......................
Annual premium: $......................
This guarantee is made between the RECEIVER, THE SURETY AND HER MAJESTY
THE QUEEN in right of British Columbia.
1
The receiver and the surety hereby jointly and severally covenant
with Her Majesty the Queen in right of British Columbia that the
receiver will, from time to time, duly account for what the
receiver has already received since the date of the order
appointing the receiver and will hereafter receive or for what
since the date of the order the receiver has or will hereafter
become liable to pay or account for as receiver [
and manager
] and will pay every sum of money and deliver every property that
the court may direct.
2
If the receiver does not, for every successive 12 months
computed from the date of the receiver's appointment, pay at the
office of the surety the annual premium noted above, then the
surety may apply to be relieved from all further liability under
this guarantee, except in respect of any damage or loss occasioned
by any act or default of the receiver in relation to the
receiver's duties as receiver [
and manager
] prior to the hearing and determination of the application.
3
A statement under the hand of the registrar of the amount that the
receiver is liable to pay and has not paid under paragraph 1 and
that the loss or damage has been incurred through the act or
default of the receiver is conclusive evidence in any action by
Her Majesty against the receiver and surety, or either of them, or
by the surety against the receiver, of the truth of the contents
of the statement and constitutes a binding charge not only against
