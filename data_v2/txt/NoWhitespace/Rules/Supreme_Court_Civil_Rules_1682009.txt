the burden of disproving the fact lies on the other party.

denied it in the other party's pleadings.
Matters arising since start of proceeding
(5)

proceeding.
Inconsistent allegations
(6)
A party must not plead an allegation of fact or a new ground or claim

of a party is specifically denied, it is deemed to be admitted.
Set-off or counterclaim
(11)
A defendant in an action may set off or set up by way of counterclaim
any right or claim, whether the set-off or counterclaim is for damages
or not, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final judgment on all
claims in the same action.
Pleading after the notice of civil claim
(12)
In a pleading subsequent to a notice of civil claim, a party must
plead specifically any matter of fact or point of law that
(a)

or
(c)
raises issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleading.

pleading of the opposite party, the party must not do so evasively but
must answer the point of substance.
Denial of contract
(16)
If a contract, promise or agreement is alleged in a pleading, a bare
denial of it by the opposite party is to be construed only as a denial
of fact of the express contract, promise or agreement alleged, or of
the matters of fact from which it may be implied by law, and not as a
denial of the legality or sufficiency in law of that contract, promise
or agreement.
Allegation of malice
(17)
It is sufficient to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge or
other condition of the mind of a person as a fact, without setting out
the circumstances from which it is to be inferred.
Particulars
When particulars necessary
(18)
If the party pleading relies on misrepresentation, fraud, breach of
trust, wilful default or undue influence, or if particulars may be
necessary, full particulars, with dates and items if applicable, must
be stated in the pleading.
Lengthy particulars
(19)
If the particulars required under subrule (18) of debt, expenses or
damages are lengthy, the party pleading may refer to this fact and,
instead of pleading the particulars, must serve the particulars in a
separate document either before or with the pleading.
Further particulars
(20)
Particulars need only be pleaded to the extent that they are known at
the date of pleading, but further particulars

plaintiff relies in support of that sense, and

if the defendant alleges that, insofar as the words complained of
consist of statements of fact, they are true in substance and in fact,

fair comment on a matter of public interest, the defendant must give
particulars stating which of the words complained of the defendant
alleges are statements of fact and of the facts and matters relied on
in support of the allegation that the words are true.
Order for particulars
(22)
The court may order a party to serve further and better particulars of
a matter stated in a pleading.
Demand for particulars
(23)
Before applying to the court for particulars, a party must demand them
in writing from the other party.
Demand for particulars not a stay of proceedings
(24)
A demand for particulars does not operate as a stay of proceedings or
give an extension of time, but a party may apply for an extension of
time for serving a responding pleading on the ground that the party
cannot answer the originating pleading until particulars are provided.

SECURITY FOR RECEIVER
[Rule 22-3 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules applies to all forms.]
Date of this guarantee: ........[
dd/mmm/yyyy
]........
Name and address of receiver:
...................................................................
Name and registered office of surety:
.......................................................
Liability of surety under this guarantee: $......................
Annual premium: $......................
This guarantee is made between the RECEIVER, THE SURETY AND HER MAJESTY
THE QUEEN in right of British Columbia.
1
The receiver and the surety hereby jointly and severally covenant
with Her Majesty the Queen in right of British Columbia that the
receiver will, from time to time, duly account for what the
receiver has already received since the date of the order
appointing the receiver and will hereafter receive or for what
since the date of the order the receiver has or will hereafter
become liable to pay or account for as receiver [
and manager
] and will pay every sum of money and deliver every property that
the court may direct.
2
If the receiver does not, for every successive 12 months
computed from the date of the receiver's appointment, pay at the
office of the surety the annual premium noted above, then the
surety may apply to be relieved from all further liability under
this guarantee, except in respect of any damage or loss occasioned
by any act or default of the receiver in relation to the
receiver's duties as receiver [
and manager
] prior to the hearing and determination of the application.
3
A statement under the hand of the registrar of the amount that the
receiver is liable to pay and has not paid under paragraph 1 and
that the loss or damage has been incurred through the act or
default of the receiver is conclusive evidence in any action by
Her Majesty against the receiver and surety, or either of them, or
by the surety against the receiver, of the truth of the contents
of the statement and constitutes a binding charge not only against
the receiver and the receiver's personal representatives, but also
against the surety and its funds and property without it being
necessary for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the
surety and the surety's funds and property and without it being
necessary for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the
receiver for the recovery thereof and without any further or other
proof being given in that behalf in any action to enforce this
guarantee.
4
The liability of the surety under this guarantee is limited to the
sum noted above, provided that the registrar may give his or her
approval in writing to the reduction of the liability of the
surety, in which event the surety's maximum liability with respect
to any acts or omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of
the approval is reduced accordingly and provided further that an
endorsement executed by the surety increasing the liability of the
surety will be binding on the surety with respect to any acts or
omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of that
endorsement.
5
The receiver will, on being discharged from office or on ceasing
to act as receiver [
and manager
], promptly give written notice of that discharge to the surety,
and also within 7 days after the notice give the surety a
copy of any order discharging the receiver.
6
The receiver and the receiver's personal representatives will at
all times hereafter indemnify the surety against all loss, damage,
costs, and expenses that the surety sustains by reason of the
surety having executed this guarantee.
In witness whereof, the receiver has hereunder set his or her hand and
seal and the surety has caused its common seal to be affixed ........[

you must do so within the time limited by any relevant rule of court or

rights against, the estate.

earlier date ordered by the court.
(8) If an authorization to obtain estate information issues to the
applicant, the applicant may apply for a grant without further notice.
If an authorization to obtain resealing information issues to the
applicant, the applicant may apply for the resealing of the foreign
grant without further notice to you.

there is a will, to the beneficiaries or, if there is no will, to
intestate successors of the deceased, an accounting as to how the estate
was administered and how the estate assets were distributed, and if a
foreign grant is resealed as a result of the application, the intended
applicant must provide, if there is a will, to the beneficiaries or, if
there is no will, to intestate successors of the deceased, an accounting
as to how the estate comprising the assets to which the resealed grant
applies was administered and how those assets were distributed.

Appendix B — Party and Party Costs
[am. B.C. Reg. 277/2023, Sch. 1, s. 6.]
Interpretation
1
In this Appendix,
"process"
means the drawing, filing or service of a document and any amendment
to it or particulars of it, but does not include an application made
with respect to the process or any part of the process.
Scale of costs
2
(1)
If a court has made an order for costs, it may fix the scale, from
Scale A to Scale C in subsection (2), under which the costs will be
assessed, and may order that one or more steps in the proceeding be
assessed under a different scale from that fixed for other steps.
(2)
In fixing the scale of costs, the court must have regard to the
following principles:
(a)
Scale A is for matters of little or less than ordinary difficulty;
(b)
Scale B is for matters of ordinary difficulty;
(c)
Scale C is for matters of more than ordinary difficulty.
(3)
In fixing the appropriate scale under which costs will be assessed,
the court may take into account the following:
(a)
whether a difficult issue of law, fact or construction is involved;
(b)
whether an issue is of importance to a class or body of persons, or is
of general interest;
(c)
whether the result of the proceeding effectively determines the rights
and obligations as between the parties beyond the relief that was
actually granted or denied.
(4)
If, after December 31, 2006, a settlement is reached under which
payment of assessed costs is agreed to or an order for costs is made,
and if no scale is fixed or agreed to in that settlement or order, the
costs must be assessed under Scale B, unless a party, on application,
obtains an order of the court that the costs be assessed under another
scale.
(5)
If, after it fixes the scale of costs applicable to a proceeding under
subsection (1) or (4), the court finds that, as a result of unusual
circumstances, an award of costs on that scale would be grossly
inadequate or unjust, the court may order that the value for each unit
allowed for that proceeding, or for any step in that proceeding, be
1.5 times the value that would otherwise apply to a unit in that scale
under section 3 (1).
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (5) of this section, an award of costs
is not grossly inadequate or unjust merely because there is a
difference between the actual legal expenses of a party and the costs
to which that party would be entitled under the scale of costs fixed
under subsection (1) or (4).
(7)
If costs may be assessed without order or agreement, the scale of
costs must be fixed by the registrar on the assessment.
(8)
If an offer to settle is made under Rule 9-1, any costs payable on
acceptance of that offer must be assessed under Scale B.
Value of units
3
(1)
The value for each unit allowed on an assessment conducted after
December 31, 2006 in relation to orders and settlements made after
that date is as follows:
(a)
Scale A — $60;
(b)
Scale B — $110;
(c)
Scale C — $170.
(2)
If maximum and minimum numbers of units are provided for in an Item in
the Tariff, the registrar has the discretion to allow a number within
that range of units.
(3)
If the Tariff indicates a range of units for a Tariff Item, the
registrar must have regard to the following principles:
(a)
one unit is for matters on which little time should ordinarily have
been spent;
(b)
the maximum number of units is for matters on which a great deal of
time should ordinarily have been spent.
Daily rates
4
(1)
If, in a Tariff Item, a number of units is allowed for each day but
the time spent during a day is not more than 2 1/2 hours,
only 1/2 of the number of units is to be allowed for that day.
(2)
If, in a Tariff Item, a number of units is allowed for each day but
the time spent during a day is more than 5 hours, the number of
units allowed for that day is to be increased by 1/2 of the number.
(3)
If, in a Tariff Item, a number of units is allowed for preparation for
an attendance but the time spent on the attendance is not more than
2 1/2 hours, only 1/2 of the number of units for preparation
is to be allowed.
(4)
If, in the Tariff, units may be allowed for preparation for an
activity, the registrar may allow units for preparation for an
activity that does not take place or is adjourned up to the maximum
allowable for one day.
Uncontested foreclosure proceedings
5
In a proceeding under Rule 21-7, uncontested at the hearing on any
issue except costs, the costs must be assessed under Scale A.
Default judgment and process for execution
6
(1)
Schedule 1 applies to the costs that may be assessed on a default
judgment entered under Rule 3-8.
(2)
The amount involved under subsection (1) is the amount for which the
judgment is entered.
(3)
If a writ of execution or garnishing order, or a process in Form 56,
58 or 59, is issued, the costs must be endorsed on the process and
allowed in accordance with Schedule 2, instead of Item 42.
(4)
The amount involved under subsection (3) is the amount payable, if
any, that is endorsed on the process.
(5)
In addition to the fees set out in Schedules 1 and 2, the costs of any
application to the court relating to the judgment or to the process
for execution may be ordered to be assessed under the Tariff.
Apportionment if proceedings tried together
7
If 2 or more proceedings have, by order, been tried at the same time
or tried one after the other and no order has been made as to
apportionment of costs, the registrar may
(a)
assess 2 or more bills as one bill,
(b)
allow an item once or more than once, or
(c)
apportion the costs of an item or of the whole bill between the
proceedings.
Offer to settle bill of costs
8
A party to an assessment may serve on another party an offer to settle
the amount of the bill of costs in Form 123 and, after the assessment
has been completed, may produce the offer to the registrar, and the
registrar must determine whether the offer should have been accepted
and, if so, may disallow items of the Tariff that relate to the
assessment to the party presenting the bill, and
(a)
allow, by way of set-off, items of the Tariff that relate to the
assessment to the party making the offer, or
(b)
allow double the value of items of the Tariff that relate to the
assessment to the party presenting the bill and making the offer.
Transitional — orders, settlements and costs before 2007
9
Appendix B of the Supreme Court Rules, B.C. Reg. 221/90, as it read on
December 31, 2006, applies to
(a)
