Small Claims Rules
[Last amended October 3, 2022 by B.C. Reg. 161/2022]
Introduction
The purpose of these rules is to make it as easy as possible for
people to use the court to resolve their disputes. If necessary, there
will be a trial and a judge or a justice will decide the claim.
However, both sides are encouraged to try to come to an agreement. A
settlement is always possible, even after a judge or a justice has
made a decision.
