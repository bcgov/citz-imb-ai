Other Tsawwassen Lands in accordance with clause 20, Tsawwassen First
Nation may set fees, rents, royalties or charges other than taxes,
related to the exploration, development, extraction or production of

36. Tsawwassen First Nation may add lands that it owns in fee simple to
Tsawwassen Lands, in accordance with clauses 37 through 49, no more

or
b. British Columbia and Tsawwassen First Nation agree.

1998 Roberts Bank Protocol Agreement between Tsawwassen First Nation and

Specified Lands will become Tsawwassen Lands after completion of the
process set out in clauses 43 and 44.
43. Before the addition of any parcel of Specified Lands to Tsawwassen

a. Tsawwassen First Nation owns the land in fee simple;
b. the land is within Tsawwassen Territory; and
c. the land is:
i. outside municipal boundaries and a change in jurisdiction to that

46. In addition to the matters set out in clause 45, British Columbia
will take into account among other factors:
a. whether the land is contiguous to existing Tsawwassen Lands; and

53. If British Columbia no longer requires any portion of the Highway 17

a. at the request of Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen First Nation

the Highway 17 Corridor.
DELTAPORT WAY CORRIDOR
57. British Columbia or Canada, as applicable, will Consult with
Tsawwassen First Nation before authorizing new works within the
Deltaport Way Corridor.
FEDERAL EXPROPRIATION
58. Canada acknowledges the interest of Tsawwassen First Nation in
maintaining the size and integrity of Tsawwassen Lands and agrees that,
as a general principle, federal expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands will
be avoided where reasonably practicable, except as set out in this
chapter.
59. Where the fee simple interest in a parcel of land in the Former
Tsawwassen Reserve is held by Tsawwassen First Nation, a Tsawwassen
Member, a Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution, no
interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal Expropriating
Authority.
60. Despite clause 58, where the fee simple interest in a parcel of
Tsawwassen Lands, including the Former Tsawwassen Reserve, is held by a
Person other than Tsawwassen First Nation, a Tsawwassen Member, a
Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution, this chapter
does not apply to the expropriation of any interest in that parcel and,
for greater certainty, any such interest may be expropriated under
federal legislation.
61. Despite clause 58, but subject to clause 59, where the fee simple
interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is held by Tsawwassen First
Nation, any interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal
Expropriating Authority in accordance with this chapter, federal
legislation, and with the consent of the Governor in Council.
62. Despite clause 58, but subject to clause 59, where the fee simple
interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is held by a Tsawwassen Member,
a Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution, any
interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal Expropriating
Authority in accordance with federal legislation, and with the consent
of the Governor in Council, and in accordance with clauses 63 through
68, clause 76, clause 77, and clauses 79 through 86, which apply with
such modifications as the circumstances require to reflect that the
interest is held by a Tsawwassen Member, a Tsawwassen Corporation or a
Tsawwassen Public Institution, as the case may be, except that any
return of land under clauses 79 through 82 will be to Tsawwassen First
Nation.
63. The Governor in Council may consent to an expropriation of an
interest in Tsawwassen Lands only if the expropriation is justifiable in
accordance with clause 64 and necessary for a public purpose.
64. For the purposes of clause 63, an expropriation is justifiable where
the Governor in Council is satisfied that the following requirements
have been met:
a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative land to acquire
that is not Tsawwassen Lands;
b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Federal Expropriating
Authority to acquire the interest in Tsawwassen Lands through agreement
with Tsawwassen First Nation;
c. the most limited interest in Tsawwassen Lands necessary for the
purpose for which the interest in land is sought is expropriated and for
the shortest time possible; and
d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that
would be protected from disclosure under federal legislation, has been
provided to Tsawwassen First Nation.
65. Before the Governor in Council consents to the expropriation of an
interest in Tsawwassen Lands, the Federal Expropriating Authority will
provide to Tsawwassen First Nation, and make available to the public, a
report stating the justification for the expropriation and describing
the steps taken to satisfy the requirements set out in clause 64.
66. If Tsawwassen First Nation objects to a proposed expropriation of an
interest in Tsawwassen Lands, it may, within 60 days after the report
has been provided to Tsawwassen First Nation in accordance with clause
65, by providing notice in writing to the Federal Expropriating
Authority, refer the matter for review of the steps taken to satisfy the
requirements set out in clause 64 directly to neutral evaluation under
Stage Two of the Dispute Resolution chapter.
67. The Federal Expropriating Authority may not seek Governor in Council
consent to the expropriation of an interest in Tsawwassen Lands before
the expiration of the period referred to in clause 66 or, if Tsawwassen
First Nation has referred the matter to a neutral evaluator in
accordance with clause 66, before the neutral evaluator has reported on
the matter, such report to be rendered to Tsawwassen First Nation and
the Federal Expropriating Authority within 60 days of the referral being
made, or within such additional time period as they may agree.
68. Without limiting the generality of the Dispute Resolution chapter,
the opinion of the neutral evaluator under clause 66:
a. is without prejudice to the legal positions that may be taken by a
Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen First Nation in court or
in any other forum;
b. will not be admissible in any legal proceedings, unless otherwise
required by law; and
c. is not binding on the Governor in Council under clauses 63 and 64.
69. Where a fee simple interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is
expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority, the Federal
Expropriating Authority will make reasonable efforts:
a. to identify replacement land within Tsawwassen Territory, being
either Crown land or land available on a willing-seller willing-buyer
basis, of equivalent or greater size and comparable value; and
b. if the replacement land is acceptable to Tsawwassen First Nation, to
acquire and offer the replacement land to Tsawwassen First Nation as
partial or full compensation for the expropriation.
If the Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen First Nation are
unable to agree on the provision of replacement land as compensation,
the Federal Expropriating Authority will provide Tsawwassen First Nation
with other compensation in accordance with this Agreement.
70. Subject to clause 73, if the replacement land identified by the
Federal Expropriating Authority would result in the total size of
Tsawwassen Lands being less than as at the Effective Date and Tsawwassen
First Nation does not agree that the replacement land is of comparable
value to the interest in Tsawwassen Lands being expropriated, then
Tsawwassen First Nation may refer the issue of whether the replacement
land is of comparable value to the interest in Tsawwassen Lands being
expropriated to be finally determined by arbitration under the Dispute
Resolution chapter.
71. The total value of compensation for an interest in Tsawwassen Lands
expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority under this chapter
will be determined by taking into account the following factors:
a. the market value of the expropriated interest or of the Tsawwassen
Lands in which an interest has been expropriated;
b. the replacement value of any improvement to Tsawwassen Lands in which
an interest has been expropriated;
c. any expenses or losses resulting from a disturbance directly
attributable to the expropriation;
d. any reduction in the value of any interest in Tsawwassen Lands that
is not expropriated which directly relates to the expropriation;
e. any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of
Tsawwassen Lands in which an interest has been expropriated to
Tsawwassen First Nation, provided that the cultural or other special
value is only applied to an interest in Tsawwassen Lands recognized in
law and held by Tsawwassen First Nation, and provided that there will be
no increase in the total value of compensation on account of any Section
35 Rights of Tsawwassen First Nation; and
f. the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or
incidental to the occupation or use of Tsawwassen Lands by Tsawwassen
First Nation to the extent that the value is not otherwise compensated.
72. Subject to clause 73, if the total value of compensation cannot be
agreed upon between the Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen
First Nation, or where there is disagreement on whether the combination
of replacement land and cash is equal to the total value of
compensation, either the Federal Expropriating Authority or Tsawwassen
First Nation may refer the issue of the total value of compensation for
dispute resolution under the Dispute Resolution chapter.
73. A dispute on the valuation of replacement land under clause 70, or
on the total value of compensation under clause 72, or on the terms and
conditions of the return of land under clause 82 will not delay the
expropriation.
74. Any claim or encumbrance in respect of the interest expropriated may
only be claimed against the amount of compensation that is otherwise
payable under clause 71.
75. Interest on compensation is payable from the date the expropriation
takes effect, at the prejudgment interest rate payable in accordance
with federal legislation.
76. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates a fee simple
interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands, that parcel will no longer be
Tsawwassen Lands.
77. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates less than a fee
simple interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands:
a. the parcel retains its status as Tsawwassen Lands;
b. the parcel remains subject to Tsawwassen Laws, except to the extent
that such laws are inconsistent with the use of the parcel of land for
which the expropriation took place; and
c. Tsawwassen First Nation or any interest holder may continue to use
and occupy the parcel, except to the extent that the use or occupation
is inconsistent with the use of the parcel for which the expropriation
took place in the view of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
78. Canada and British Columbia will consent to replacement land,
transferred by a Federal Expropriating Authority to Tsawwassen First
Nation as part of the compensation in accordance with clause 69, being
added to Tsawwassen Lands if:
a. the replacement land is within Tsawwassen Territory;
b. the replacement land is outside municipal boundaries and a change in
jurisdiction to that land will not unreasonably restrict the expansion
or development of a municipality, or the replacement land is inside
municipal boundaries if the municipality consents;
c. the replacement land is free from any overlapping aboriginal claim
unless the claimant consents; and
d. the addition of replacement land to Tsawwassen Lands will not result
in Canada or British Columbia being required to assume financial or
other obligations.
79. Where an expropriated interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is no
longer required for the purpose for which it was expropriated, the
federal department, agency or entity, or its successor or assigns, will
ensure that the interest in land is returned to Tsawwassen First Nation
on the terms and conditions negotiated in accordance with clause 81.
Subject to clause 78, where a fee simple interest in a parcel of land is
returned to Tsawwassen First Nation in accordance with this clause, the
parcel of land will become Tsawwassen Lands on the date of the transfer.
80. The Minister responsible for the federal department, agency or other
entity, or its successors or assigns, who holds the expropriated
interest, without the consent of the Governor in Council, may decide
that the expropriated interest is no longer required and may determine
the disposition of any improvements.
81. The terms and conditions of the return of an expropriated interest
in Tsawwassen Lands, including requirements relating to financial
considerations based on market value principles, the condition of the
land to be returned, and the process for resolving disputes on the
implementation of the terms and conditions, will be negotiated by
Tsawwassen First Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority at the
time of the expropriation.
82. Subject to clause 73, where the terms and conditions of the return
of an expropriated interest in Tsawwassen Lands cannot be agreed upon by
Tsawwassen First Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority at the
time of the expropriation, either Tsawwassen First Nation or the Federal
Expropriating Authority may refer the issue to be finally determined by
arbitration under the Dispute Resolution chapter.
83. Except as otherwise provided in clauses 58 through 86, no conflict
or dispute between the Parties in respect of the interpretation,
application or implementation of these clauses will go to dispute
resolution under the Dispute Resolution chapter.
84. For greater certainty, and subject to clause 85, except to the
extent that the provisions of this chapter modify the application of
federal legislation relating to an expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands,
all federal legislation relating to expropriation applies to an
expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands under this chapter.
85. Without limiting the generality of clause 27 of the General
Provisions chapter, this Agreement prevails to the extent of an
inconsistency with the federal
Expropriation Act
or other federal legislation relating to an expropriation of Tsawwassen
Lands.
86. Nothing in this Agreement affects or limits the application of the
Emergencies Act
(Canada), or any successor legislation, and the
Emergencies Act
(Canada) continues to apply in all aspects to Tsawwassen Lands.
PROVINCIAL EXPROPRIATION
87. British Columbia acknowledges as a general principle that where it
is reasonable to use other means, expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands and
Other Tsawwassen Lands will be avoided.
88. Expropriations of Tsawwassen Lands by Provincial Expropriating
Authorities in total, over time, will not exceed three per cent of the
amount of Tsawwassen Lands as at the Effective Date.
89. For greater certainty, Provincial Law in respect of expropriation
applies to Other Tsawwassen Lands and to additions to Tsawwassen Lands.
90. Subject to this chapter, any expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands by
and for the use of a Provincial Expropriating Authority will be carried
out in accordance with applicable provincial legislation and processes.
91. Where a Provincial Expropriating Authority has determined that it
must use Tsawwassen Lands:
a. it will make reasonable efforts to acquire the land through agreement
with Tsawwassen First Nation and any interest holder; and
b. it will provide to Tsawwassen First Nation and any interest holder
information relevant to the acquisition or expropriation.
92. Any expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands by a Provincial Expropriating
Authority will be:
a. of the smallest estate or interest necessary, and for the shortest
time required;
b. by and for the use of a provincial ministry or agent of the
provincial Crown, or for the use of a Public Utility whether or not an
agent of the Crown, who would otherwise have the authority to
expropriate land under provincial legislation, or on whose behalf
British Columbia may expropriate;
c. necessary for a public purpose; and
d. with the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.
93. The total value of the compensation provided by the Provincial
Expropriating Authority will take into account among other factors:
a. the market value of the estate or interest expropriated plus
reasonable damages for disturbance including moving, legal and survey
costs;
b. the value of the goodwill of a business located on the expropriated
property if the business cannot be relocated;
c. if not included in the market value, the value of a special economic
advantage to the owner arising out of the owner's occupation of the land
and the value of improvements made by an owner occupying a residence on
the land; and
d. if the expropriated property has a limited market because of its use,
compensation may be based on the reasonable costs of rebuilding on
another site.
94. Where a fee simple estate or less than a fee simple estate in a
parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is expropriated by a Provincial Expropriating
Authority:
a. the parcel retains its status as Tsawwassen Lands;
b. the parcel remains subject to Tsawwassen Law except to the extent
that the Tsawwassen Law is inconsistent with the use of the parcel of
land for which the expropriation took place; and
c. Tsawwassen First Nation or any interest holder may continue to use
and occupy the parcel, except to the extent that such use or occupation
is inconsistent with the use of the parcel of land for which the
expropriation took place.
95. Where an expropriated interest in Tsawwassen Lands is no longer
required by a Provincial Expropriating Authority, the interest will be
returned to Tsawwassen First Nation subject to terms to be negotiated at
the time of the return.
MINES AND MINERALS UNDER ENGLISH BLUFF
96. The mines and minerals set out in Appendix C-5 are not included in
Tsawwassen Lands, and Canada will transfer those mines and minerals to
British Columbia on the Effective Date.
97. Tsawwassen First Nation releases to Canada all of the rights and
interests that Tsawwassen First Nation or Tsawwassen Members ever had,
now have or may have in the future in the mines and minerals referred to
in clause 96, and acknowledges that, on the Effective Date, those mines
and minerals are no longer set apart for the use and benefit of
Tsawwassen First Nation.
98. In consideration of the arrangement described in clause 96 and the
release set out in clause 97, Canada will pay to Tsawwassen First Nation
the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000) on the Effective Date, the
sufficiency of which Tsawwassen First Nation hereby acknowledges.
ACCRETED LANDS
99. For greater certainty, the water boundary fronting Tsawwassen Lands
is the Natural Boundary.
100. Tsawwassen First Nation owns any lawful accretions to Tsawwassen
Lands.
101. Where Tsawwassen First Nation provides to Canada and British
Columbia notice confirming that there has been lawful accretion within
the meaning of the
Land Title Act
to Tsawwassen Lands, then within 150 days the Parties will amend
Appendix C-4 in accordance with clause 11 of the Amendment chapter to
reflect the change to the boundaries of Tsawwassen Lands and, if
required, the Lieutenant Governor in Council will issue supplementary
letters patent to reflect the change, if any, to the area of the
Corporation of Delta.
LEGAL SURVEY
102. Canada and British Columbia will, as agreed between them, pay the
cost of initially surveying the boundaries of Tsawwassen Lands, and
Other Tsawwassen Lands set out in Appendix E-2.
103. In those cases where adequate surveys do not already exist, before
the Effective Date, or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date,
Canada and British Columbia will register new survey plans in the Land
Title Office and upon registration of those new survey plans, the
Parties will amend Appendix C-4 in accordance with clause 11 of the
Amendment chapter to change the boundaries of Tsawwassen Lands.
CONTAMINATED SITES
104. The transfer of the Former Tsawwassen Reserve to Tsawwassen First
Nation in accordance with this Agreement does not, in and of itself,
result in British Columbia being liable in respect of any Contamination
of such lands.
105. In respect of provincial Crown lands transferred to Tsawwassen
First Nation in accordance with this Agreement, to the best of British
Columbia's knowledge those lands have not been used for a prescribed
industrial or commercial purpose or any other purpose or activity
prescribed under the
Environmental Management Act
, and British Columbia is not required to prepare or provide a Site
Profile for those lands.
106. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
recovering the costs incurred in the inspection or remediation of any
Contaminated Sites on the lands referred to in clause 105 from British
Columbia or any other Person who may be determined to be a Responsible
Person in respect of the Contamination of that site.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL FUND
107. On the Effective Date, Canada will provide to Tsawwassen First
Nation an amount, to be paid in accordance with clause 1 of the Capital
Transfer and Negotiation Loan Repayment chapter, for the purpose of
establishing an Economic Development Capital Fund. The value in 2006 of
that amount is approximately $1,055,000.
