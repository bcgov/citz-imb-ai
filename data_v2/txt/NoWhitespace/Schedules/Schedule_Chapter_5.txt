and any other interests subordinate to those interests will be
registered, or will remain registered, in the Land Title Office in
accordance with the requirements of the
Land Title Act
.
2. On registration of the indefeasible title to a parcel of Tsawwassen

provisos, restrictions, exceptions and reservations, in favour of
Tsawwassen First Nation.
3. Registration, in accordance with clause 1, including the provision of
a State of Title Certificate, will be at no cost to Tsawwassen First
Nation or the holder of an interest referred to in clause 1, except for
a Public Utility, other than Tsawwassen First Nation, with an interest
referred to in Appendix D-3.
4. No title adverse to, or in derogation of, the title of the registered
owner of a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands under the
Land Title Act
will be acquired by length of possession and, for greater certainty,
subsection 23 (4) of the
Land Title Act
does not apply in respect of Tsawwassen Lands.
CANCELLATION OF INDEFEASIBLE TITLE
5. Only Tsawwassen First Nation, in accordance with this chapter, may
apply under the
Land Title Act
for cancellation of the registration of an indefeasible title to a
parcel of Tsawwassen Lands.
6. When applying under the
Land Title Act
, in accordance with this chapter, for the cancellation of the
registration of an indefeasible title to a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands,
Tsawwassen First Nation will provide to the Registrar an application for
cancellation of the registration and any duplicate indefeasible title
that may have been issued in respect of that parcel.
7. Upon receiving an application from Tsawwassen First Nation for
cancellation of the registration of an indefeasible title to a parcel of
Tsawwassen Lands under clauses 5 and 6, and if:
a. the registered owner of the estate in fee simple to the parcel is
Tsawwassen First Nation, a Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public
Institution;
b. the registered owner consents; and
c. the indefeasible title to the parcel is free and clear of all
charges, except those in favour of Tsawwassen First Nation,
the Registrar will cancel the registration of the indefeasible title.

Land Title Act
will not apply to a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands for which the
indefeasible title under the
Land Title Act
has been cancelled under that Act in accordance with this Agreement.
AMENDMENT TO THE LAND TITLE ACT
9. Provincial Settlement Legislation will amend the
Land Title Act
:
a. to give effect to this Agreement;
b. to require that a Certificate of Transfer issued in accordance with
Tsawwassen Law be submitted to the Registrar before the transfer of a
fee simple interest may be registered in respect of Tsawwassen Lands;
and
c. so that, under that Act, the position of the Tsawwassen First Nation
and the Tsawwassen Government in relation to Tsawwassen Lands is
analogous, as may be applicable, to:
i. the Crown and the provincial government in relation to Crown land, or
ii. a municipality and its council, a regional district and its board or
an improvement district and its board of trustees, in relation to lands
in a municipality, regional district or improvement district.
10. The Registrar is entitled to rely on, and is not required to make
any inquiries in respect of, the matters certified in the Certificate of
Transfer.
