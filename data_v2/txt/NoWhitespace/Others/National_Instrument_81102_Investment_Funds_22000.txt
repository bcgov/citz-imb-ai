176/2014, Sch. C, s. 86.]
Changes affecting performance data
15.9
(1)
If, during or after a performance measurement period of performance
data contained in a sales communication, there have been changes in
the business, operations or affairs of the investment fund or asset
allocation service to which the sales communication pertains that
could have materially affected the performance of the investment fund
or asset allocation service, the sales communication must contain
(a)
summary disclosure of the changes, and of how those changes could have
affected the performance had those changes been in effect throughout
the performance measurement period; and
(b)
for a money market fund that during the performance measurement period
did not pay or accrue the full amount of any fees and charges of the
type described under paragraph 15.11 (1) 1, disclosure of the
difference between the full amounts and the amounts actually charged,
expressed as an annualized percentage on a basis comparable to current
yield.
(2)
If an investment fund has, in the last 10 years, undertaken a
reorganization with, or acquired assets from, another investment fund
in a transaction that was a material change for the investment fund or
would have been a material change for the investment fund had this
Instrument been in force at the time of the transaction, then, in any
sales communication of the investment fund,
(a)
the investment fund must provide summary disclosure of the
transaction;
(b)
the investment fund may include its performance data covering any part
of a period before the transaction only if it also includes the
performance data for the other fund for the same periods;
(c)
the investment fund must not include its performance data for any part
of a period after the transaction unless
(i)
12 months have passed since the transaction, or
(ii)
the investment fund includes in the sales communication the
performance data for itself and the other investment fund referred to
in paragraph (b); and
(d)
the investment fund must not include any performance data for any
period that is composed of both time before and after the transaction.
[am. B.C. Regs. 218/2005, App. C, s. 9; 176/2014, Sch. C, s. 87.]
Formula for calculating standard performance data
15.10
(1)
The standard performance data of an investment fund must be calculated
in accordance with this Part.
(2)
In this Part:
"current yield"
means the yield of a money market fund expressed as a percentage and
determined by applying the following formula:
current yield =
seven day return ×
365
7
× 100
"effective yield"
means the yield of a money market fund expressed as a percentage and
determined by applying the following formula:
effective yield =
(seven day return + 1)
365
7
− 1
× 100
"seven day return"
means the income yield of an account of a securityholder in a money
market fund that is calculated by
(a)
determining the net change, exclusive of new subscriptions other than
from the reinvestment of distributions or proceeds of redemption of
securities of the money market fund, in the value of the account,
(b)
subtracting all fees and charges of the type referred to in
paragraph 15.11 (1) 3 for the seven day period, and
(c)
dividing the result by the value of the account at the beginning of
the seven day period;
"standard performance data"
means, as calculated in each case in accordance with this Part,
(a)
for a money market fund, either of the following:
(i)
the current yield;
(ii)
the current yield and effective yield, if the effective yield is
reported in a type size that is at least equal to that of the current
yield, and
(b)
for any investment fund other than a money market fund, the total
return;
"total return"
means the annual compounded rate of return for an investment fund for
a period that would equate the initial value to the redeemable value
at the end of the period, expressed as a percentage, and determined by
applying the following formula:
total return =
redeemable value
initial value
I
N
− 1
× 100
where
N = the length of the performance measurement period in years, with a
minimum value of 1.
(3)
If there are fees and charges of the type described in
paragraph 15.11 (1) 1 relevant to the calculation of
redeemable value and initial value of the securities of an investment
fund, the redeemable value and initial value of securities of an
investment fund must be the net asset value of one unit or share of
the investment fund at the beginning or at the end of the performance
measurement period, minus the amount of those fees and charges
calculated by applying the assumptions referred to in that paragraph
to a hypothetical securityholder account.
(4)
If there are no fees and charges of the type described in
paragraph 15.11 (1) 1 relevant to a calculation of
total return, the calculation of total return for an investment fund
may assume a hypothetical investment of one security of the investment
fund and be calculated as follows:
(a)
"initial value"
means the net asset value of one unit or share of an investment fund
at the beginning of the performance measurement period; and
(b)
"redeemable value"

where

at the end of the performance measurement period,
D

fund at the time of each distribution,
P
= the dividend or distribution reinvestment price per security of the
investment fund at the time of each distribution, and
n
= the number of dividends or distributions during the performance
measurement period.
(5)
Standard performance data of an asset allocation service must be based
upon the standard performance data of its participating funds.
(6)
Performance data
(a)
for an investment fund other than a money market fund must be
calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one percent; and
(b)
for a money market fund must be calculated to the nearest
one-hundredth of one percent.
[am. B.C. Reg. 176/2014, Sch. C, s. 88.]
Assumptions for calculating standard performance data
15.11
(1)
The following assumptions must be made in the calculation of standard
performance data of an investment fund:
1. Recurring fees and charges that are payable by all securityholders
(a) are accrued or paid in proportion to the length of the performance
measurement period;
(b) if structured in a manner that would result in the performance
information being dependent on the size of an investment, are
calculated on the basis of an investment equal to the greater of
$10 000 or the minimum amount that may be invested; and
(c) if fully negotiable, are calculated on the basis of the average
fees paid by accounts of the size referred to in paragraph (b).
2. There are no fees and charges related to specific optional
services.
3. All fees and charges payable by the investment fund are accrued or
paid.
4. Dividends or distributions by the investment fund are reinvested in
the investment fund at the net asset value per security of the
investment fund on the reinvestment dates during the performance
measurement period.
5. There are no non-recurring fees and charges that are payable by
some or all securityholders and no recurring fees and charges that are
payable by some but not all securityholders.
6. In the case of a mutual fund, a complete redemption occurs at the
end of the performance measurement period so that the ending
redeemable value includes elements of return that have been accrued
but not yet paid to securityholders.
7. In the case of a non-redeemable investment fund, a complete
redemption occurs at the net asset value of one security at the end of
the performance measurement period so that the ending redeemable value
includes elements of return that have been accrued but not yet paid to
securityholders.
(2)
The following assumptions must be made in the calculation of standard
performance data of an asset allocation service:
1. Fees and charges that are payable by participants in the asset
allocation service
(a) are accrued or paid in proportion to the length of the performance
measurement period;
(b) if structured in a manner that would result in the performance
information being dependent on the size of an investment, are
calculated on the basis of an investment equal to the greater of
$10 000 or the minimum amount that may be invested; and
(c) if fully negotiable, are calculated on the basis of the average
fees paid by accounts of the size referred to in paragraph (b).
2. There are no fees and charges related to specific optional
services.
3. The investment strategy recommended by the asset allocation service
is utilized for the performance measurement period.
4. Transfer fees are
(a) accrued or paid;
(b) if structured in a manner that would result in the performance
information being dependent on the size of an investment, calculated
on the basis of an account equal to the greater of $10 000 or the
minimum amount that may be invested; and
(c) if the fees and charges are fully negotiable, calculated on the
basis of the average fees paid by an account of the size referred to
in paragraph (b).
5. A complete redemption occurs at the end of the performance
measurement period so that the ending redeemable value includes
elements of return that have been accrued but not yet paid to
securityholders.
(3)
The calculation of standard performance data must be based on actual
historical performance and the fees and charges payable by the
investment fund and securityholders, or the asset allocation service
and participants, in effect during the performance measurement period.
[am. B.C. Reg. 176/2014, Sch. C, s. 89.]
Sales communications during the waiting period
15.12
If a sales communication is used after the issue of a receipt for a
preliminary prospectus of the mutual fund described in the sales

the sales communication must state only
(a)
whether the security represents a share in a corporation or an
interest in a non-corporate entity;
(b)

(e)
any additional information permitted by securities legislation.

Securities issued by an unincorporated investment fund must be
described by a term that is not and does not include the word
"shares".
(2)
A communication by an investment fund or asset allocation service, its
promoter, manager, portfolio adviser, principal distributor,
participating dealer or a person providing services to the investment
fund or asset allocation service must not describe the investment fund
as an alternative mutual fund or as a vehicle for investors to
participate in the speculative trading of, or leveraged investment in,
derivatives, unless the investment fund is an alternative mutual fund.
[am. B.C. Regs. 176/2014, Sch. C, s. 91; 287/2018, Sch. C, s. 32.]
Sales communication — multi-class investment funds
15.14
A sales communication for an investment fund that distributes
different classes or series of securities that are referable to the
same portfolio must not contain performance data unless the sales
communication complies with the following requirements:
1. The sales communication clearly specifies the class or series of
security to which any performance data contained in the sales
communication relates.
2. If the sales communication refers to more than one class or series
of security and provides performance data for any one class or series,
the sales communication must provide performance data for each class
or series of security referred to in the sales communication and must
clearly explain the reasons for different performance data among the
classes or series.
3. A sales communication for a new class or series of security and an
existing class or series of security must not contain performance data
for the existing class or series unless the sales communication
clearly explains any differences between the new class or series and
the existing class or series that could affect performance.

Investment Risk Classification Methodology
Item 1 — Investment risk level
(1) Subject to subsection (2), to determine the investment risk level of
a mutual fund,
(a) determine the mutual fund's standard deviation in accordance with
Item 2 and, as applicable, Item 3, 4 or 5,
(b) in the following table, locate the range of standard deviation
within which the mutual fund's standard deviation falls, and
(c) identify the investment risk level set opposite the applicable
range:
Standard Deviation Range
Investment Risk Level
0 to less than 6
Low
6 to less than 11
Low to medium
11 to less than 16
Medium
16 to less than 20
Medium to high
20 or greater
High
(2) Despite subsection (1), the investment risk level of a mutual fund
may be increased if doing so is reasonable in the circumstances.
(3) A mutual fund must keep and maintain records that document:
(a) how the investment risk level of the mutual fund was determined, and
(b) if the investment risk level of the mutual fund was increased, why
it was reasonable to do so in the circumstances.
Item 2 — Standard deviation
(1) A mutual fund must calculate its standard deviation for the most
recent 10 years as follows:
where
n
=
120 months
R
i
=
return on investment in month
i
R
̅̅
=
average monthly return on investment
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a mutual fund must make the
calculation with respect to the series or class of securities of the
mutual fund that first became available to the public and calculate the
"return on investment" for each month using
(a) the net asset value of the mutual fund, assuming the reinvestment of
all income and capital gain distributions in additional securities of
the mutual fund, and
(b) the same currency in which the series or class is offered.
Item 3 — Difference in classes or series of securities of a mutual
fund
Despite Item 2 (2), if a series or class of securities of the mutual
fund has an attribute that results in a different investment risk level
for the series or class than the investment risk level of the mutual
fund, the return on investment for that series or class of securities
must be used to calculate the standard deviation of that series or class
of securities.
Item 4 — Mutual funds with less than 10 years of history
(1) For the purposes of Item 2, if it has been less than 10 years since
securities of the mutual fund were first available to the public, and if
the mutual fund is a clone fund and the underlying fund has 10 years of
performance history, or if there is another mutual fund with 10 years of
performance history that is subject to this Instrument, and has the same
fund manager, portfolio manager, investment objectives and investment
strategies as the mutual fund, then in either case the mutual fund must
calculate the standard deviation of the mutual fund in accordance with
Item 2 by
(a) using the available return history of the mutual fund, and
(b) imputing the return history of the underlying fund or the other
mutual fund, as the case may be, for the remainder of the 10 year
period.
(2) For the purposes of Item 2, if it has been less than 10 years since
securities of the mutual fund were first available to the public, and
subsection (1) does not apply, the mutual fund must select a reference
index in accordance with Item 5 and calculate the standard deviation of
the mutual fund in accordance with Item 2 by
(a) using the return history of the mutual fund, and
(b) imputing the return history of the reference index for the remainder
of the 10 year period.
Item 5 — Reference index
(1) For the purposes of Item 4 (2), the mutual fund must select a
reference index that reasonably approximates or, for a newly established
mutual fund, is expected to reasonably approximate, the standard
deviation of the mutual fund.
(2) When using a reference index, a mutual fund must
(a) monitor the reasonableness of the reference index on an annual basis
or more frequently if necessary, and
(b) disclose in the mutual fund's prospectus in Part B, Item 9.1 of Form
81-101F1 of National Instrument 81-101
Mutual Fund Prospectus Disclosure
or Part B, Item 12.2 of Form 41-101F2 of National Instrument 41-101
General Prospectus Requirements
, as applicable,
(i) a brief description of the reference index, and
(ii) if the reference index has changed since the last disclosure under
this item, details of when and why the change was made.
Instructions:
(1) A reference index must be made up of one permitted index or, where
necessary to more reasonably approximate the standard deviation of a
mutual fund, a composite of several permitted indices.
(2) In selecting and monitoring the reasonableness of a reference
index, a mutual fund must consider a number of factors, including
whether the reference index
(a) contains a high proportion of the securities represented, or
expected to be represented, in the mutual fund's portfolio,
(b) has returns, or is expected to have returns, highly correlated to
the returns of the mutual fund,
(c) has risk and return characteristics that are, or are expected to
be, similar to the mutual fund,
(d) has its returns computed (total return, net of withholding taxes,
etc.) on the same basis as the mutual fund's returns,
(e) is consistent with the investment objectives and investment
strategies in which the mutual fund is investing,
(f) has investable constituents and has security allocations that
represent investable position sizes for the mutual fund, and
(g) is denominated in, or converted into, the same currency as the
mutual fund's reported net asset value.
(3) In addition to the factors listed in Instruction (2), the mutual
fund may consider other factors, if relevant to the specific
characteristics of the mutual fund.
Item 6 — Fundamental changes
(1) For the purposes of Item 2, if there has been a reorganization or
transfer of assets of the mutual fund pursuant to paragraph 5.1 (1) (f)
or (g) or subparagraph 5.1 (1) (h) (i) of the Instrument, the standard
deviation must be calculated using the monthly "return on investment" of
the continuing mutual fund.
(2) Despite subsection (1), if there has been a change to the
fundamental investment objectives of the mutual fund pursuant to
paragraph 5.1 (1) (c) of the Instrument, for the purposes of Item 2, the
standard deviation must be calculated using the monthly return on
investment of the mutual fund starting from the date of that change.
