(b)
the other of which means, the method of operation of which shall be
clearly indicated to the driver of the truck or truck tractor, shall
be of such manufacture and design and so installed and maintained that
such means may be controlled manually by the driver of the truck or

driver's seat of the bus or in an air line leading to the front wheels
of the bus, the air supply to each line can or will be shut off
manually or automatically, and

in such event, the driver is able to apply from the driver's seat the
brakes on the rear wheels of the bus.
Reduction of brake effort on front wheel permitted
6.09
(1)
Notwithstanding these regulations, means may be used for reducing the
braking force applied to the front wheels of a bus, truck or truck
tractor as compared to the braking force applied to the other wheels
of the vehicle.
(2)
No person shall use or operate, or cause to be used or operated, any
means for reducing the braking force applied to the front wheels of a
vehicle as compared to the braking force applied to the other wheels

operation essential to safety.
Single valve to operate all brakes
6.10
(1)
Subject to section 6.07 (3), every bus, truck, truck tractor,

notwithstanding, be effective to stop the travel of the vehicle in
accordance with these regulations.
(2)
The reservoir with which any vehicle is equipped under subsection (1)
shall be equipped with a check valve or a similar device effective to
prevent leakage back to the source, thereby affecting or reducing the
