Calculation of proportionate share in relation to pensions, benefits
under benefit formula provision, disability benefits and phased
retirement benefits
17
(1)

(a)
payments under a pension that has commenced or the commuted value of
those payments;
(b)
benefits under a benefit formula provision before pension commencement
or the commuted value of those benefits;
(c)
disability benefits under a plan;
(d)
annuity payments;
(e)
phased retirement benefits;
this section applies to that calculation.
(2)
The formula set out in subsection (3) applies to the calculation
referred to in subsection (1) unless a section 127 agreement, a
Part 6 order or an original agreement or order referred to in section
25 (1) of this regulation
(a)
supplants that formula, in which case the formula provided for in the
agreement or order applies to the calculation, or
(b)
modifies that formula, in which case the formula as modified by the
agreement or order applies to the calculation.
(3)
Subject to sections 18 and 19, the proportionate share referred to in
subsection (1) of this section must be calculated in accordance
with the following formula:
proportionate share = 1/2 (pensionable service during
entitlement period ÷ total pensionable service)
where
"pensionable service during entitlement period"
means the pensionable service accumulated under the plan by the member
in the entitlement period;
"total pensionable service"
means the pensionable service accumulated by the member to the
earliest of
(a)
the date that the limited member's share is transferred from the plan,
(b)
the beginning of the month in which the limited member begins to
receive a separate pension,
(c)
the beginning of the month in which the limited member begins to
receive a payment of benefits from the member or the administrator,
and
(d)
the day immediately preceding the day of the member's death.
[am. B.C. Reg. 70/2015, s. 5.]

18
For the purposes of accounting in section 17 for purchased service and
transferred service,
"pensionable service during entitlement period"

includes
(i)
all pensionable service, regardless of the period to which it is
allocated, that was purchased by or on behalf of the member during the
entitlement period, and
(ii)
all pensionable service, regardless of the period to which it is
allocated, that was accumulated under another plan during the
entitlement period and transferred to the member's plan, and
(b)
does not include pensionable service purchased by or on behalf of the
member, or accumulated under another plan, before or after the
entitlement period.
Phased retirement period and recalculation of proportionate share
19
If the member accumulates additional pensionable service after the
calculation of the limited member's proportionate share of a phased
retirement benefit under section 115 (5) of the Act or the calculation
of the spouse's proportionate share of benefits payable under section
117 (2) of the Act, the proportionate share must, whenever any of the
following occurs, be recalculated to take into account the additional
pensionable service accumulated by the member:
(a)
the spouse is to receive
(i)
a proportionate share of the commuted value of the benefits under
section 115 (2) (b) of the Act,
(ii)
a separate pension, or
(iii)
a share of benefits under section 124 (2) of the Act on the death of
the member;
(b)

payment of the member's pension resumes.
[am. B.C. Reg. 70/2015, s. 6.]
Calculation of proportionate share in relation to benefits under
defined contribution provision
20
(1)
If it is necessary, under the Act, including under this regulation, to
calculate a proportionate share of the member's defined contribution
account, this section applies to that calculation.
(2)
The formula set out in subsection (3) applies to the calculation
referred to in subsection (1) unless a section 127 agreement, a
Part 6 order or an original agreement or order referred to in section
25 (1) of this regulation
(a)
supplants that formula, in which case the formula provided for in the
agreement or order applies to the calculation, or
(b)
modifies that formula, in which case the formula as modified by the
agreement or order applies to the calculation.
(3)
The proportionate share referred to in subsection (1) must be
calculated in accordance with the following formula:
transfer amount = 1/2 (account balance −
pre-relationship contributions)
where
"account balance"
means the total of
(a)
the defined contribution account, before division, as at the
entitlement date, and
(b)
the investment returns earned on the amount referred to in paragraph
(a) after the entitlement date up to and including the date on which
the spouse's proportionate share of the defined contribution account
is transferred from the plan to the credit of the spouse or used to
establish a defined contribution account in the plan for the spouse;
"pre-relationship contributions"
means the total of
(a)
the defined contribution account as at the commencement date, and
(b)
the investment returns earned on the amount referred to in paragraph
(a) after the commencement date up to and including the date on which
the spouse's proportionate share of the defined contribution account
is transferred from the plan to the credit of the spouse or used to
establish a defined contribution account in the plan for the spouse.
Adjustment of member's benefits under benefit formula provision
21
(1)
This section applies if the member's benefits under a benefit formula
provision are divided under Part 6 of the Act.
(2)
The administrator must, in accordance with subsection (3), adjust the
benefits to which the member is entitled and the basis on which they
are calculated if
(a)
the division referred to in subsection (1) occurs before the member's
pension commences, and
(b)
the limited member or the limited member's estate has received
(i)
the limited member's proportionate share of the benefits by a separate
pension, or
(ii)
a transfer of the limited member's proportionate share of the commuted
value of the benefits.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), if the member's benefits have
vested, the member's pensionable service must be reduced by the amount
of pensionable service reflected in the limited member's proportionate
share of the benefits.
(4)
As an example of the application of subsection (3), if the
proportionate share of the benefits to which a limited member is
entitled is calculated under section 17 and the member's benefits
have vested, the member's pensionable service is to be reduced by
one-half of the pensionable service that, in section 17, constitutes
the "pensionable service during entitlement period".
(5)
A reduction of pensionable service under subsection (3) of this
section
(a)
is only for the purpose of adjusting
(i)
the portion of the benefits that the member is entitled to receive
after the division referred to in subsection (1), or
(ii)
if the member is deceased, the amount of survivor benefits, if any,
and
(b)
is not to be taken into account in any determination of eligibility
for those benefits under the plan.
[am. B.C. Reg. 70/2015, s. 7.]
Adjustment of member's benefits if divided on death of member
22
In a situation referred to in section 124 (2) of the Act,
(a)
the member's benefits must be adjusted, to reflect that division, in
accordance with section 21 of this regulation, and
(b)
any survivor benefits payable under the plan must be calculated on the
adjusted amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.
Calculation of commuted value
23
(1)
In this section,
"valuation date"
, in relation to a matter referred to in subsection (3) (a), (b), (c),
(d) or (e), means the date that, under subsection (3), applies to that
matter.
(2)
This section applies if
(a)
the limited member is entitled under Part 6 of the Act to a
proportionate share of the benefits under a benefit formula provision,
and
(b)
it is necessary, under the Act, including under this regulation, to

(4)
Subject to subsection (5) of this section, the limited member's
proportionate share of the commuted value of benefits must be
calculated as follows:
(a)
the commuted value of the pension the member would have received must
be calculated as if
(i)
there had been no division under the Act,
(ii)
the member's pension had been calculated by reference only to the
benefits accrued to the valuation date, and
(iii)
the member had elected a pension in the unadjusted normal form,
applicable to the member, provided under the plan commencing at the
later of
(A)
the valuation date, and
(B)
the date the member would reach the average retirement age for the
plan;
(b)
after that, the limited member's proportionate share of the amount
referred to in paragraph (a) must be calculated.
(5)
For the purposes of subsection (4) (a) (iii) (B), the administrator
may elect, as the average retirement age for the plan, a specific age
that is younger than the actual average retirement age for the plan,
and if that election is made, the administrator must not change the
average retirement age for the plan without first applying for and
obtaining the written consent of the superintendent.

will increase in value, whether by an automatic formula or on an ad
hoc basis, after the date of the calculation of the compensation
payment or transfer;
