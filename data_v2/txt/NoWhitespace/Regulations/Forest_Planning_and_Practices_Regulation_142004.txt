is consistent with maintaining or enhancing an economically valuable
supply of commercial timber from British Columbia's forests, and
(ii)
is consistent with the timber supply analysis and forest management
assumptions that apply to the area covered by the plan on the date

If an agreement holder rehabilitates an area under subsection (4) or
(5) and erosion of exposed soil from the area would cause sediment to
enter a stream, wetland or lake, or a material adverse effect in
relation to one or more of the subjects listed in section 149 (1) of
the Act, the agreement holder, unless placing debris or revegetation
would not materially reduce the likelihood of erosion, must
(a)
place woody debris on the exposed soils, or

structures described in subsection (1) for either of the reasons set
out in that subsection, the holder must ensure that the limit is
exceeded as little as practicable.

access structures in accordance with the results or strategies
specified in the forest stewardship plan or by

removing or redistributing woody materials that are exposed on the
surface of the area and are concentrating subsurface moisture, as
necessary to limit the concentration of subsurface moisture on the
area,
(b)
de-compacting compacted soils, and
(c)
returning displaced surface soils, retrievable side-cast and berm
materials.
(4)
If an agreement holder rehabilitates an area under subsection (3) (a)
and erosion of exposed soil from the area would cause sediment to
enter a stream, wetland or lake, or a material adverse effect in
relation to one or more of the subjects listed in section 149 (1) of
the Act, the agreement holder, unless placing debris or revegetation
would not materially reduce the likelihood of erosion, must

Secondary structure retention in mountain pine beetle affected stands
43.1
(1)
A holder of a cutting permit, a forestry licence to cut that does not

it is necessary to fell or modify a tree that is a safety hazard and
there is no other practicable option for addressing the safety hazard,
(b)
the harvesting is necessary to construct a road in the targeted pine
leading stand and there is no other practicable option for locating
the road, or
(c)
at the conclusion of timber harvesting, the holder retains an adequate
stocking density of suitable secondary structure.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), a holder of a cutting permit, a forestry
licence to cut that does not provide for cutting permits or a timber

harvesting the timber is necessary to facilitate collection of tree
seed and the resulting opening does not exceed 1 ha.
(3)
Without limiting the stocking standards applicable under section 29
(1) or (2) of the Act or section 46 of this regulation, if a person
referred to in subsection (1) (c) carries out harvesting in a targeted
pine leading stand that creates an obligation to establish a free
growing stand, each tree of suitable secondary structure retained in
the stand is considered to be a tree of a preferred species for the
purpose of establishing a free growing stand on the area where the
adequate stocking density of suitable secondary structure was
retained.
(4)
This section does not apply to
(a)
an occupant licence to cut or a master licence to cut that provides
for cutting permits,
(b)
a forestry licence to cut entered into by a timber sales manager,

a community forest agreement,
(e)
an area that is subject to
(i)
a cutting permit that has been issued,
(ii)
a timber sale licence that has been advertised or entered into, or
(iii)
a forestry licence to cut that does not provide for cutting permits
which has been entered into by the regional manager or district
manager,
before this section comes into force,
(f)
an area that is subject to a cutting permit, a forestry licence to cut
that does not provide for cutting permits or a timber sale licence if
the timber cruising or field layout for the cutting permit, forestry
licence to cut or timber sale licence has been completed before this
section comes into force,
(g)
a cutblock, if the cutblock has been specified in a forest stewardship
plan as an area to which section 196 (1) (a) of the Act applies, or
(h)
an area depicted on a government-endorsed forest cover map which
indicates that lodgepole pine is the leading tree species if a timber
cruise of the timber on the area, or other process agreed to by the
minister prior to harvesting, shows that lodgepole pine is not the
leading tree species.
[en. B.C. Reg. 182/2008, s. 4.]

(b)
as an area which may not contain a targeted pine leading stand for the
purposes of paragraph (c) (ii) of the definition of "targeted pine
leading stand",
if satisfied that the designation is appropriate having regard to the
allowable annual cut determination for the area.
(2)
An order made under subsection (1) (a)
(a)
must be contained in the allowable annual cut determination for the
area that
(i)
is most recent, and

manager,
before the order takes effect under subsection (2) (b), or
(b)
an area within the designated area that is subject to a cutting
permit, a forestry licence to cut that does not provide for cutting
permits or a timber sale licence if the timber cruising or field
layout for the cutting permit, forestry licence to cut or timber sale

[unauthorized timber harvesting]
of the Act, the holder must establish, on the area on which the
contravention occurred, a stand that meets the requirements specified
in the holder's forest stewardship plan for an area with similar
attributes, as if the area on which the contravention occurred had
been identified under section 16 (1) as being subject to this section.
(3)
A person is exempt from the requirements of section 29 (1) and (2)
[free growing stands]
of the Act in respect of an area if timber harvesting is restricted to
