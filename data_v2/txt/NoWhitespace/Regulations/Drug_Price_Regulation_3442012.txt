4
(1)
This section applies to LCA categories established on or after
April 1, 2013.
(2)
Except as set out in subsections (3) and (4), the maximum accepted
list price for drugs in an LCA category that meets both of the
following criteria is 25% of the manufacturer's list price for the LCA
drug comparator for the LCA category, as of the date on which a
generic drug is first included in or excluded from the category after
April 1, 2019:
(a)
the LCA category consists of drugs available as oral solids only;
(b)
the LCA category was established
(i)
on or after April 1, 2019, or
(ii)
before April 1, 2019, but has a generic drug inclusion or exclusion on
or after April 1, 2019.
(2.1)
Except as set out in subsections (3) and (4), the maximum accepted
list price for drugs in an LCA category is the following percentage of
the manufacturer's list price for the LCA drug comparator for that LCA
category, as of the date on which a generic drug is first assigned to
that LCA category:
(a)
20%, if the LCA category consists of drugs available as oral solids
only but subsection (2) does not apply;
(b)
35%, in any other case.
(3)
If the manufacturer's list price of an LCA drug comparator decreased
by more than 20% within 2 years before a generic drug is first
assigned to the LCA category, the date for the purposes of subsection
(2) is the date that is 2 years before a generic drug is first
assigned to that LCA category.
(4)
If section 3 (2) (c)
[LCA program]
applies, the maximum accepted list price for drugs in the LCA category
having no brand drugs is proportional, depending on their strength, to
the maximum accepted list price that applies to the LCA category to
which the designated LCA drug comparator belongs.

that LCA category in any other case.
(3)
If a drug in an LCA category had, as of July 1, 2010, a lower
manufacturer's list price than the maximum accepted list price
calculated under subsection (2), the maximum accepted list price for
drugs in the LCA category is the manufacturer's list price, as of July
1, 2010, of the lower priced drug.
(4)
The minister may deem, at any time, an LCA category established before
April 1, 2013, to have been established on or after
April 1, 2013, in which case,
(a)
the maximum accepted list price for drugs in the LCA category is to be
determined in accordance with section 4
[LCA categories established on or after April 1, 2013]
, and
(b)
for the purposes of section 4 (2.1), the date on which a generic drug
is first assigned to the LCA category is deemed to be the date on
