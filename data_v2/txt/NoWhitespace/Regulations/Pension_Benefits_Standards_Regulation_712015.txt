was established, and
(c)
the sum of the payments over the period referred to in paragraph (a),
or any shorter period selected by the administrator for the purposes
of this subsection, is equal to the sum of the payments that would

[am. B.C. Regs. 264/2019, s. 11; 196/2022, s. 15.]
Funding requirements applicable to target benefit provisions
58
(0.1)
In this section:
"establishment date"
, in the case of an unfunded liability of a target benefit component
of a pension plan, means
(a)
the review date as at which the existence of the unfunded liability
was established, or
(b)
if the unfunded liability resulted from an amendment to the plan text
document of the plan, the effective date of the amendment;
"expected average remaining service life"
, in relation to a target benefit component of a pension plan, means
the expected average number of years or portions of years that the
reviewer who prepared the current actuarial valuation report estimated
to be worked by active members accruing benefits under the component,
from the review date of the current actuarial valuation report until
the anticipated date that each active member terminates active
membership, based on the demographic assumptions used in the most
recent actuarial valuation;
"unfunded liability payment period"
, in relation to an unfunded liability of a target benefit component
of a pension plan, means
(a)
in the case of a plan other than a jointly sponsored plan, the shorter
of
(i)
the 15-year period that begins on the establishment date of the
unfunded liability, and
(ii)
the expected average remaining service life that begins on the
establishment date of the unfunded liability, or
(b)
in the case of a jointly sponsored plan, the shorter of
(i)
the 15-year period that begins on the first anniversary of the
establishment date of the unfunded liability, and
(ii)
the expected average remaining service life that begins on the first
anniversary of the establishment date of the unfunded liability.
(1)
This section applies to a pension plan of which the plan text document
contains one or more target benefit provisions.
(2)
Subject to subsection (4), a plan contributor must, in accordance with
this subsection, pay the following into the plan or, in the case of a
divisional multi-employer plan, pay the plan contributor's share of
the following into the plan:
(a)
at least monthly, an amount that is equal to 1/12 of the target
benefit component's normal actuarial cost determined on the basis of
the current actuarial valuation report or cost certificate,
(i)
starting in the first month of the fiscal year of the plan following
the review date, in the case of a plan other than a jointly sponsored
plan, or
(ii)
starting in the first month of the second fiscal year of the plan
following the review date, in the case of a jointly sponsored plan;
(b)
at least monthly, an amount equal to the product of the PfAD and the
amount referred to in paragraph (a);
(c)
without limiting any other obligation on the plan contributor to make
payments under this section in relation to any previous unfunded
liability of the target benefit component, if the current actuarial
valuation report establishes the existence of an unfunded liability
for the target benefit component, a series of equal payments that are
made at least monthly, which series of payments must be sufficient, in
the opinion of the reviewer who prepared that actuarial valuation
report, to amortize the unfunded liability within the unfunded
liability payment period applicable to it.
(3)
If, under section 92 of the Act, the plan text document of a pension
plan is amended to convert a defined benefit provision to a target
benefit provision, the payments required under subsection (2) (b) in
relation to that target benefit provision need not begin until the
third anniversary of the date on which the conversion occurred.
(4)
Instead of making the payments referred to in subsection (2) (c) in
relation to an unfunded liability, the plan contributor may elect to
make payments into the plan under this subsection if
(a)
the payments are made at least monthly over the unfunded liability
payment period applicable to the unfunded liability,
(b)
the payment amounts are identical and are calculated as a percentage
of the payroll or as an average amount per hour of employment that, as
at the review date of the actuarial valuation report by which the
existence of the unfunded liability was established, was projected for
the members, and
(c)
the actuarial present value of the payments over the period referred
to in paragraph (a), or any shorter period selected by the
administrator for the purposes of this subsection, is equal to the
unfunded liability.
(5)
Without limiting subsections (2) and (4), each unfunded liability must
be funded by a separate series of payments under subsection (2) (c) or
(4) and must not be combined with any other unfunded liability.
(6)
If the current actuarial valuation report prepared in relation to a
pension plan establishes that the total amount of all unfunded
liabilities of the plan component is less than the total amount of all
unfunded liabilities projected for the plan component in the
previously filed actuarial valuation report, the amount of that
actuarial gain must be used
(a)
to eliminate every unfunded liability of that plan component, or
(b)
if the amount of that actuarial gain is insufficient to eliminate
every unfunded liability of the plan component, to reduce the unfunded
liabilities of the plan component, with the unfunded liabilities of
the plan component being eliminated or reduced chronologically,
beginning with the oldest unfunded liability.
(7)
If the target benefit component's actuarial gain is used in the manner
referred to in subsection (6) (b) to reduce the amount of an unfunded
liability, the payments that are, under subsection (2) or (4),
required to be made in relation to that unfunded liability may be
(a)
reduced, on a prorated basis, and paid over
(i)
the remainder of the applicable unfunded liability payment period, or
(ii)
a shorter period, or
(b)
left unreduced and paid over a shorter period than the applicable
unfunded liability payment period.
(8)
If a target benefit component of a pension plan has accessible going
concern excess, the accessible going concern excess may
(a)
be left in the target benefit component,
(b)
subject to section 21 of the Act and sections 21 and 22 of this
regulation, be used to increase benefits under the target benefit
provision, or
(c)
subject to section 63 (3) (c) of the Act and
section 3 (2.1) of this regulation, be used or applied in
relation to the component to meet the funding requirements applicable
to the target benefit component or in any other way contemplated by
the plan text document.
(9)
If a plan contributor is required under subsection (2) or (4) to make
payments in relation to an unfunded liability, the plan contributor
may make larger payments, more frequent payments or earlier payments
than what is required, and, in that event, the plan contributor may,
despite subsections (2) and (4), reduce or eliminate subsequent
payments provided that
(a)
the unfunded liability is eliminated within the applicable unfunded
liability payment period, and
(b)
the balance of the unfunded liability never exceeds the amount of that
unfunded liability that would have existed had the full amount of the
payments required under subsection (2) or (4) been made.
(10)
The reviewer preparing an actuarial valuation report in relation to a
pension plan must
(a)
determine whether the expected contributions will be sufficient to
meet the funding requirements applicable to the target benefit
component, and
(b)
if the reviewer determines that the expected contributions are not
sufficient to meet the funding requirements applicable to the target
benefit component,
(i)
promptly advise the administrator, and
(ii)
propose measures to the administrator that will ensure that
contributions will be sufficient to meet the funding requirements
applicable to the target benefit component.
(11)
If the administrator of the plan receives the advice referred to in
subsection (10) (b) in relation to the plan, the
administrator must,
(a)
promptly after receiving the advice, notify the superintendent that
the contributions to the plan required by the plan documents in
relation to the target benefit component are not sufficient to meet
the funding requirements applicable to that component, and
(b)
concurrently with or before the filing of the actuarial valuation
report,
(i)
satisfy the superintendent that a contribution increase, sufficient to
allow the plan to meet the funding requirements applicable to the
target benefit component, has been incorporated into the applicable
collective agreement, if any, or
(ii)
under section 20 (2) (b) of the Act, amend the plan text document to
reduce or eliminate benefits or increase contributions.
(12)
Despite any other provision of this section, this section applies to
designated plans as defined in the Income Tax Regulations (Canada) but
only to the extent allowed under those regulations.

16.]
Smoothing restrictions
59
If, in preparing an actuarial valuation report in relation to a
pension plan of which the plan text document contains a benefit
formula provision, the reviewer uses an averaging method that
stabilizes short-term fluctuations in the market value of the assets
of the benefit formula component when determining the going concern
assets value of the component, the method by which and the period over
which the averaging occurs must be satisfactory to the superintendent.
Stress testing
60
When preparing an actuarial valuation report in relation to a pension
plan of which the plan text document contains a target benefit
provision, the reviewer must do the following in a manner satisfactory
to the superintendent:
(a)
select the factors that, in the reviewer's opinion, pose a material
risk to the plan's ability to meet the funding requirements under
section 58;
(b)
reflect, in the actuarial valuation report, for each of the selected
risk factors, any material changes that would be necessitated in the
report if a situation contemplated by that risk factor changed in a
reasonably foreseeable way without any of the other situations
contemplated by any of the other risk factors changing;
(c)
explain the justification for selecting the risk factors referred to
in paragraph (a) and the situational changes considered under
paragraph (b).

For the purposes of subsection (9) (d), if all or part of the unfunded
liability is the result of a benefit improvement, the benefits that
led to the establishment of the unfunded liability must be reduced in
proportion to the extent to which those benefits remain unfunded on a
going concern basis on the effective date of the termination of the
plan.
(11)
Promptly after the allocation under subsection (9) is completed, the
assets must be distributed as allocated.
(12)
