referred to in paragraph (a),

number the remaining names on the list in order of preference, and
(iii)
deliver the amended list to the roster organization;

if a participant does not deliver the amended list within the time
referred to in paragraph (b), the participant is deemed to have
accepted all of the names;
(d)
within 7 days after the expiry of the 10 day period referred to in
paragraph (b), the roster organization must select the mediator from
the remaining names on the list or, if no names remain on that list,
from any available mediators, whether or not the selected mediator was
included on the original list provided under paragraph (a), taking
into account
(i)
the order of preference indicated by the participants on the returned
lists,

(iii)
the qualifications of the mediator,
(iv)
the mediator's fees,

(a)
the facts on which the participant intends to rely, and
(b)
the matters in issue in the action.

(3)

parties.
(4)
Despite subsection (3), nothing in subsection (2) or in the fee
declaration under this section precludes there being included in the
costs awarded to a party in the designated action an amount to
compensate the party for the share of the cost of the mediation that
that party paid under the declaration.
Conduct of a mediation
10
The mediator may conduct the mediation in any manner the mediator
considers appropriate to assist the participants to reach a resolution
that is timely, fair and cost-effective.

12
(1)
If a Declaration of Default is filed, the court may, on application
made on notice to the participant in respect of whom the Declaration
of Default is filed, do any one or more of the following unless that
participant satisfies the court that the default did not occur or that
there is a reasonable excuse for the default:
(a)
adjourn the application and order that a mediation session occur, on
any terms the court considers appropriate;

adjourn the application and order that a participant attend a
mediation session;

dismiss the proceeding or strike out the response to civil claim and

making any order about costs, whether following final disposition of
an action, or otherwise.
[am. B.C. Reg. 155/2010, s. 4.]
