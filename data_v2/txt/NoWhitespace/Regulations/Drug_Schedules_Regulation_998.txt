common name, in type size not less than one-half as large as the
largest type on the label, and the product is sold in the original
manufacturer's container.

by a pharmacist to a practitioner or on the prescription of a
practitioner in accordance with the bylaws to the
Pharmacy Operations and Drug Scheduling Act
.
Schedule II

on a non-prescription basis and which must be retained within the
Professional Service Area of the pharmacy where there is no public
access and no opportunity for patient self-selection.
Schedule III

to any person from the self-selection Professional Products Area of a
licensed pharmacy.
