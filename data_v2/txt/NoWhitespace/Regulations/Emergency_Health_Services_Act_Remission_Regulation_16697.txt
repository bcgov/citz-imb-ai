Remission Regulation
[Last amended January 1, 2020 by B.C. Reg. 180/2019]
Remission of fees
1
Authorization is given for the remission of fees authorized by the
Emergency Health Services Act
where:
(a)
on the date ambulance services were provided, the person was a
recipient of income assistance from the ministry of the minister
responsible for the administration, except as it relates to the child
in the home of a relative program, of the
Employment and Assistance Act
and to impose the fee would be likely to cause great hardship to the
person;
(b)
on the date ambulance services were provided, the person was a
recipient of premium assistance or supplemental services under the
Medicare Protection Act
and to impose the fee would be likely to cause great hardship to the
person;
(c)
fire or police personnel require services as a result of an injury
occurring in the course of this employment and to impose the fee would
be likely to create great public inconvenience;
(c.1)
Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 16/2008.]
(d)
the service rendered to a person is incommensurate with the fee as
prescribed, and to impose the fee would be a great injustice or would
be likely to cause great hardship to the person;
(e)
the initial invoice for the provision of ambulance services to a
person was not issued by the ministry of the minister responsible for
the administration of the
Ministry of Health Act
within 12 months of the date those services were provided, and to
impose the fee on the person after that period of time would likely
create great hardship for that person;
(f)
delays by the ministry of the minister responsible for the
administration of the
Ministry of Health Act
in issuing the initial invoice for the provision of ambulance services
have created great hardship for the person who must pay the fee
because another person or an insurer refuses to pay that fee as a
result of the delay.
