Well Distances
Hazard planning distances for wells are determined by reference to the
maximum potential hydrogen sulphide (H
2
S) release rates from a well during disposal, drilling, completion,
re-completion or production operations.
H
2
S Release Rates
Disposal operations
The maximum potential H
2
S release rates during disposal operations must be determined using the
maximum reservoir pressure value set out in the order, made under
section 75 of the Act, designating the disposal well as a special
project for disposal operations.
Drilling operations
The maximum potential H
2
S release rates during drilling operations must be determined as
follows:
1 For a proposed well, the maximum gas rate (AOF) values and maximum H
2
S concentrations for each H
2
S-bearing formation must be determined for each of at least 5 wells
drilled and tested in an analogous geological area or pool within 5 km
of the proposed well.
2 The H
2
S release rates for all potential H
2
S-bearing formations in the proposed well must be determined based on
the highest AOF and highest H
2
S concentration for each formation and the sum of the H
2
S release rates for all the formations that will be open to the well
bore during drilling operations.
3 If appropriate data does not exist or is otherwise inadequate, the
hazard planning distance is 3 km.
Completion or re-completion operations
For completion or re-completion operations in an existing well, data
from the appropriate formation in the well must be used to determine H
2
S release rates, but if the appropriate data does not exist or is
otherwise inadequate, H
2
S release rates must be determined in accordance with the equations and
notes set out below for production operations.
Production operations
The maximum potential H
2
S release rates during production operations must be determined in
accordance with the following equation and the notes that follow:
H
2
S Release Rate =
H
2
S% x AOF
8 640 000
where
H
2
S%
=
volume of H
2
S expressed as a percentage of the total volume of gas;
AOF
=
maximum gas rate (m
3
/d).
Notes:
1 For gas wells, if an AOF test has been conducted and value determined
for a formation in a well, that value must be used. If an AOF test value
has not been determined, a theoretical AOF must be calculated using the
following formula:
AOF =
Gas Test Rate x Pr
2
(Pr
2
- Pf
2
)
where
AOF
=
maximum gas rate (m
3
/d);
Gas Test Rate
=
gas flow rate during testing (m
3
/d);
Pr
=
reservoir pressure (kPa).
Pf
=
flowing bottom hole pressure (kPa);
2 For oil wells, the AOF must be calculated using the following formula:
AOF =
Oil Test Rate x GOR
[1 — 0.2 x (Pf/Pr) — 0.8 x (Pf/Pr)
2
]
where
AOF
=
maximum gas rate (m

/d);
Oil Test Rate
=
oil flow rate during testing (m

GOR
=
gas-oil ratio from oil test rate well (m

Pf

Pipeline Distances
Hazard planning distances for pipelines are determined by reference to
the maximum potential hydrogen sulphide (H

applicable of the following equations. The hazard planning distance for
pipelines is the distance indicated on the vertical axis of Chart C that
corresponds to the release volume indicated on the horizontal axis of
