pursuant to replaceable contracts described in subsection (1),
(b)
pursuant to dedicated phase contracts, and
(c)
by employees of a licence holder as part of company operations

the proportion of timber harvesting services provided under
replacement contracts entered into after August 31, 1991 if the
parties have, in good faith and in the ordinary course of business,
specified in the contract a fixed or determinable amount of work,
(b)
the specified percentage as calculated, if taken together with the
amount of work specified in each of the other replaceable contracts
entered into by the licence holder with respect to timber harvesting
operations under that licence, would require a reduction in the
proportion of timber harvesting operations historically performed by
company operations under that licence, or
(c)
the amount of work performed by the contractor in the later of 1991
and the calendar year that the contractor first became entitled to a
replaceable contract

[en. B.C. Reg. 149/2021, s. 19.]
Rate test considerations
26.02
(1)
In applying the rate test set out in section 26.01, an arbitrator may
consider the following:
(a)
the fixed and variable costs incurred by the contractor, including
(i)
equipment costs,
(ii)
labour costs,
(iii)
costs of extras, and
(iv)
administrative and overhead costs;
(b)
any rates agreed on by the licence holder and the contractor for prior
timber harvesting services;
(c)
the costs incurred by and the productivity of the contractor in
providing prior timber harvesting services;
(d)
the costs incurred by and the productivity of other persons in the
forest industry in each phase or component of similar timber
harvesting services;
(e)
the rates agreed on by other persons in the forest industry for
similar timber harvesting services;
(f)
if necessary to make meaningful comparisons with any of the rates
described in paragraphs (b) and (e) and with any of the
costs and productivity described in paragraphs (c) and (d),
the differences between the timber harvesting services that pertain to
the rate in dispute and the timber harvesting services that pertain to
the rates described in paragraphs (b) and (e) or to the
costs and productivity described in paragraphs (c) and (d),
including
(i)
differences in operating conditions including differences in terrain,
yarding, distances, hauling distances and volume of timber per
hectare,
(ii)
differences in the total amount of timber processed,
(iii)
differences in the required equipment configuration,
(iv)
differences in required phases,
(v)
differences in operating specifications,
(vi)
differences in law,
(vii)
differences in contractual obligations,
(viii)
differences in the underlying costs of timber harvesting services in
the forest industry generally that would affect rates, including
changes in the cost of labour, fuel, parts and supplies, and
(ix)
differences in the cost of moving to a new operating area, if any;
(g)
any other similar data or criteria that the arbitrator considers
relevant.
(2)
In applying the rate test set out in section 26.01, an arbitrator must
not consider any rates that do not allow for meaningful comparisons
with the rate in dispute, including the following:
(a)
rates for which there is insufficient information available in order
to make meaningful comparisons;
(b)
rates that differ significantly from most of the rates agreed on for
similar timber harvesting services in similar circumstances;
(c)
rates for incremental work that exceeds the amount of work under a
contract;
(d)
rates for which negotiations involved non-monetary consideration;
(e)
rates established by arbitration;
(f)
rates agreed on under replaceable and non-replaceable contracts before
the date this section comes into force;
(g)
rates agreed on under contracts for timber harvesting services on land
other than Crown land.
(3)
In applying the rate test set out in section 26.01, an arbitrator must
not consider any goodwill or other intangible asset associated with
purchasing a replaceable contract or otherwise acquiring the right to
provide timber harvesting services under a replaceable contract.
[en. B.C. Reg. 149/2021, s. 19.]
Transition
26.03

licence holder under section 27, the contractor must give written
notice of the objection to the licence holder within 30 days of
delivery of the AAC reduction proposal to that contractor.
Deemed acceptance of proposal
30
If no contractor gives the licence holder written notice of an
objection under section 29 the AAC reduction proposal is deemed
to be accepted and each contract entered into by the licence holder
with respect to that licence is deemed to be amended or terminated as
provided for in the AAC reduction proposal.

If a licence holder receives a notice of objection with respect to a
AAC reduction proposal in accordance with section 29, the licence
holder may
(a)
withdraw the AAC reduction proposal, or

proposal, the licence holder is deemed to have withdrawn the AAC
reduction proposal.
Dispute resolution proceedings for an AAC reduction proposal
32
If a licence holder refers an AAC reduction proposal to mediation and
arbitration as provided for in section 31, a single dispute is
deemed to exist as of the date of referral between the licence holder
and all contractors with replaceable contracts entered into with
respect to timber harvesting operations carried out under the licence,
and the dispute must be resolved by mediation and arbitration under
the system established in Division 2 of Part 4 subject to
the following:
(a)
the licence holder and each contractor who has a replaceable contract
to carry out one or more phases of the licence holder's timber
harvesting operations under the licence to which the AAC reduction
proposal relates must be parties to the mediation and, if the
mediation is not successful, the arbitration and any reference to
"party" or "parties" in Division 2 of Part 4 must be read

arbitrator believes most fairly takes into account each of the AAC
reduction criteria;
(h)
for greater certainty, in making a decision with respect to the
dispute
(i)
an arbitrator is not restricted to choosing between any of the various
AAC reduction proposals made by the parties to the arbitration, and
(ii)
an arbitrator may make an award that includes the termination of one
or more of the replaceable contracts, or reduces the amount of work
available to any contractor or company operation in a manner that is
not proportionate to the reduction in AAC.
[am. B.C. Reg. 278/2004, s. 22.]
Contractor may elect to terminate
33
A replaceable contract must provide that if the amount of work
available under the contract is reduced as a result of a reduction in
the AAC of a licence, or the cancellation, expiry or surrender of a
licence to which a fibre basket agreement applies, the contractor may,

(b)
the seniority system is not changed by a forestry revitalization
proposal, and
(c)
the licence, or licences in a fibre basket agreement, to which the

criteria, the licence holder may, within 30 days of the
determination by the conciliator and by written notice to each
contractor with a replaceable contract that pertains to the forestry

revitalization proposal by the time specified in
section 33.2 (3).
(3)
A licence holder who has elected or is deemed to have elected
proportionate reduction under section 33.43, 33.5 or 33.51

is the damages that the conciliator determines would be payable
based on a wrongful termination of a replaceable contract with
an amount of work equal to the difference between

contractor based on a proportionate reduction, and
(ii)
the amount of work each year as proposed for that contractor in

which determination is to be made without reference to any
requirement by the contractor to mitigate the loss associated
with that difference whether under the Forestry Revitalization
Trust or otherwise, and
Y
is the amount of mitigation funds that a contractor will receive
under the Forestry Revitalization Trust based on a reduction in
amount of work equivalent to the difference between

licence, the licence holder may at any time before
January 1, 1997, substitute any replaceable contract
relating to the licence for that non-replaceable contract for the
purpose of compliance with the contractor clause.
Coastal area compliance
40
The holder of a replaceable tree farm licence for the coastal area
complies with the contractor clause only if the volume of timber that
is required to be harvested under the licence by a person under
contract is so harvested under any combination of full contracts, each
of which provides for a term of at least 5 years, and phase
contracts each of which provides for a term of at least 2 years.

Q
is the volume of timber harvested under the licence,
R
is the total cost for the appropriate phase contract in the year
of construction or maintenance, as the case may be, and
S
is the total cost incurred by the licence holder for all phases
of the timber harvesting operation on the licence, and
