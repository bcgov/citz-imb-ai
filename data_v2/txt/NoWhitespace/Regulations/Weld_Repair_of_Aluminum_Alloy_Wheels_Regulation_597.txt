determine whether the facility has adequate equipment, a qualified
weld repair supervisor and a qualified welder working to approved
welding standards.
(2)
The information required by section 6 (4) (b) must be retained and
made available for inspection by a certifier for a period of
7 years after it was recorded.
Repair or discard decision
9
(1)
The weld repair supervisor must decide to either repair or discard a
damaged aluminum alloy wheel.
(2)
Non-destructive testing is not required but may be performed to
augment the process of determining whether to repair or discard a
damaged wheel.
(3)
If the weld repair supervisor decides that the damaged wheel cannot be
safely repaired, the wheel must be discarded and permanently stamped
with the word "UNSAFE", using characters not less than 5 mm in
height, on the inside of the wheel rim adjacent to the valve stem
hole.

wheel as shown in Schedule 2.
(2)
Cosmetic weld repair is allowed on the entire wheel, including weld
repair of surface nicks and gouges which do not affect the structural
integrity of the wheel.
(3)
If the weld repair supervisor decides that the damaged wheel cannot be
safely repaired, the wheel must be discarded and permanently stamped
with the word "UNSAFE", using characters not less than 5 mm in

description of test methods and acceptance criteria. The welding test
must be performed using one of 5083, 5086 or 6061 aluminum flat plate
with an 8 mm (5/16 inch) material thickness and full
penetration weld.
3
A welder must meet all of the following test standards:
Pass/Fail Test Standard
Type of Test
Qty
Acceptance/Rejection Criteria
Face bend
2
After bending, a flaw exceeding 3 mm (1/8 inch) in length is a
failure.
Root bend
2
After bending, a flaw exceeding 3 mm (1/8 inch) in length is a
failure.
Macro etch test
2
Incomplete penetration achieved through thickness of material
welded is a failure.
Tensile test
2
A reduction of the ultimate tensile strength of aluminum alloy is
a failure.
Fracture test
