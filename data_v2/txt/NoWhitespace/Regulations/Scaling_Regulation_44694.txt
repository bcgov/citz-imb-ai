Scaling Procedures
Time of scaling
2
The owner of the timber and a person who has a right to the timber as
a holder of an agreement under section 12 of the Act must ensure
that timber required to be scaled under the Act is scaled as soon as
possible after the timber is cut.
[en. B.C. Reg. 270/97, s. 1.]
Late scale requirement
3
(1)
If the minister determines that timber required to be scaled under the
Act has not been scaled as soon as possible after the timber is cut,
the minister may order that the timber be scaled using a method
approved by the minister.
(2)
If the minister is not satisfied with the reliability of the scale
under subsection (1), the minister may order another scale to be
undertaken to replace the scale.
(3)
If, in the opinion of the minister,
(a)
the volume of the timber has changed, or
(b)
the quality of the timber has deteriorated,
between the time the timber should have been scaled under
section 2 and the time the timber is scaled under
subsection (1) or (2), the scale under subsection (1) or (2)
must be done by estimating, by a method approved by the minister, the
volume and grade of the timber at the time the timber should have been
scaled under section 2.
[en. B.C. Reg. 270/97, s. 2; am. B.C. Regs. 89/2011, Sch. s. 1;
76/2022, s. 3.]
Bucking at the scale site
4
(1)
A person must not cut timber that has arrived at a scale site until
the timber has been scaled, except in accordance with an order or
permission under subsection (2).
(2)
The minister may, to ensure accurate scaling, order or permit a scale
site owner or operator to cut the timber before scaling.
(3)
The order or permission may specify
(a)
the circumstances under which the timber may or must be cut, and
(b)
the point at which the timber may or must be cut.
(4)
A scale site owner or operator must comply with an order under this
section.
[am. B.C. Reg. 89/2011, Sch. s. 2.]
Type of scale
5
(1)
Timber that is required by the Act to be scaled must be scaled by one
of the following methods:
(a)
by determining the volume and classifying the quality of each piece of
timber,
(b)
by determining the volume and classifying the quality of samples of
the timber, or
(c)
by determining the volume and classifying the quality of timber using
a method approved by the minister
(i)
for the purposes of section 3 (1) of this regulation,
(ii)
to account for timber lost during water transportation, as reported
under section 2 (3) of the Timber Marking and Transportation
Regulation, or
(iii)
for the circumstances specified by the minister.
(1.1)
Timber scaled under subsection (1) (b) must be scaled in accordance
with a sampling plan approved by the minister as follows:
(a)
all the timber is segregated by timber mark and weighed;
(b)
the approved sampling plan requires the measuring of a sufficient
number of samples to provide an estimate of the total volume of timber
included under the sampling plan that has a statistical reliability of
plus or minus 1%, 19 times out of 20;
(c)
the sum of the volume of a number of pieces of timber of the same
species and grade, as measured in the sample, is rounded to the
nearest 0.01 m
3
;
(d)
the quotient resulting from dividing the sample volume, as determined
under paragraph (c), by the sample weight is calculated to 5 decimal
places.
(2)
An approval under subsection (1) (b) or (c) may be withdrawn at any
time by the minister in order to ensure accurate scaling.
(3)

Type of scale — special forest products
5.1
Special forest products that are required by the Act to be scaled must
be scaled by one of the following methods:
(a)
for special forest products other than Christmas trees, by determining
either the volume or the volume and quality of the special forest
products, using a method approved by the minister;
(b)
for Christmas trees,
(i)
by classifying each tree by species and by length as less than 3 m, as
3 m to 5 m or as more than 5 m, and
(ii)
by counting the number of trees in each classification.
[en. B.C. Reg. 89/2011, Sch. s. 7.]
Scaling procedures
6
A person who scales timber under section 5 (1) (a) or a sample of
timber under section 5 (1) (b) must
(a)
measure, with a scale stick,
(i)
the diameter of the area inside the bark of each end, and
(ii)
where required by the minister, any other diameter,
(b)
record the radius of each end to the nearest centimetre,
(c)
if a piece of timber has an irregular cross section,
(i)
determine the approximate area of the cross section after measuring 2
or more axes of the cross section, and
(ii)
determine and record the radius of a circle with the area determined
under paragraph (i),
(d)
if there is visible flare in a butt log, project the line of normal
taper of the log to the large end and measure only the part of the
diameter that is located inside the line of normal taper,
(e)
measure and record the length of a piece of timber between 2 planes
that are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the piece and
situated at the geometric centre of each end face,
(f)
if the minister directs that a diameter be measured at a place other
than the end, measure the length between every adjacent diameter, and
measure the diameters and record the log as 2 or more pieces,
(g)
record the length measured under paragraphs (e) and (f)
(i)
to the nearest tenth of a metre, or
(ii)
if the measurement is 0.05 metres from the nearest tenth of a metre,
to the nearest even tenth of a metre,
(h)
if there are one or more defects in the form of rotted, holed or
charred wood,
(i)
reduce the measured radii or length of a piece of timber accordingly
and record measurements that compute the firmwood volume of the piece
of timber, or
(ii)
record the type and required dimensions of the defect or defects, and
reduce the gross scale of the piece of timber by the computed volume
of the defect or defects,
(i)
classify and record each piece of timber by timber mark, species and
grade and, in the case of parcels containing logs with no readily
discernible timber mark, record the mark as "NMV" to indicate that no
mark is visible,
(j)
mark each piece, unit or parcel of timber at the time of making the
scale with an identifiable mark to indicate that it has been scaled,
and
(k)
classify the grade of timber in accordance with sections 7 to 9.
[am. B.C. Regs. 69/2004, s. (a); 15/2006, s. 1; 89/2011, Sch. s. 8.]
Schedule of timber grades
7
Timber must be classified by grade in accordance with
(a)
the Schedule of Coast Timber Grades, if timber is cut in a forest
region or part of a forest region where the policies and procedures
approved by the minister under section 105 (1) (c) of the Act specify
that log selling prices must be used to determine the rates of
stumpage applicable to the timber, or
(b)
the Schedule of Interior Timber Grades if paragraph (a) does not
apply.
[am. B.C. Regs. 270/97, s. 4; 237/2013, App. 3, s. 1.]
Timber grade selection
8
If timber matches the description in the schedules for more than one
grade, it must be placed
(a)
unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies, in the grade in which it first
appears in the schedules,
(b)
unless paragraph (c) applies, in the undersize grade if it matches the
undersize grade description, or
(c)
in the firmwood reject grade if it matches the firmwood reject grade
description.
Measurements in the schedules
9
(1)
If a log or slab is measured for the purpose of determining in which
grade it belongs in the schedules,
(a)
subject to subsection (2), length measurements used must be the actual
unrounded measurement in metres, and
(b)
radius, width and thickness measurements must be in centimetres and
must be rounded to the nearest whole centimetre except that a half
centimetre must be rounded to the nearest even whole centimetre, and
if the measurement is 15 cm or less it must be the actual unrounded
measurement.
(2)
If timber is bucked into logs less than 5.2 metres in length on the
Coast or 2.5 metres in length in the Interior
(a)
in order to facilitate the removal or transportation of the timber,
(b)
for the purpose of scaling, or
(c)
for the purpose of manufacturing a forest product
each bucked log is, for the purpose of classifying timber, deemed to
be 5.2 metres in length on the Coast and 2.5 metres in length in
the Interior.
(3)
The radius for the purposes of classifying the grade of timber under
section 7 is, if timber is greater than
(a)
12.8 metres in length on the Coast, the radius measured 12.8 metres
from the large end of the log, or
(b)
8 metres in length in the Interior, the radius measured at the
mid-point of the log.
[am. B.C. Regs. 62/2001; 256/2007, s. 1.]
Calculation of volume
10
To calculate scale volume using the British Columbia metric scale a
person must determine
(a)
the volume of a piece of timber in the following manner:
(i)
the area of each end must be calculated in square metres by
multiplying the square of each radius by 3.141592 and dividing by 10
000;
(ii)
the sum of the areas of each end of the piece of timber expressed in
square metres must be divided by 2 and the result multiplied by the
measured length in metres;
(iii)
the result of the calculation must be rounded to the nearest 0.001 m
3
, and
(b)
the sum of the volume of a number of pieces of timber of the same
species, grade and having the same timber mark, by rounding the sum of
the volumes to the nearest 0.1 m
3
or, if measured in a sample, to the nearest 0.01 m
3
.
