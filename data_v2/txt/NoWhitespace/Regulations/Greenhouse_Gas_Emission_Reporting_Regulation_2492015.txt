[am. B.C. Reg. 294/2020, s. 2.]
Attribution of emissions for reporting purposes
3
(1)
Emissions are attributable for a reporting period, for the purpose of
section 3
[emission reports]
of the Act, to an industrial operation that is a single facility
operation if, during the reporting period,
(a)
the operation carries out an activity listed in column 2 of Table 1 of
Schedule A,
(b)
the operation emits a greenhouse gas from a source type listed in
column 3 of Table 1 of Schedule A opposite the activity, and
(c)
the greenhouse gas emitted is a greenhouse gas type listed in column 4
of the applicable table opposite the source type listed in column 3.
(2)
Emissions are attributable for a reporting period, for the purpose of
section 3 of the Act, to an industrial operation that is a linear
facilities operation if, during the reporting period,
(a)
the operation carries out an activity listed in column 2 of Table 1 or
Table 2 of Schedule A, other than an activity listed in item 2 of
Table 1,
(b)
the operation emits a greenhouse gas from a source type listed in
column 3 of Table 1 or Table 2 of Schedule A opposite the activity,
and
(c)
the greenhouse gas emitted is a greenhouse gas type listed in column 4
of the applicable table opposite the source type listed in column 3.
(3)
In addition to emissions reportable under subsections (1) and (2), if
a single facility operation or a linear facilities operation combusts
coal, the emissions associated with the storage of that coal, as
determined using the methodologies specified in a code, standard or
rule referred to in item 7, column 5 in Table 1 of Schedule A, are
attributable for the purposes of section 3 of the Act.
(4)
Emissions are attributable, for the purpose of section 3 of the Act,
to an industrial operation that is an electricity import operation if
the emissions are associated with production of the electricity
imported by the operator of the electricity import operation, as
determined using the applicable methodologies set out in Schedule D.
Attribution of emissions for compliance purposes
4
(1)
The following emissions are attributable for a compliance period, for
the purpose of section 6
[compliance obligation]
of the Act, to a regulated operation that is a single facility
operation or a linear facilities operation:
(a)
emissions attributable to the regulated operation for the purposes of
reporting under section 3 of the Act but not including reporting-only
emissions of the operation;
(b)
in the case of an LNG operation, emissions attributable, as set out in
Table 3 of Schedule A, to the production and transmission of
electricity used at the LNG operation, unless the emissions from the
production of the electricity are attributable under paragraph (a);
(c)
in the case of an LNG operation that obtains natural gas that has been
purified or compressed for liquefaction purposes by a facility of a
different industrial operation, the emissions that would be
attributable under this section to the facility as part of a linear
facilities operation were that different industrial operation an LNG
operation;
(d)
in the case of an LNG operation that stores LNG with a facility of a
different industrial operation or uses a facility of a different
industrial operation for loading LNG for transport, the emissions that
would be attributable under this section to the facility as part of a
linear facilities operation were that different industrial operation
an LNG operation.
(2)
If a facility described in subsection (1) (c) or (d) provides
purification, compression, storage or loading services to more than
one LNG operation, on application to the director by an operator of
one of those operations, the director may approve the prorating of
emissions referred to in those paragraphs among those LNG operations
for a compliance period.
(3)
If an industrial operation becomes an LNG operation part way through a
compliance period, emissions otherwise attributable to the industrial
operation for reporting purposes before the date the first LNG is
produced are not attributable for the compliance period for the
purposes of section 6 of the Act.
Public sector organizations

in Table 3 of Schedule A, one or more methodologies for quantifying
emissions from an activity listed in columnÂ 2 are specified for
the activity in a code, standard or rule set out opposite in
columnÂ 3,
the operator of the reporting operation must use one of those
methodologies to quantify the amount of emissions from that source
type or activity, as applicable.
(3)
The operator of an electricity import operation must quantify
emissions
(a)
attributable to specified imports and specified exports, as defined in
section 1 of Schedule D, in accordance with section 3 of that
Schedule, and
(b)
attributable to unspecified imports and unspecified exports, as
defined in section 1 of Schedule D, in accordance with section 4 of
that Schedule.
(4)
Subsections (2), (5), (6) and (7) do not apply to electricity import
operations.
(5)
If the code, standard or rule referred to in subsection (2) specifies
different methodologies for different circumstances, the operator of
the reporting operation must use the methodology appropriate to the
circumstances.
(6)
The operator of a reporting operation may quantify attributable
emissions from one or more units, processes, activities or operations
for which particular methodologies are specified under subsections (2)
and (5) by using a replacement methodology not referred to in
subsectionÂ (2) if
(a)
the total amount of all emissions quantified using the replacement
methodologies does not exceed the lower of the following:
(i)
20Â 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;
(ii)
3% of the total emissions attributable to the reporting operation
during the reporting period, not including carbon dioxide produced
from biomass listed in ScheduleÂ C, and

the replacement methodology will not lead to a bias in the amount of
emissions quantified using the replacement methodology.
(7)
If, as a result of an amendment to column 5 of Table 1 or 2 of
Schedule A or an amendment to a standard referred in column 5 of those
tables, an operator would be required for a reporting period to use a
methodology for measuring a parameter that the operator was not
required to use in the previous reporting period, the operator may,
for the first reporting period for which the new methodology is
required, use an alternative measurement methodology inconsistent with
that methodology if
(a)
it is not practicable to use the required parameter measurement
methodology because the operator has not been able to establish
systems necessary to use that methodology within the time necessary to
use that methodology for the reporting period,
(b)
the alternative parameter measurement methodology is as accurate as
practicable, and
(c)
for an alternative parameter measurement methodology used after March
31 of the reporting period, the methodology has been approved by the
director.

If the director has not taken an action under subsection (9) by
MarchÂ 3 of the reporting period, the application is deemed to be
approved.
[am. B.C. Reg. 42/2022, s. 4.]
Choice between direct measurement and mass balance-based methodology
16
(1)
In this section,
"mass balance-based methodology"
means a methodology that involves quantifying emissions by applying
the principle of mass conservation to the feedstock consumed and
emissions or other substances produced by a process, and includes
quantifying emissions by applying an emissions factor to a volume or
mass of fuel or other feedstock.
(2)
If, in circumstances authorized under this regulation, the operator
has the option to choose between a direct measurement methodology and
a mass balance-based methodology to quantify emissions, the operator
must continue to use the chosen methodology for all future emission
reports unless
(a)
a change in methodology is approved in advance by the director, or
(b)
the applicable emissions are less than the lower of the following:
(i)
20 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;
(ii)
3% of the total emissions attributable to the reporting operation
during the reporting period, not including carbon dioxide produced
from biomass listed in Schedule C.
(3)
If, in circumstances authorized under this regulation, the operator
has the option to choose between 2 or more direct measurement
methodologies to quantify emissions, the operator must continue to use
the chosen methodology for all future emission reports unless
(a)
a change in methodology is approved in advance by the director,
(b)
the change in methodology is to a higher numerically rated calculation
method,
(c)
the change in methodology is to a more accurate calculation method, or
(d)
the applicable emissions are less than the lower of the following:
(i)
20 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;
(ii)
3% of the total emissions attributable to the reporting operation
during the reporting period, not including carbon dioxide produced
from biomass listed in ScheduleÂ C.
(4)
For certainty, subsection (2) does not apply to an operator who, in
respect of a previous reporting period or portion of a reporting
period, had the option to choose between a direct measurement
methodology and a mass balance-based methodology to quantify
emissions, but no longer has that option because
(a)
of the adoption of, or a change in, the methodologies specified for
that source type in a code, standard or rule referred to in
columnÂ 5 of TableÂ 1 or 2 of ScheduleÂ A, or
(b)
the emissions exceed the threshold for use of replacement
methodologies under section 15Â (6)Â (a).
(5)
For certainty, subsection (3) does not apply to an operator who, in
respect of a previous reporting period or portion of a reporting
period, had the option to choose between 2 or more direct measurement
methodologies to quantify emissions, but no longer has that option
because
(a)
of the adoption of, or a change in, the methodologies specified for
that source type in a code, standard or rule referred to in
columnÂ 5 of TableÂ 1 or 2 of ScheduleÂ A, or
(b)
the emissions exceed the threshold for use of replacement
methodologies under section 15Â (6)Â (a).
(6)
The operator of a reporting operation previously operated by another
operator must use the methodology chosen by the previous operator
(a)
under subsection (2), unless paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection
applies, or
(b)
under subsection (3), unless paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of that
subsection applies.
Instrumentation

other written specifications, if those specifications would result in
an instrumentation reading that is at least as accurate as the
manufacturer's specifications, and
(b)
meet the requirements of a standard, code or rule referred to in
column 5 of Table 1 or 2 of Schedule A applicable to the source type
of the emissions.
