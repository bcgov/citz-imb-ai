(a)
the demand-side measure individually,
(b)
the demand-side measure and other demand-side measures in the
portfolio, or
(c)

(1.1)
The commission must make determinations of cost-effectiveness by
applying the utility cost test as follows and in the order set out:

subject to subsections (1.2) and (1.3), the avoided natural gas cost,
if any, respecting a demand-side measure, in addition to the avoided
capacity cost, is as follows:

in the 2023/2024 fiscal year, the amount is $34.07 per GJ;
(ii)
for fiscal years subsequent to the 2023/2024 fiscal year, the amount

calendar year;
(b)
subject to subsection (1.3), the avoided electricity cost, if any,
respecting a demand-side measure, in addition to the avoided capacity
cost, is
(i)
in the case of a demand-side measure of FortisBC Inc., an amount that
the commission is satisfied represents FortisBC Inc.'s long-run
marginal cost of acquiring electricity generated from clean or
renewable resources in British Columbia, and

reduces the use of natural gas but does not reduce greenhouse gas
emissions associated with that use of natural gas.
(1.3)
Subsection (1.1) (a) and (b) does not apply to a demand-side measure
that encourages a switch from the use of oil or propane to the use of
natural gas or electricity such that the switch would decrease
greenhouse gas emissions in British Columbia.

In considering a demand-side measure that, in the commission's
opinion, will increase the use of a regulated item with respect to
which there is either
(a)
a specified standard that has not yet commenced, or
(b)
a specified proposal,
the commission, after applying subsection (1.1), may increase the
benefit of the demand-side measure by an amount that represents a
portion of the avoided capacity and energy costs that, in the
commission's opinion, will result from the commencement and
application of the specified standard, amendment or new bylaw proposed
by the specified proposal, assuming that the standard, amendment or
new bylaw comes into force.
(1.5) to (2)
Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 167/2023, s. 4 (f).]

cost-effective unless the application of the utility cost test results
in a benefit to cost ratio equal to or greater than 50.
(3)
Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 228/2011, s. 2 (d).]
(4)
The commission must determine the cost-effectiveness of a class A
demand-side measure proposed in a plan portfolio or an expenditure
portfolio by determining whether the portfolio is cost effective as a
whole.

proposed in a plan portfolio or an expenditure portfolio is likely to
accomplish the goals set out in paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition
of "public awareness program", the commission must determine the
