Application
2
This regulation establishes the circumstances and conditions that
apply to the exercise of the privileges granted by section 122 (1) of
the
Motor Vehicle Act
.
Pursuit by police
3
(1)
To engage in or continue a pursuit, a peace officer must
(a)
have an emergency light and siren activated, and
(b)
have reasonable grounds to believe that
(i)
the driver or a passenger in the vehicle being or to be pursued has
committed, is committing or is about to commit an offence, and
(ii)
the seriousness of the offence and the need for immediate apprehension
outweigh the risk to the safety of members of the public that may be
created by the pursuit.
(2)
In considering whether there are reasonable grounds under subsection
(1) (b), the driver of the emergency vehicle must consider any
pertinent factors, including the following, if relevant:
(a)
the nature and circumstances of the suspected offence or incident;
(b)
the risk of harm posed by the manner in which the emergency vehicle is
being or is likely to be operated;
(c)
the risk of harm posed by the distance, speed or length of time
required or likely to be required to exercise the privileges;
(d)
the nature, condition and use of the highway;
(e)
the volume and nature of pedestrian or vehicular traffic that is, or
might reasonably be expected to be, in the area.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (1) (b),
(a)
the need for immediate apprehension will be low if
(i)
the driver or a passenger in the vehicle pursued has not committed an
indictable offence, or
(ii)
identification or apprehension of the suspected offender may be
achieved by other means at that or a later time,
(b)
the greater the distance, speed or length of time required or likely
to be required for the pursuit, the greater the risk to the safety of
members of the public, and
(c)
an attempt to evade apprehension is not a factor to be considered in
determining the seriousness of the offence or the need for immediate
apprehension.
[am. B.C. Reg. 136/2007, s. 2.]
Emergency response by peace officer
4
(1)
A peace officer operating an emergency vehicle for purposes other than
pursuit may exercise the privileges granted by section 122 (1) of the
Motor Vehicle Act
if
(a)
the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the risk of
harm to members of the public from the exercise of those privileges is
less than the risk of harm to members of the public should those
privileges not be exercised, and
(b)
the peace officer operates the following emergency equipment, as
applicable:
(i)
in the exercise of privileges described in section 122 (1) (a) to (c)
of the
Motor Vehicle Act
, an emergency light and siren;
(ii)
in the exercise of privileges described in section 122 (1) (d) of the
Motor Vehicle Act
, an emergency light or an emergency light and siren.
(2)
Having determined that there are reasonable grounds referred to in
subsection (1) (a), the peace officer referred to in subsection (1)
may, in the following circumstances, exercise any of the privileges
granted by section 122 (1) of the
Motor Vehicle Act
without operating an emergency light and siren or by operating an
emergency light alone:
(a)
the peace officer is responding to an incident and has reasonable
grounds to believe that an offence has been, is being or is about to
be committed and that the risk of harm to members of the public
entailed in operating an emergency siren or an emergency light and
siren, as the case may be, outweighs the risk of harm to members of
the public entailed in not operating them;
(b)
the peace officer is engaged in the lawful execution of the peace
officer's duty other than as described in paragraph (a) or section 3
and has reasonable grounds to believe that it is safe to operate the
emergency vehicle without operating an emergency siren or an emergency
light and siren, as the case may be.
(3)
In considering whether there are reasonable grounds under subsection
(1), (2) or (5) a peace officer must
(a)
consider the factors described in section 3 (2), and
(b)
weigh the degree of risk of harm to members of the public against the
seriousness of the nature and circumstances of the suspected offence
or incident.
(4)
Subsection (2) does not apply if the peace officer must disregard a
stop sign or approach or pass signs described in section 147 of the
Motor Vehicle Act
relating to schools and playgrounds.
(5)
A peace officer operating an emergency vehicle in the circumstances
set out in subsection (2) must stop at a red light and may then
disregard the red light and proceed through the intersection if the
peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe it is safe to do so
without operating relevant emergency equipment.
(6)
Factors which will increase the risk of harm to members of the public
for purposes of subsections (1), (2) and (5) include
(a)
attempting to close the distance between a peace officer's vehicle and
another vehicle,
(b)
if there is poor visibility,
(c)
if there is pedestrian or other vehicular traffic on the highway, and
(d)
if the peace officer must disregard a yield sign or pass through a
crosswalk or uncontrolled intersection.
(7)
For the purposes of subsection (2), the greater the distance, speed or
length of time required or likely to be required in exercising the
privileges granted by section 122 (1) of the
Motor Vehicle Act
, the greater the risk to the safety of members of the public.
(8)
For the purposes of subsection (2), the risk of harm to members of the
public must be considered to be substantially increased when a peace
officer is attempting to close the distance if the other vehicle is
not in the sight of the peace officer.
