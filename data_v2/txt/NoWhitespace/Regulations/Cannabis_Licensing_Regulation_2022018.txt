Monetary Penalties and Licence Suspensions
Definitions
1
In this Schedule:
"contravention"
in respect of a licensee refers to a licensee's contravention of a
provision of the Act or this regulation or a licensee's failure to
comply with a term and condition of the licence, that is set out under
the heading "Contravention" in the table to this Schedule;
"licensee"
includes a former licensee.
Type of contravention
2
A contravention is of the same type as another contravention if each
contravention falls within the same item in the table to this
Schedule.
First, second and subsequent contraventions
3
(1)
A contravention is a first contravention in respect of a licensee if
(a)
the contravention was committed at or in respect of an establishment
under the licensee's licence, and
(b)
the licensee has not committed a contravention of the same type at or
in respect of that establishment within the 12-month period preceding
the commission of the contravention.
(2)
A contravention is a second contravention in respect of a licensee if
(a)
the contravention was committed at or in respect of an establishment
under the licensee's licence, and
(b)
the licensee has committed one contravention of the same type at or in
respect of that establishment within the 12-month period preceding the
commission of the contravention.
(3)
A contravention is a subsequent contravention in respect of a licensee
if
(a)
the contravention was committed at or in respect of an establishment
under the licensee's licence, and
(b)
the licensee has committed a second contravention of the same type at
or in respect of that establishment within the 12-month period
preceding the commission of the contravention.
(4)
If the general manager is satisfied that imposing the monetary penalty
or period of suspension for a second contravention or subsequent
contravention set out in the table to this Schedule would create undue
hardship on a licensee, the general manager may impose a monetary
penalty or period of suspension set out in the table to this Schedule
for a first contravention.
