Part 1
Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 214/2004, s. 9 (a).]
Part 2 â€” Modified Leachate Extraction Procedure
(1) Sampling
1.1 For wastes with 0.5% solids weight by volume or greater, collect a
sufficient amount of sample to provide approximately 100 g of solid
material using techniques which ensure that the sample is representative
of the waste.
1.2 If the waste has less than 0.5% solids weight by volume, collect at
least 1 L of sample.
(2) Equipment
2.1 Sieve, 9.5 mm mesh opening, stainless steel or plastic material.
2.2 Stainless steel filtration unit, 142 mm diameter, minimum 1 L
capacity, capable of sustaining a pressure of 5 kg/cm
2
, applied to the material to be filtered.
2.3 Membrane filter, 142 mm diameter, 0.45 Âµm diameter pore size, made
of synthetic organic material such as cellulose acetate, cellulose
nitrate, nylon or polycarbonate and which is compatible with the
leachate to be filtered. Teflon is recommended for organic constituents.
2.4 Glass fibre prefilter, 124 mm diameter 3 Âµm to 12 Âµm pore size
range.
2.5 Vacuum filtration unit, 90 mm diameter.
2.6 Membrane filter 90 mm diameter as per Step 2.3.
2.7 Glass fibre filter 70 mm diameter as per Step 2.4.
2.8 Solid waste rotary extractor â€” a device that rotates the bottles end
over end about a central axis through 360Â°, with a speed of 10 rpm. The
dimensions of the box will depend on the needs of each laboratory
(Figure 1).
2.9 Structural Integrity Tester with a 3.18 cm diameter hammer weighing
0.33 kg and having a free fall of 15.24 cm (Figure 2).
2.10 pH meter, with a readability of 0.01 pH unit and accuracy of Â± 0.1
pH units.
2.11 Cylindrical bottles, wide mouth, 1 250 mL capacity, polyethylene or
glass with Teflon-lined cap for inorganic constituents; glass with
Teflon-lined cap or Teflon bottles for organic constituents.
2.12 Cleaning Procedure
All glassware and equipment that comes into contact with the sample must
be cleaned in the following way before each use:
2.12.1 Wash with a non-phosphate detergent solution.
2.12.2 Rinse twice with tap water.
2.12.3 Rinse twice with reagent water.
2.12.4 Wash with 10% nitric acids.
2.12.5 Rinse several times with reagent water.
2.12.6 Store bottles filled with 10% nitric acids, until ready to use.
2.12.7 Rinse several times with reagent water before use.
2.12.8 Rinse clean oven dried bottles with methylene chloride, followed
by methanol, for organic constituents.
(3) Reagents
3.1 Reagent water, Type IV (ASTM specification D1193).
3.2 Nitrogen gas, pre-purified, scrubbed through a molecular sieve.
(4) Separation procedure
If the sample is not a dry solid separate it into its component phases
using the following procedure:
4.1 Determine the dry weight of the solids in the sample at 60Â°C, using
a well homogenized sample. Use this weight to determine the amount of
material to be filtered.
4.2 Assemble the filtration unit with a filter bed consisting of a 0.45
Âµm pore size membrane filter and a coarse glass fibre pre-filter
upstream of the membrane filter (per manufacturer's instructions).
4.3 Select one or more blank filters from each batch of filters. Filter
50 mL portions of reagent water through each test filter and analyze the
filtrate for the analytical parameters of interest. Note the volume
required to reduce the blank values to acceptable levels.
4.4 Wash each filter used in the leach procedure with at least this
predetermined volume of water. Filter under pressure until no water
flows through the filtrate outlet.
4.5 Remove the moist filter bed from the filtration unit and determine
its weight to the nearest Â± 0.01 g.
4.6 Re-assemble the filtration unit, replacing the filter beds, as
before.
4.7 Comminute the sample, with a mortar and pestle, to a size that will
pass through the opening of the filtration unit (less than 9.5 mm).
4.8 Agitate the sample by hand and pour a representative aliquot part of
the solid and liquid phases into the opening of the filtration unit.
Filter a sufficient amount of the sample to provide at least 60 g of dry
solid material.
4.9 Pressurize the reservoir very slowly with nitrogen gas by means of
the regulating valve on the nitrogen gas cylinder, until liquid begins
to flow freely from the filtrate outlet.
4.10 Increase the pressure in increments of 0.5 kg/cm
2
to a maximum of 5 kg/cm
2
, as the flow diminishes. Continue filtration until the liquid flow
ceases or the pressurizing gas begins to exit from the filtrate outlet
of the filter unit.
4.11 De-pressurize the filtration unit slowly using the release valve on
the filtration unit. Remove and weigh the solid material together with
the filter bed to Â± 0.01 g. Record the weight of the solid material.
4.12 Measure and record the volume and pH of the liquid phase. Store the
liquid at 4Â°C under nitrogen until required in Step 5.8.
4.13 Discard the solid portion, if the weight is less than 0.5% (w/v) of
the aliquot part taken and proceed to step 5.9. If not, proceed to Step
5.1.
Note: For mixtures containing coarse grained solids, where separation
can be performed without imposing a 5 kg/cm
2
differential pressure, a vacuum filtration unit with a filter bed as per
Step 4.2 may be used. Vacuum filtration must not be used if volatile
organic compounds are to be analysed.
(5) Extraction procedure
5.1 Prepare a solid sample for extraction by crushing, cutting or
grinding, to pass through a 9.5 mm mesh sieve. If the original sample
contains both liquid and solid phases, use the solid material from Step
4.13. The structural integrity procedure, Step 6, must be used for
monolithic wastes which are expected to maintain their structural
integrity in a landfill, (e.g. some slags and treated solidified
wastes).
Note: Do not allow the solid waste material to dry prior to the
extraction step.
5.2 Determine the moisture content of the de-watered sample, by drying a
suitable aliquot part to constant weight at 60Â°C in an oven. Discard the
dried solid material.
5.3 Place the equivalent of 50 g dry weight of the de-watered undried
material into a 1 250 mL wide mouth cylindrical bottle. Use additional
bottles if a larger volume of leachate is required for the analysis.
5.4 Add 800 mL (less the moisture content of the sample in mL) of
reagent water to the bottle.
5.5 Cap the bottle and agitate it in the rotary extractor for 1 hour.
5.6 Add enough reagent water at the end of the extraction period so that
the total volume of liquid is 1 000 mL.
5.7 Separate the material into its component liquid and solid phases as
described under the Separation Procedure, Step 4. Discard the solid
portion.
Note: It may be necessary to centrifuge the suspension at high speed
before filtration, for leachates containing very fine grained particles.
5.8 Calculate the amount of free liquid from Step 4.12 corresponding to
50 g of the dry solid material. Add this amount to the leachate from
Step 5.7.
Note: If the analysis is not performed immediately, store separate
aliquot parts of the leachate at 4Â°C, after adding appropriate
preservatives for the analytical parameters of interest.
5.9 If the weight of the solid portion in Step 4.1 was less than 0.5%
(w/v), analyze the free liquid from Step 4.13; otherwise, analyze the
combined solutions from Step 5.8 for contaminants listed in Table 1 of
this Schedule that are likely to be present.
5.10 Report concentrations of contaminants in the combined leachate and
the free liquid solution as mg/L.
(6) Structural integrity procedure
6.1 This procedure may be required prior to extraction for some samples
as indicated in Step 5.1. It may be omitted for wastes with known high
structural integrity.
6.2 Fill the sample holder with the material to be tested. If the sample
of the waste is a large monolithic block, cut a portion from the block
measuring 3.3 cm in diameter by 7.1 cm in length. For a treated waste
(e.g. solidified waste) samples may be cast in a form with the above
dimensions for the purposes of conducting this test. In such cases, the
waste must be allowed to cure for 30 days prior to further testing.
6.3 Place the sample holder in the structural integrity tester, then
raise the hammer to its maximum height and allow it to fall. Repeat this
procedure 14 times.
6.4 Remove the material from the sample holder, and proceed to Step 5.2.
If the sample has not disintegrated, it may be sectioned; alternatively
use the entire sample (after weighing) and a sufficiently large bottle
as the extraction vessel. The volume of reagent water to be initially
added is 16 mL/g of dry sample weight. The maximum amount of 0.5 N
acetic acid to be added is 4 mL/g of dry sample weight. The final volume
of the leachate should be 20 mL/g of dry sample weight.
