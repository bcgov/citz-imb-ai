for all employees for British Columbia for that month and, under
paragraph (b), for each month remaining in that year.

April 1, 2022 and for each fiscal year after that, adjust
the gross yearly employment income of each of the employments

yearly employment income by an indexing factor obtained as follows:
index factor =
average AWW of the current 5-year period
average AWW of the previous 5-year period
where
AWW
=
the average weekly wages of the employments, as given in the
Labour Force Survey for British Columbia published by Statistics
Canada each year, corresponding to the NOC code in column 1
in Table 1 having a 1-character code;
current 5-year period
=
the most recent five calendar years completed before April 1 of
the year for which the indexing factor is computed;
previous 5-year period
=
the next to last 5-year period, where the fifth year is the
calendar year completed before April 1 of the year for which the
indexing factor is computed, minus one year.
(2)
The corporation must, for the fiscal year beginning on
April 1, 2022 and for each fiscal year after that, adjust
the gross yearly employment income of each of the employments
corresponding to the NOC code in column 1 in Table 1 having

yearly employment income by an indexing factor obtained as follows:
index factor =
average AWW of the current 5-year period
average AWW of the previous 5-year period
where
AWW
=
the average weekly wages of the employments, as given in the
Labour Force Survey for British Columbia published by Statistics
Canada each year, corresponding to the NOC code in
column 1 in Table 1 having a 2-character code;
current 5-year period
=
the most recent five calendar years completed before
April 1 of the year for which the indexing factor is
computed;
previous 5-year period
=
the next to last 5-year period, where the fifth year is the
calendar year completed before April 1 of the year for
which the indexing factor is computed, minus one year.
(3)
The index factor determined under subsection (2) applies to the
employments corresponding to the NOC code in column 1 in
Table 1 having a 3- or 4-character code where the first 2
characters are the same as in subsection (2).
(4)
In a year in which Statistics Canada fails to publish a new Labour
Force Survey for British Columbia, the corporation may revise and
adjust the AWW levels set out in the table in accordance with any
statistical index or other publication that provides information
similar to, or comparable with, that provided by the Labour Force
Survey.
If employment not listed in table
44
If an employment is not listed in Table 1, or where the table does not
give an income for the employment, the corporation may determine an
income for that employment using the National Occupational
Classification and Table 1 as a guide.

levels set out in Table 1 to reflect the income levels set out in
the new census.

Updates of AHW
48
The corporation must, for the fiscal year beginning on

the AHW of each occupation in Table 2 by an AHW figure calculated
as follows:
AHW =
sum of the AUHW in each year of the current 5-year period
5
where
AUHW
=
the average usual full-time weekly hours worked by each
occupation in Table 2 given in the Labour Force Survey for
British Columbia published by Statistics Canada each year;
current 5-year period
=
the most recent 5 calendar years completed before April 1
of the year for which the AUHW figure is computed.
Employment or AHW not listed
49
If an employment is not listed in Table 1 in the Schedule or where
Table 2 does not give an AHW for the occupation to which the
determined employment belongs, the corporation may determine the
average full-time weekly hours worked for that employment using the
National Occupational Classification and the tables as a guide.
Labour force survey data unavailable
