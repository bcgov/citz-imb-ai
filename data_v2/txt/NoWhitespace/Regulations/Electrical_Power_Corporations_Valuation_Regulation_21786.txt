voltage of up to 347/600 volts or at a primary voltage of up to
19.9/34.5 kV;
"tower"
means a tower of an electrical power corporation which is used for the
purposes of telecommunications, unless the value of that tower has
been included in an electrical power distribution line rate or an
electrical power transmission line rate;

Electrical power corporation special cases
5
(1)
Where, in respect of an electrical transmission or distribution line
referred to in section 21 (1) (a) of the
Assessment Act
,
(a)
a senior executive of the corporation provides the assessment
authority with documentation certifying that the cable has been
properly abandoned, and
(b)
the transmission or distribution line would, if valued under section
19 of the
Assessment Act
and in that reference to section 21 of the
Assessment Act
, have no value,
the actual value of the transmission or distribution line must be
determined using a rate of one dollar.
(2)
Where, in respect of an electrical power transmission or distribution
line which remains in place but for any reason has not been utilized
for a period of one year or more, the actual value must be determined
by applying 10% of the rate prescribed for its class.

Electrical power lines under construction
6
Where an electrical power transmission or distribution line referred
to in section 21 (1) (a) of the
Assessment Act
is under construction, the assessor must determine the percentage
complete as of October 31 and the actual value of the line must
be determined by applying the percentage complete to the rate
prescribed for that class.
