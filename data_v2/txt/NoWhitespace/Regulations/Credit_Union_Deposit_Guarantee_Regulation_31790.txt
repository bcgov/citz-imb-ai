beneficiaries generally,
whether or not the identity of each beneficiary is disclosed in the
records of the credit union.
Separate deposit
2
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), each of the following constitutes a
separate deposit in a credit union for the purpose of applying the
$100 000 limit in section 266 (2) of the Act:
(a)
the aggregate of all deposits that
(i)
are shown in the records of the credit union as trust accounts, and
(ii)
deposited in trust for the benefit of the same beneficiary
whether or not the identity of the beneficiaries is disclosed in the
records of the credit union;
(b)
the aggregate of all deposits that are shown in the records of the
credit union as joint accounts to the credit of the same joint
depositors;
(c)
the aggregate of all deposits that are shown in the records of the
credit union as registered retirement savings plans under the
Income Tax Act
(Canada) to the credit of the same depositor;
(d)
the aggregate of all deposits that are shown in the records of the
credit union as registered retirement income funds under the
Income Tax Act
(Canada) to the credit of the same depositor;
(e)
the aggregate of all deposits that are not referred to in paragraphs
(a) to (d) that are credited to the same depositor in the records of
the credit union.
(2)
Where funds are deposited in trust for the benefit of the same
beneficiary in more than one pooled trust account and the
beneficiaries of each of those accounts are not identical, the funds
deposited for that beneficiary in each of those accounts constitute a
separate deposit in a credit union for the purpose referred to in
subsection (1).
Separate deposits on business acquisition
or amalgamation
3
(1)
Where, immediately before completion of an asset transfer agreement or
amalgamation agreement, a person had separate deposits (the
"pre-existing separate deposits") in any credit union that is a party
to the agreement, then, in a determination under section 2 of what
constitutes a separate deposit in the acquiring credit union or
amalgamated credit union after completion of the agreement, each
pre-existing separate deposit of that person shall, notwithstanding a
requirement to the contrary in section 2, be considered
independently from and without regard to any other pre-existing
separate deposits of that person until but not after the first to
occur of
(a)
withdrawal of all money from that separate deposit, or
(b)
the lapse of 5 years after
(i)
the date of business acquisition, if the agreement is an asset
transfer agreement, or
(ii)
the date of amalgamation, if the agreement is an amalgamation
agreement.
(2)
Where, but for subsection (1), money in a depositor's separate deposit
would not be guaranteed, the aggregate of all guarantees for all the
depositor's separate deposits in the acquiring credit union or
amalgamated credit union is reduced by the amount of any withdrawals
from those deposits that are made after the date of business
acquisition or the date of amalgamation, as the case may be, until the
aggregate of all the guarantees for those deposits does not exceed the
aggregate of all the maximum guarantees that would have applied to
those deposits in the absence of subsection (1).
(3)
Where, after the date of business acquisition or amalgamation, as the
case may be, a depositor deposits money in a separate deposit that has
been carried over to the acquiring credit union or amalgamated credit
union, the depositor is not entitled to claim under section 266 (3) of
the Act in respect of that money unless the depositor would have been
entitled to claim under section 266 (3) of the Act in the absence of
subsection (1).
(4)
Where, after the date of business acquisition or amalgamation, as the
case may be, a term deposit in the acquiring credit union or
amalgamated credit union expires and is immediately reinvested in any
other deposit of that depositor in that credit union, that transaction
does not constitute a withdrawal for the purpose of subsection (1) or
(2) and does not constitute a deposit for the purpose of subsection
(3).
