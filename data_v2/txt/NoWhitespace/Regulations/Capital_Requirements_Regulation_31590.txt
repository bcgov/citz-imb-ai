For the purposes of sections 2 to 6,

Determination of capital base
2
(1)
For the purposes of the Act and this regulation, the capital base of a
financial institution is the aggregate amount of its capital items of
the types specified in section 3 adjusted by
(a)
applying any discounts under section 6 on capital items,
(b)
deducting, to the extent specified in section 5 (1), the total amount
of its assets of the types specified in that section, and
(c)
taking into account the requirements respecting secondary capital set
out in section 4.
(2)
Notwithstanding subsection (1), the capital base of an insurance
association is the excess of total assets over total liabilities.
[am. B.C. Regs. 427/93, s. 2; 488/98, s. 1.]
Special rules respecting the capital base of credit unions
2.1
(1)
In this section:
"credit union"
does not include a central credit union;
"retained earnings"
includes that portion of a credit union's contributed surplus which
was, prior to the amalgamation of the credit union with one or more
other credit unions or prior to the acquisition of assets by a credit
union from another credit union under an asset transfer agreement,
retained earnings of the credit union.
(2)
Subject to subsections (4) to (8), at least 35% of the capital base of
a credit union as determined under section 2 (1) must consist of the
credit union's retained earnings.

If, on or after December 31, 2004, a credit union meets the
requirement of subsection (2) but, at any time after that, its capital
base as determined under section 2 (1) does not consist of at least
35% of retained earnings, then the capital base of the credit union is
an amount equal to the credit union's retained earnings divided by
35%.
(5)
Subsection (2) does not apply for a period of 10 years commencing
immediately after a new credit union is issued a business
authorization to carry on deposit business.
(6)
If the new credit union referred to in subsection (5) fails to meet
the 35% requirement of subsection (2) at any time after the 10 year
period, then the capital base of the credit union is an amount equal
to the credit union's retained earnings divided by 35%.
(7)
Subsection (2) does not apply to an amalgamated credit union resulting
from the amalgamation of a credit union with one or more other credit
unions or the acquisition of assets by a credit union from another
credit union under an asset transfer agreement, for 5 years from the
date that the most recent business authorization to carry on deposit
business was issued to one of the credit unions.
(8)
If an amalgamated credit union fails to meet the 35% requirement of
subsection (2) within the time referred to in subsection (7), then the
capital base of the credit union is an amount equal to the credit
union's retained earnings divided by 35%.

any rights or special rights of the kind described in paragraph (a)
(ii) that are attached to the shares are restricted so that the

one year period, unless required to do so by or under an enactment or
by a court order, and

(2)
Secondary capital of a financial institution may be counted in the
determination of its capital base only to the extent that the
secondary capital comprises an amount equal to 100% or less of the
aggregate of all other capital items specified in section 3, and to
that intent, the amount of secondary capital used in calculations to
determine capital base shall be reduced as necessary to achieve that
result.
(3)

(e) is
(a)
capital raised by it under an equity share other than an equity share
described in section 3 (a) or (b),
(b)
capital raised by it under a security instrument that represents
indebtedness but

does not, under any circumstances during the term of the security
instrument, require the financial institution to repay, redeem,
purchase or otherwise acquire all or any part of the indebtedness
(A)
until a fixed due date or fixed maturity date, or
(B)
unless required to do so by or under an enactment or by a court order,
and

total assets of all credit unions.
