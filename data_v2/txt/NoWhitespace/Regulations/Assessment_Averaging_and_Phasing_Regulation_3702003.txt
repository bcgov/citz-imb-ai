Assessment Averaging and Phasing Regulation
[includes amendments up to B.C. Reg. 292/2007, September 24, 2007]
Definition
1
In this regulation,
"assessment averaging or assessment phasing bylaw"
means a bylaw imposing tax rates under section 198
[assessment averaging and phasing options]
of the
Community Charter
.
Restriction on property classes
2
An assessment averaging or assessment phasing bylaw is restricted to
property classes 1, 5, 6 and 8.
Assessment averaging option
3
For assessment averaging under section 198 of the
Community Charter
, the tax rates may be imposed on the amount determined in accordance
with the following formula:
Amount = averaged land value + assessed improvements value
where
averaged land value
=
average of the assessed value of the land in the current year
and the 2 preceding years;
assessed improvements value
=
the assessed value of improvements in the current year.
Assessment phasing option
4
For assessment phasing under section 198 of the
Community Charter
, the tax rates may be imposed on the amount determined in accordance
with the following formula:
Amount = (assessed land value − phasing reduction) + assessed
improvements value
where
assessed land value
=
the assessed value of the land in the current year;
phasing reduction
=
the amount determined by multiplying
(a)
the phasing percentage established by the assessment phasing
bylaw, being not less than 50% and not more than 66%,
by
(b)
the difference between
(i)
the increase in the assessed value of the land in the current
year from the previous year, and
(ii)
the assessed value of the land in the previous year multiplied
by the average percentage increase in the assessed value from
the previous year to the current year of all land within the
municipality included in the same property class;
assessed improvements value
=
the assessed value of improvements in the current year.

properties within the municipality must be published in accordance
with section 94
[requirements for public notice]
of the
Community Charter
;
(c)
the bylaw must be adopted before March 31 in the year in which it is

[am. B.C. Reg. 292/2007, s. 4.]
Variation and modification authority
6
(1)
An assessment averaging or assessment phasing bylaw may modify the
averaging formula in section 3 of this regulation or the phasing
formula in section 4 of this regulation to
(a)
exempt from the bylaw, or
(b)
govern the application of the bylaw to,
particular types of property within a property class.
(2)
The authority under subsection (1) includes authority in relation to
property with an assessed value that is different from that on the
previous assessment roll because of one or more of the following:
(a)
an error or omission;
(b)
a subdivision or consolidation or a new development to, on or in the
land;
(c)
a change in
(i)
physical characteristics,
(ii)
zoning,
(iii)
the classification of the property under section 19 (14) of the
Assessment Act
, or
(iv)
the eligibility of the property for assessment under section 19 (8),
23 or 24 of the
Assessment Act
.
Application to taxes for non-municipal purposes
7
(1)
If a council adopts an assessment averaging or assessment phasing
bylaw, the following rules apply:
(a)
the assessed value or the net taxable value must continue to be the
basis for determining the amount of money to be raised in the
municipality for the purposes of the following:
(i)
section 197 (1) (b)
[property taxes for other bodies]
of the
Community Charter
;
(ii)
sections 119 and 137 of the
School Act
;
(iii)
section 17 of the
Assessment Authority Act
;
(iv)
sections 15 and 17 of the
Municipal Finance Authority Act
;
(v)
section 14 of the
British Columbia Transit Act
;
(b)
the value determined under the bylaw, and not the assessed value or
the net taxable value referred to in this or any other Act, must be
the basis for taxing properties within the property classes specified
in the bylaw to raise the money required under the provisions referred
to in paragraph (a).
(2)
If
(a)
a body other than the council sets a rate under an enactment for
calculating property taxes, and
(b)
the council adopts an assessment averaging or assessment phasing
bylaw,
then, despite any other enactment, the council must, by resolution,
substitute a rate that is sufficient to raise the same amount of
revenue in the municipality for that body from each property class to
which the assessment averaging or assessment phasing bylaw applies as
the amount that would have been raised for that body had that bylaw
not been adopted.
(3)
If the amount of revenue raised in any year for a body under
subsection (2) is more or less than the amount that would have been
raised had the council not substituted the rate, the difference must
be used to adjust the rate for the next year.
Notice of adjusted assessment
8
(1)
If the assessed value of a parcel of land on the assessment roll has
been adjusted under an assessment averaging or assessment phasing
bylaw, the tax notice under section 237
[general tax notices]
of the
Community Charter
for the parcel must include, or have enclosed with it, a statement
(a)
informing the owner that assessed values and tax rates have been
adjusted as a result of the bylaw,
(b)
specifying the adjusted value of the land and the value of any
improvements on it, and
(c)
describing the procedure for requesting the collector to correct
errors and for complaining about errors to the review panel referred
to in section 9 of this regulation.
(2)
On the initiative of the collector or on the request of an owner who
is notified under subsection (1) of adjustments to the assessed value
of the owner's property, the collector may correct errors made in
applying the bylaw to any property.
Review panel
9
(1)
If a council adopts an assessment averaging or assessment phasing
bylaw, it must establish a review panel in the same manner as a parcel
tax roll review panel under section 204
[parcel tax roll review panel]
of the
Community Charter
.
(2)
The review panel may
(a)
adjudicate complaints about errors made in applying the bylaw to the
assessed value of any property, and
(b)
direct the collector to make any amendments to the adjusted value of
the property that are necessary to give effect to the panel's
decision.
