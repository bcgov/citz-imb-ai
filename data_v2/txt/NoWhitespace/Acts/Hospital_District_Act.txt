send to

each member municipality a requisition stating the amount required of
that member municipality, and
(b)
each taxing treaty first nation a requisition stating the amount
required of that taxing treaty first nation and the rates applied to
the net taxable value of land and improvements in the treaty lands or
applicable portion of those treaty lands to determine that amount.
(2)
All amounts requisitioned under subsection (1) are a debt due by the
member municipality or the taxing treaty first nation to the district,
and the council of that member municipality or the governing body of
that taxing treaty first nation must provide for that debt and must
pay that debt to the board on or before August 1 in the current year.
(3)
In the case of each member of the district that is not a city,
district, town, village or treaty lands of a taxing treaty first
nation, the secretary of the district must, after the information

minister responsible for the
Financial Administration Act
, on or before April 20, a requisition stating the amount
required of that member, and a copy of the requisition must be sent to

the total of the amounts being requisitioned under this section for
the purposes of this Act;

a taxing treaty first nation;
(c)
the rates that if applied to the net taxable value of land and
improvements in the treaty lands, or applicable portion of those
treaty lands, of a taxing treaty first nation would generate the
amount requisitioned from the taxing treaty first nation under
subsection (1).
(5)
If there is a municipal regional district co-extensive with a district
incorporated under this Act, the 2 districts must use their best
endeavours to ensure that the taxation requisitions of each of them
are sent to their respective member municipalities and the taxing
treaty first nations in the regional district at the same time.
(6)
The amounts requisitioned under subsection (3) must be paid from the
consolidated revenue fund to the board on or before August 1 in the
current year.

set out in the information made available under subsection (9) are
adjusted, any resulting adjustment of grants, or of the amounts to be
raised by taxation and to be requisitioned from each part of the
district, by a sum in excess of $1 000 must be taken into account and
adjusted by the minister in the next year, unless otherwise ordered by
the Lieutenant Governor in Council.
(8)
On or before February 1 in each year, the amount received by a
municipality, or by the Surveyor of Taxes by way of a grant in place

in Schedule III or IV of that Act in the immediately
preceding calendar year must be paid to the board, and the amount paid
must be included in the revenue of the board in its budget.
(9)
The information referred to in subsections (1), (3) and (7) is the
information made available annually to each board by the British

Taxation

(1)
For the purpose of this section, the definitions of "land" and
"improvements" in the

apply.

All amounts requisitioned under section 25, other than from a taxing
treaty first nation, must be raised by taxation at a uniform rate for
each class of property throughout the district by the member
municipality or municipalities and the Provincial Collector.
(2.1)
The requirement under subsection (2) that rates be uniform for each
class of property is not contravened solely because the Surveyor of
Taxes has added an aggregate fee, as defined in section 21.1 of
the
Taxation (Rural Area) Act
, to the amounts to be levied as taxes under section 25 of this
Act.
(3)
Despite any other Act relating to the assessment of values, in order

Act.

imposed for each property class.

as the exigency of the case demands, and securities may be issued up
to the principal amount authorized by any such bylaws, even if the net
sum realized after payment of the discount, commission, brokerage,
