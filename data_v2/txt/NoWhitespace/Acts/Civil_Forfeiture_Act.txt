was the rightful owner of the subject property before the unlawful
activity occurred and was deprived of possession or control of the

unlawful activity occurred and did not know and could not reasonably
have known at the time of the acquisition that the property was
proceeds of unlawful activity.

A defence under subsection (4) (b) fails if the court finds that the
claimant did not directly or indirectly engage in the unlawful
activity that would have been the basis of the proceedings under
