Commission may order extension of existing service
30

the cost by the persons affected.

only and without unduly preventing the use of the street or other

commission considers reasonable and proper.

the commission or any other law.

(a)
as to rate or service, subject any person or locality, or a particular
description of traffic, to an undue prejudice or disadvantage, or
(b)
extend to any person a form of agreement, a rule or a facility or
privilege, unless the agreement, rule, facility or privilege is
regularly and uniformly extended to all persons under substantially
similar circumstances and conditions for service of the same
description.

Setting of rates
60
(1)
In setting a rate under this Act

(i)
is not unjust or unreasonable within the meaning of section 59,

reasonable return on any expenditure made by it to reduce energy
demands, and

if the public utility provides more than one class of service, the
commission must
(i)
segregate the various kinds of service into distinct classes of
service,
(ii)
in setting a rate to be charged for the particular service provided,
consider each distinct class of service as a self contained unit, and

set a rate for each unit that it considers to be just and reasonable
for that unit, without regard to the rates set for any other unit.
(2)
In setting a rate under this Act, the commission may take into account
a distinct or special area served by a public utility with a view to
ensuring, so far as the commission considers it advisable, that the
rate applicable in each area is adequate to yield a fair and
reasonable return on the appraised value of the plant or system of the
public utility used, or prudently and reasonably acquired, for the
purpose of providing the service in that special area.

If the commission takes a special area into account under subsection
(2), it must have regard to the special considerations applicable to
an area that is sparsely settled or has other distinctive
characteristics.

of the property of the public utility any franchise, licence, permit

licence, permit or concession, together with necessary and reasonable
expenses in procuring the franchise, licence, permit or concession.

without the commission's consent.

Act and the regulations are the only lawful, enforceable and
collectable rates of the public utility filing them, and no other rate
may be collected, charged or enforced.
(4)
A public utility may file with the commission a new schedule of rates
that the utility considers to be made necessary by a change in the
price, over which the utility has no effective control, required to be
paid by the public utility for its gas supplies, other energy supplied
to it, or expenses and taxes, and the new schedule may be put into
effect by the public utility on receiving the approval of the
commission.
(5)
Within 60 days after the date it approves a new schedule under
subsection (4), the commission may,
(a)
on complaint of a person whose interests are affected, or
(b)
on its own motion,
direct an inquiry into the new schedule of rates having regard to the
setting of a rate that is not unjust or unreasonable.
(6)
After an inquiry under subsection (5), the commission may
(a)
rescind or vary the increase and order a refund or customer credit by
the utility of all or part of the money received by way of increase,
or

than that specified in the subsisting schedules of the utility
applicable to that service and filed under this Act.
Orders respecting contracts
64
(1)

entered into by a public utility a person receives a regulated service
at rates that are unduly preferential or discriminatory, the
commission may
(a)
declare the contract unenforceable, either wholly or to the extent the
commission considers proper, and the contract is then unenforceable to
the extent specified, or
(b)
make any other order it considers advisable in the circumstances.

If a contract is declared unenforceable either wholly or in part, the
commission may order that rights accrued before the date of the order
