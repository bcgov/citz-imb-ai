of a parent or child of the trustee is, if known to the trustee,
deemed to be also the pecuniary interest of the trustee.
Duty of trustee
58
(1)
If a trustee has any pecuniary interest in any matter and is present
at a meeting of the board at which the matter is considered, the
trustee
(a)
must at the meeting disclose the trustee's pecuniary interest and the
general nature of the pecuniary interest,
(b)
must not take part in the discussion of or vote on any question in
respect of the matter, and
(c)
must not attempt in any way, whether before, during or after the
meeting, to influence the voting on any question in respect of the
matter.
(2)
If the meeting referred to in subsection (1) is not open to the
public, in addition to complying with the requirements of that
subsection the trustee must immediately leave the meeting or the part
of the meeting during which the matter is under consideration.
(3)
If the pecuniary interest of a trustee is not disclosed as required by
subsection (1) by reason of the trustee's absence from the meeting,
the trustee must disclose the pecuniary interest and otherwise comply
with the requirements of that subsection at the first meeting of the
board attended by the trustee after the meeting referred to in that
subsection.
Exceptions
59
Section 58 does not apply to a pecuniary interest in any matter that a
trustee may have
(a)
by reason of the trustee having a pecuniary interest in the matter
which is a pecuniary interest in common with electors generally,
(b)
by reason of the trustee being entitled to receive any indemnity,
expenses or remuneration payable to one or more trustees in respect of
the matter,
(c)
by reason only that the trustee is a member of an association
incorporated under the
Cooperative Association Act
or a credit union having dealings or contracts in respect of the
matter with the board of the school district of which the trustee is a
trustee, or
(d)
by reason only of a pecuniary interest of the trustee that is so
remote or insignificant in its nature that it cannot reasonably be
regarded as likely to influence the trustee.
Record of disclosure
60
(1)
If a meeting is open to the public, every disclosure of pecuniary
interest and the general nature of it made under section 58 must
be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.
(2)
If a meeting is not open to the public, the fact that a disclosure of
pecuniary interest was made under section 58, but not the general
nature of that interest, must be recorded in the minutes of the next
meeting that is open to the public.
Remedy for lack of quorum
61
(1)
When the number of trustees who, because of this Part, are
disqualified from participating in a meeting is such that at that
meeting the remaining trustees are not of sufficient number to
constitute a quorum, the board may apply to the court without notice
to any person for an order authorizing the board to give consideration
to, discuss and vote on the matter out of which the pecuniary interest
arises.
(2)
The court, on application under subsection (1) and after giving any
direction as to service considered appropriate, may declare that
section 58 does not apply to the board in respect of the matter in
relation to which the application is brought, and the board may then
give consideration to, discuss and vote on the matter in the same
manner as though none of the trustees had any pecuniary interest in
the matter, subject only to the conditions and directions that the
judge may consider appropriate and so order.
Application to court
62
(1)
Subject to subsection (3) an elector may, within 6 weeks after the
fact comes to the elector's knowledge that a trustee may have
contravened section 58, apply to the court for a determination of the
question of whether the trustee has contravened section 58.
(2)
The elector in the application must state the grounds for alleging a
contravention of section 58 by the trustee.
(3)
No application may be brought under subsection (1) after the
expiration of 4 years from the time at which the contravention is
alleged to have occurred.
Remedy
63
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), if the court determines that a person,
while holding the office of trustee, has knowingly contravened
section 58, the court
(a)
must, in the case of a person currently holding office as a trustee,
declare the office of the trustee vacant, and
(b)
may, if the contravention has resulted in financial gain, require the
person to make restitution to the party suffering the loss or, if that
party is not readily ascertainable, to the board of which the person
is a trustee or former trustee.
(2)
If the court determines that a person who is currently holding an
office of trustee contravened section 58 and finds that the
contravention was committed through inadvertence or because of an
error in judgment made in good faith, the person is not subject to
having the person's office declared vacant under subsection (1).
(3)
An office declared vacant under subsection (1) must remain vacant if
the decision is appealed, and no election to fill the office may be
held until the final determination of the matter or until the next
general school election, whichever is earlier.
Proceedings voidable
64
(1)
The failure of any person to comply with the requirements of
section 58 does not of itself invalidate any proceedings of the
board, but the proceedings are voidable at the instance of the board
before the expiration of 2 years from the date of the passing of
the resolution or bylaw in respect of which the failure occurred.
(2)
Subsection (1) applies unless to invalidate the proceedings would
adversely affect the rights of another person who acquired those
rights under or as a result of the proceedings and who acted in good
faith and without actual notice of the failure to comply with
section 58.
