(a)
no collective agreement is in force, and 12 months have elapsed since

the bargaining agent for the employees may, by written notice, require
the government to begin collective bargaining, or

the bargaining agent for the government may, by written notice,
require the bargaining agent for the employees to begin collective
bargaining in respect of the employees in the bargaining unit.

collective agreement or concluding a new collective agreement.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), if a collective agreement provides for a
period of notice to begin collective bargaining that is longer or
shorter than that required under subsection (1), that provision of the
collective agreement has effect and is deemed to be notice under this
Act.
(3)
If a party to the collective agreement gives notice under subsection
(1), the parties must, without delay and in any case within 14 clear
days after the notice was given or a further period the parties agree
on, meet and begin to bargain collectively with one another and make
every reasonable effort to conclude a renewal or revision of the
collective agreement or a new collective agreement.
(4)
If notice is not given under subsection (1) by either party
60 days or more before the date of expiry or termination of the
collective agreement, both parties are deemed to have been given
notice under this section 60 days before the date of expiry or
termination, and then subsection (3) applies.

determined by negotiation between the parties.
Exclusions from collective agreement
11
(1)
A collective agreement concluded under section 8 or 9 may exclude from
its application certain employees or classes of employees.
(2)
Employees or classes of employees to be excluded from the collective
agreement may be determined by negotiation between the parties, but if
the parties are unable to agree, either party may refer the matter to
the board for a final and binding decision.
(3)
In making its decision under subsection (2), the board must exclude
those employees or classes of employees who are employed
(a)
to exercise the functions, and do exercise the functions, of a manager
or superintendent in the direction or control of employees,

Union security

persons in the bargaining unit who are employees on the date the union
is certified as bargaining agent for that bargaining unit, provide
that the government must do the following:
(a)
deduct from the monthly wages or salary of each employee in the
bargaining unit affected by the collective agreement, whether or not
the employee is a member of the union, the amount of the regular
monthly dues payable to the union by a member of the union;
(b)
remit monthly to the union the amounts deducted under paragraph (a);
(c)
inform the union monthly, or otherwise as provided in the collective
agreement, of the names of the employees from whose monthly wages or
salary deductions have been made in the preceding month and the amount
deducted.
(2)
This Act must not be construed as requiring a person who is an
employee before the date the union is certified as bargaining agent to
become a member of that union, but it is a condition of employment
that a person who becomes an employee after a bargaining agent has
been certified for the appropriate bargaining unit of that employee
must become and remain a member of that union on completing
30 days as an employee.
(3)
Any arrangement for deduction of dues between the government and a
