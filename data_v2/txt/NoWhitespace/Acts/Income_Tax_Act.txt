country other than Canada, the portion is deemed to be income from a
separate source in the particular country, and

deducted under that section for the individual's taxation year that
begins on January 1 of the calendar year that includes the date of
bankruptcy.
(8)
The amounts expressed in dollars in the descriptions of "EAI" in
subsection (2) must be adjusted so that, if the base taxation year in
relation to a particular month is after 2019, the amount to be used
under that subsection for the month is the total of
(a)
the amount that would, but for subsection (9), be the relevant amount
used under subsection (2) for the month that is one year before the
particular month, and
(b)
the product obtained by multiplying
(i)
the amount referred to in paragraph (a)
by
(ii)
the amount, adjusted in the prescribed manner and rounded to the
nearest one-thousandth or, if the result obtained is equidistant from
2 consecutive one-thousandths, to the higher one-thousandth, that is
determined by the following formula:
A
− 1
B
where
A
=
is the Consumer Price Index for British Columbia, within the
meaning of section 4.52 (7), for the 12-month period that ended
on September 30 of the base taxation year, and

the government of a country other than Canada includes the government
of a state, province or other political subdivision of that country,
(b)
if a corporation's income for a taxation year is in whole or in part
from sources in more than one country other than Canada, subsection
(3.1) must be read as providing for separate deductions in respect of
each of the countries other than Canada, and
(c)
if any income from a source in a particular country would be
tax-exempt income but for the fact that a portion of the income is
subject to an income or profits tax imposed by the government of a
country other than Canada, the portion is deemed to be income from a
separate source in the particular country.
(5.1)
In subsection (5.2),
"deduction calculation change"
means any amendment to this Act that effects a change to the
percentage referred to in the formula in subsection (3.1) (a).
(5.2)
If, during the taxation year of a corporation, there are one or more
deduction calculation changes, the corporation must determine the
amounts under subsection (3.1) for that taxation year as if the
percentage referred to in the formula in subsection (3.1) (a) were the
percentage determined in accordance with the following:
(a)
the corporation must divide its taxation year into notional taxation
years as follows:
(i)
the first of those notional taxation years begins on the first day of
the corporation's taxation year and ends on the day before the day on
which the first deduction calculation change that occurs in its
taxation year takes effect;
(ii)
subject to subparagraph (iii), a notional taxation year will begin on
each day in the corporation's taxation year on which a deduction
calculation change takes effect and will end on the day before the day
in its taxation year on which the next deduction calculation change
takes effect;
(iii)
the last notional taxation year begins on the day on which the last
deduction calculation change that occurs in the corporation's taxation
year takes effect and ends on the last day of its taxation year;
(b)
the corporation must, for each notional taxation year within the
corporation's taxation year,
(i)
multiply the percentage referred to in the formula in subsection (3.1)
(a), as that subsection read on the first day of that notional
taxation year, by the fraction obtained by dividing the number of days
in that notional taxation year by the number of days in the
corporation's taxation year, and
(ii)
round the result to the nearest one-thousandth of one percent or, if
the result obtained is equidistant from 2 consecutive one-thousandths,
to the higher one-thousandth;
(c)
the corporation must add to the percentage determined under paragraph
(b) for the first notional taxation year within the corporation's
taxation year the percentage determined under paragraph (b) for each
of the other notional taxation years within its taxation year;
(d)
the total percentage determined under paragraph (c) is the percentage
to be used in the formula in subsection (3.1) (a) in respect of the
corporation's taxation year.
(6)
If an amount is to be refunded to a corporation in respect of a
taxation year, under section 131 of the federal Act, the minister
must, subject to subsection (7), at the time and in the manner
provided in that section, refund to the corporation an amount, in this
section referred to as its "capital gains refund" for the year, equal
to that proportion of the amount of the refund for the year calculated
under section 131 (2) of the federal Act that
(a)
the percentage referred to in subsection (2) for the year
is of
(b)
the percentage referred to in paragraph (a) of the description of "A"
in the definition of "refundable capital gains tax on hand" in section
131 (6) of the federal Act for the year.
(7)
To calculate the capital gains refund under subsection (6) for a
corporation in respect of a taxation year, if
(a)
the corporation's taxable income earned in the year in British
Columbia
is less than
(b)
the corporation's taxable income for the year,
the refund is that proportion of the capital gains refund for the
year, otherwise determined under subsection (6), that the amount
determined under paragraph (a) is of the amount determined under
paragraph (b).
(8)
Instead of making a refund that might otherwise be made under
subsection (6), the minister may, if the corporation is liable or
about to become liable to make any payment under this Act, apply the
amount that would otherwise be refunded to that other liability and
notify the corporation of that action.

section;

(2)
If a transaction is an avoidance transaction, the tax consequences to

circumstances in order to deny a BC tax benefit that, but for this
section, would result, directly or indirectly, from that transaction
or from a series of transactions that includes that transaction.
(2.1)
Subsection (2) applies to a transaction only if the transaction may
reasonably be considered to be a transaction that

the nature of any payment or other amount may be recharacterized, and
(d)
the tax effects that would otherwise result from the application of
other provisions of this Act or the regulations may be ignored,
in determining the tax consequences to a person in a manner that is
reasonable in the circumstances in order to deny a tax benefit that
would, but for this section, result, directly or indirectly, from an
avoidance transaction.
(3.1)
Despite any other provision of this Act, if an amount under this Act
is adjusted under this section by reason of a determination under
subsection (2) of the tax consequences of a transaction to a person,
and the amount would have been, but for that adjustment, an amount
determined under the federal Act, the amount determined under the
federal Act is deemed to have been adjusted to the same extent for the
purposes of this Act.

reflecting the application of subsection (2) to a transaction has been
sent to a person, or a notice of determination under section 29 or 30

days after the date of the sending of that notice, to request in
writing that the minister make an assessment, reassessment or
additional assessment applying subsection (2) of this section or make
a determination applying section 29 or 30 with respect to the
transaction.

section 29 or 30, except that an assessment, reassessment or
additional assessment or determination may be made under this
subsection only to the extent that it may be reasonably regarded as
relating to a transaction referred to in subsection (4) of this
section.
(6)
The tax consequences to any person, after the application of this
section, must only be determined through
(a)
a notice of assessment, reassessment or additional assessment under
section 29 or 30, or
(b)
a notice of determination under section 29 or 30 or Part 13
[Natural Gas Tax Credit]

for the taxation year to the extent of the amount deducted or withheld
on account of the individual's income tax for that year under the law
of that non-agreeing province.
(7)
If an adjusting payment to a non-agreeing province is to be made under
this section for a taxation year, the total amount deducted or
withheld on account of tax payable under this Act and on account of
the income tax payable under the law of the non-agreeing province by
an individual resident in British Columbia on the last day of the
taxation year to whom subsection (6) applies exceeds the tax payable
by the individual under this Act for that year, section 40 of this Act
applies to the individual as though the excess were an overpayment
under this Act.
(8)
If a collection agreement is entered into and the government of Canada
has agreed in respect of a taxation year to carry out the direction of
British Columbia and to make an adjusting payment on behalf of British
Columbia, the adjusting payment
