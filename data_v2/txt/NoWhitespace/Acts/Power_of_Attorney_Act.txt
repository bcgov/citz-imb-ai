This Part does not apply to an enduring power of attorney under Part
2.

Sections 3 and 4 do not apply to agency relationships that
(a)
are created by section 7 of the
Partnership Act
, or
(b)
arise under common law out of the relationship of partners to a firm
and to each other.
(2)

authority of an agent, that person is deemed to have knowledge of the
termination of the authority.
Liability of agent
3

the agent's authority to do so has been terminated and
(a)
the act is within the scope of the agent's former authority, and
(b)
the agent has no knowledge of the termination,
then, for the purpose of determining the liability of the agent for
the act, the agent is deemed to have had the authority to so act.
Effect of termination
4
(1)
If
(a)
the authority of an agent has been terminated, and
(b)
a person who has no knowledge of the termination purports to deal with
the principal through the agent,
then, for the purpose of determining the legal rights and obligations
of the principal in relation to that person, the transaction is, in
favour of that person, deemed to be as valid as if the authority had
existed.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), if the principal has
(a)
by express revocation terminated the authority of an agent, and
(b)
given notice of the termination to the agent,
the liability of the principal to any person for the subsequent acts
of the agent must be determined without regard to this Act.

has been terminated, but
(a)
the agent purporting to act for the principal enters into a
transaction with a person (called in this section "the intermediate

the rights of another person (called in this section "the stranger")
are dependent on the validity of the transaction entered into by the
agent with the intermediate party, and
(c)
the stranger had, at the material time, no knowledge of the
termination of the authority of the agent,
then, for the purpose of determining the legal rights and obligations
of the principal in relation to the stranger, the intermediate party
is conclusively deemed to have had no knowledge of the termination.
Representation grant issued to attorney
5
If a representation grant, within the meaning of the
Wills, Estates and Succession Act
, has been issued to a person as attorney for some other person,

attorney of which that other person was the donor.

A corporation within the legislative jurisdiction of the Legislature
may, by instrument in writing under its corporate seal, empower a

the corporation and of the same effect as if it had been executed by
the corporation.

behalf of a donor, whether an individual or corporation,
