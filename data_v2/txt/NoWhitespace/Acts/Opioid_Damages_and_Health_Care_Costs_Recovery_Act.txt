In an action under section 2 (1) or 2.1 (1) for the recovery of the
cost of health care benefits on an aggregate basis, subsection (2) of
this section applies if the government, or the government of Canada,
as the case may be, proves, on a balance of probabilities, that, in

(b) may be reduced, or the proportions of liability assessed under

use or exposure referred to in subsection (2) (a) or to the disease,
injury or illness or risk of disease, injury or illness referred to in
subsectionÂ (2)Â (b).

one or more defendants causes or contributes to a risk of disease,
injury or illness by making a type of opioid product available to
insured persons, and

illness as a result of the use or exposure,

to the type of opioid product;
(j)
the extent to which a defendant continued promoting the type of opioid

health needs of the population of insured persons who were likely to
use or be exposed to the type of opioid product;
