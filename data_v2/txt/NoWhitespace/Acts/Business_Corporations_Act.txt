return of capital, are not paid in full, the shares of all series of
shares of the same class of shares must, in a return of capital in

Division 9 — Debentures
Validity of perpetual debenture
102
Despite any rule of equity to the contrary, no condition contained in

happening of a contingency, however remote, or on the expiration of a
period, however long.

(a)
an express or implied provision to the contrary is contained in the
debenture, the articles or a contract entered into by the company, or

intention that the debenture be cancelled.

debenture, particulars of that debenture must be included in the
balance sheet of the company.
(4)
If a company has issued or deposited a debenture created by the
company to secure advances on current account or otherwise, the
debenture is not deemed to have been redeemed merely because any of
the advances are repaid, or the account of the company ceases to be in
debit, while the debenture remains issued or deposited.
(5)
The reissue of a debenture or the issue of another debenture in its
place under this section is deemed not to be the issue of a new
debenture for the purpose of a provision limiting the amount or number
of debentures to be issued.

notice of the application for leave has been given to the company and
to any other person the court may order,

(5)
No legal proceeding prosecuted or defended under this section may be
discontinued, settled or dismissed without the approval of the court.
(6)
No application made or legal proceeding prosecuted or defended under
section 232 or this section may be stayed or dismissed merely because
it is shown that an alleged breach of a right, duty or obligation owed
to the company has been or might be approved by the shareholders of
the company, but evidence of that approval or possible approval may be
taken into account by the court in making an order under section 232
or this section.
Relief in legal proceedings
234
If, in a legal proceeding against a director, officer, receiver,
receiver manager or liquidator of a company, the court finds that that
person is or may be liable in respect of negligence, default, breach
of duty or breach of trust, the court must take into consideration all
of the circumstances of the case, including those circumstances
connected with the person's election or appointment, and may relieve
the person, either wholly or partly, from liability, on the terms the
court considers necessary, if it appears to the court that, despite
the finding of liability, the person has acted honestly and reasonably
and ought fairly to be excused.

served on those persons the court requires.
Court may order security for costs
236
If a corporation is the plaintiff in a legal proceeding brought before
the court, and if it appears that the corporation will be unable to
pay the costs of the defendant if the defendant is successful in the
defence, the court may require security to be given by the corporation
for those costs, and may stay all legal proceedings until the security
is given.
