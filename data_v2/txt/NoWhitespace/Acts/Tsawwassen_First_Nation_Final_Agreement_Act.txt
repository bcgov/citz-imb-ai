Legislation include a provision that, to the extent that a Provincial
Law does not apply of its own force to Tsawwassen First Nation,
Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Lands, Tsawwassen Government, Tsawwassen

23. Despite any other rule of priority in this Agreement, a Federal Law

rights, the protection of the health and safety of all Canadians, or
other matters of overriding national importance, prevails to the extent
of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law.
24. Despite any other rule of priority in this Agreement, Federal and
Provincial Law prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen
Law that has an incidental impact on a subject matter for which
Tsawwassen Government:
a. has no power to make laws; or
b. has the power to make laws but in respect of which Federal and
Provincial Laws prevail in the event of a Conflict.
25. Despite any other rule of priority in this Agreement, Federal and

jurisdiction for which Tsawwassen Government:
a. has no power to make laws; or
b. has the power to make laws but in respect of which Federal and
Provincial Laws prevail in the event of a Conflict.
RELATIONSHIP OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FEDERAL LAW, PROVINCIAL LAW AND
TSAWWASSEN LAW

force or effect to the extent of the inconsistency.

Federal or Provincial Law.

the extent of a Conflict, and Provincial Settlement Legislation prevails
over other Provincial Law to the extent of a Conflict.
29. A licence, permit or other authorization, to be issued by Canada or
British Columbia as a result of this Agreement, will be issued under
Federal or Provincial Law, as the case may be, and will not form part of
this Agreement, and this Agreement prevails to the extent of any
inconsistency with the licence, permit or other authorization.
INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS
30. After the Effective Date, before consenting to be bound by a new
International Treaty that would give rise to a new International Legal
Obligation that may adversely affect a right of Tsawwassen First Nation
under this Agreement, Canada will Consult with Tsawwassen First Nation
in respect of the International Treaty, either separately or through a
forum that Canada determines is appropriate.
31. Where Canada informs Tsawwassen First Nation that it considers that
a Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen First Nation
causes Canada to be unable to perform an International Legal Obligation,
Tsawwassen First Nation and Canada will discuss remedial measures to
enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation. Subject to
clause 32, Tsawwassen First Nation will remedy the Tsawwassen Law or
other exercise of power to the extent necessary to enable Canada to
perform the International Legal Obligation.
32. Where Canada and Tsawwassen First Nation disagree over whether a
Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen First Nation
causes Canada to be unable to perform an International Legal Obligation,
the dispute will be resolved under the Dispute Resolution chapter of
this Agreement, including the arbitration provisions, and:
a. if the arbitrator, having taken into account all relevant
considerations, including any reservations and exceptions taken by
Canada, determines that the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by
Tsawwassen First Nation does not cause Canada to be unable to perform
the International Legal Obligation, or that the remedial measures are
sufficient to enable Canada to perform the International Legal
Obligation, Canada will not take any further action for this reason
aimed at changing the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power; or
b. if the arbitrator, having taken into account all relevant
considerations including any reservations and exceptions available to
Canada, determines that the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power
causes Canada to be unable to perform the International Legal
Obligation, or that the remedial measures are insufficient to enable
Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation, Tsawwassen First
Nation will remedy the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power to the
extent necessary to enable Canada to perform the International Legal
Obligation.
33. Canada will Consult with Tsawwassen First Nation in respect of the
development of positions taken by Canada before an International
Tribunal where a Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen
First Nation has given rise to an issue concerning the performance of an
International Legal Obligation of Canada. Canada's positions before the
International Tribunal will take into account the commitment of the
Parties to the integrity of this Agreement.
34. Despite clause 32, if there is a finding of an International
Tribunal of non-performance of an International Legal Obligation of
Canada attributable to a Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by
Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen First Nation will, at the request of
Canada, remedy the Tsawwassen Law or action to enable Canada to perform
the International Legal Obligation consistent with the compliance of
Canada, including Federal or Provincial Law, as applicable, in respect
of that International Legal Obligation.

Financing Agreement or other funding agreement.
38. Nothing in this Agreement affects the ability of Tsawwassen First
Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Government, Tsawwassen Public
Institutions or Tsawwassen Corporations to apply for or bid on any
commercial, economic or other activity or project for which they would
otherwise be eligible.
39. Subject to the Transition chapter and clause 16 of the Taxation
chapter, the
Indian Act

Tsawwassen Government or Tsawwassen Public Institutions, except for the
purpose of determining whether an individual is an "Indian" within the
meaning of the
Indian Act
.
40. Subject to clause 5 of the Transition chapter, the Framework
Agreement on First Nation Land Management, the
First Nations Land Management Act
and the Tsawwassen First Nation Land Code have no application to

41. For so long as the
First Nations Land Management Act
is in force, Canada will indemnify Tsawwassen First Nation, in respect

d. as may be required under the common law in relation to an
infringement of that right.

obligation to consult except as set out in subclause 45.a, 45.b or 45.c.

resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution chapter.

Other Tsawwassen Lands in accordance with clause 20, Tsawwassen First
Nation may set fees, rents, royalties or charges other than taxes,
related to the exploration, development, extraction or production of

Subsurface Resources from Tsawwassen Lands or Other Tsawwassen Lands, as
applicable.

.
34. In respect of Tsawwassen Lands and the Former Tsawwassen Reserve

ADDITION TO OR REMOVAL FROM TSAWWASSEN LANDS
36. Tsawwassen First Nation may add lands that it owns in fee simple to
Tsawwassen Lands, in accordance with clauses 37 through 49, no more
often than once every five years.

or
b. British Columbia and Tsawwassen First Nation agree.

Specified Lands will become Tsawwassen Lands after completion of the
process set out in clauses 43 and 44.
43. Before the addition of any parcel of Specified Lands to Tsawwassen
Lands, Tsawwassen First Nation will:
a. hold discussions with any resident of, or interest holder in, the

will consider a request by Tsawwassen First Nation to add land,
including any parcel of the Specified Lands, to Tsawwassen Lands if:
a. Tsawwassen First Nation owns the land in fee simple;
b. the land is within Tsawwassen Territory; and
c. the land is:
i. outside municipal boundaries and a change in jurisdiction to that
land will not unreasonably restrict the expansion or development of a
municipality; or
ii. inside municipal boundaries and the municipality consents.
46. In addition to the matters set out in clause 45, British Columbia
will take into account among other factors:
a. whether the land is contiguous to existing Tsawwassen Lands; and
b. the interests of a regional district in cases where the land is
within a regional district but not within a municipality.
47. After the 50-year period referred to in clause 42, Canada will

a. Tsawwassen First Nation owns the lands in fee simple;
b. the lands are within Tsawwassen Territory; and
c. the lands are:
i. free from any overlapping aboriginal claim; or
ii. subject to an overlapping aboriginal claim and the claimant

48. In considering whether to consent to a request referred to in clause

b. British Columbia owns the Highway 17 Corridor except for Subsurface
Resources which are owned by Tsawwassen First Nation;
c. British Columbia owns the Highway 17 Corridor for use for provincial

d. Tsawwassen First Nation may use the Subsurface Resources if that use

public highway purposes and works of Public Utility.
53. If British Columbia no longer requires any portion of the Highway 17
Corridor for provincial public highway purposes:
a. at the request of Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen First Nation
will take ownership of that portion in fee simple, at no cost to
Tsawwassen First Nation;

the Highway 17 Corridor.
DELTAPORT WAY CORRIDOR
57. British Columbia or Canada, as applicable, will Consult with
Tsawwassen First Nation before authorizing new works within the
Deltaport Way Corridor.
FEDERAL EXPROPRIATION
58. Canada acknowledges the interest of Tsawwassen First Nation in
maintaining the size and integrity of Tsawwassen Lands and agrees that,
as a general principle, federal expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands will
be avoided where reasonably practicable, except as set out in this
chapter.
59. Where the fee simple interest in a parcel of land in the Former
Tsawwassen Reserve is held by Tsawwassen First Nation, a Tsawwassen
Member, a Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution, no
interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal Expropriating
Authority.
60. Despite clause 58, where the fee simple interest in a parcel of
Tsawwassen Lands, including the Former Tsawwassen Reserve, is held by a
Person other than Tsawwassen First Nation, a Tsawwassen Member, a
Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution, this chapter
does not apply to the expropriation of any interest in that parcel and,
for greater certainty, any such interest may be expropriated under
federal legislation.
61. Despite clause 58, but subject to clause 59, where the fee simple
interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is held by Tsawwassen First
Nation, any interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal
Expropriating Authority in accordance with this chapter, federal
legislation, and with the consent of the Governor in Council.
62. Despite clause 58, but subject to clause 59, where the fee simple
interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is held by a Tsawwassen Member,
a Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution, any
interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal Expropriating
Authority in accordance with federal legislation, and with the consent
of the Governor in Council, and in accordance with clauses 63 through
68, clause 76, clause 77, and clauses 79 through 86, which apply with
such modifications as the circumstances require to reflect that the
interest is held by a Tsawwassen Member, a Tsawwassen Corporation or a
Tsawwassen Public Institution, as the case may be, except that any
return of land under clauses 79 through 82 will be to Tsawwassen First
Nation.
63. The Governor in Council may consent to an expropriation of an
interest in Tsawwassen Lands only if the expropriation is justifiable in
accordance with clause 64 and necessary for a public purpose.
64. For the purposes of clause 63, an expropriation is justifiable where
the Governor in Council is satisfied that the following requirements
have been met:
a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative land to acquire
that is not Tsawwassen Lands;
b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Federal Expropriating
Authority to acquire the interest in Tsawwassen Lands through agreement
with Tsawwassen First Nation;
c. the most limited interest in Tsawwassen Lands necessary for the
purpose for which the interest in land is sought is expropriated and for
the shortest time possible; and
d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that
would be protected from disclosure under federal legislation, has been
provided to Tsawwassen First Nation.
65. Before the Governor in Council consents to the expropriation of an
interest in Tsawwassen Lands, the Federal Expropriating Authority will
provide to Tsawwassen First Nation, and make available to the public, a
report stating the justification for the expropriation and describing
the steps taken to satisfy the requirements set out in clause 64.
66. If Tsawwassen First Nation objects to a proposed expropriation of an
interest in Tsawwassen Lands, it may, within 60 days after the report
has been provided to Tsawwassen First Nation in accordance with clause
65, by providing notice in writing to the Federal Expropriating
Authority, refer the matter for review of the steps taken to satisfy the
requirements set out in clause 64 directly to neutral evaluation under
Stage Two of the Dispute Resolution chapter.
67. The Federal Expropriating Authority may not seek Governor in Council
consent to the expropriation of an interest in Tsawwassen Lands before
the expiration of the period referred to in clause 66 or, if Tsawwassen
First Nation has referred the matter to a neutral evaluator in
accordance with clause 66, before the neutral evaluator has reported on
the matter, such report to be rendered to Tsawwassen First Nation and
the Federal Expropriating Authority within 60 days of the referral being
made, or within such additional time period as they may agree.
68. Without limiting the generality of the Dispute Resolution chapter,
the opinion of the neutral evaluator under clause 66:
a. is without prejudice to the legal positions that may be taken by a
Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen First Nation in court or
in any other forum;
b. will not be admissible in any legal proceedings, unless otherwise
required by law; and
c. is not binding on the Governor in Council under clauses 63 and 64.
69. Where a fee simple interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is
expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority, the Federal
Expropriating Authority will make reasonable efforts:
a. to identify replacement land within Tsawwassen Territory, being
either Crown land or land available on a willing-seller willing-buyer
basis, of equivalent or greater size and comparable value; and
b. if the replacement land is acceptable to Tsawwassen First Nation, to
acquire and offer the replacement land to Tsawwassen First Nation as
partial or full compensation for the expropriation.
If the Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen First Nation are
unable to agree on the provision of replacement land as compensation,
the Federal Expropriating Authority will provide Tsawwassen First Nation
with other compensation in accordance with this Agreement.
70. Subject to clause 73, if the replacement land identified by the
Federal Expropriating Authority would result in the total size of
Tsawwassen Lands being less than as at the Effective Date and Tsawwassen
First Nation does not agree that the replacement land is of comparable
value to the interest in Tsawwassen Lands being expropriated, then
Tsawwassen First Nation may refer the issue of whether the replacement
land is of comparable value to the interest in Tsawwassen Lands being
expropriated to be finally determined by arbitration under the Dispute
Resolution chapter.
71. The total value of compensation for an interest in Tsawwassen Lands
expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority under this chapter
will be determined by taking into account the following factors:
a. the market value of the expropriated interest or of the Tsawwassen
Lands in which an interest has been expropriated;
b. the replacement value of any improvement to Tsawwassen Lands in which
an interest has been expropriated;
c. any expenses or losses resulting from a disturbance directly
attributable to the expropriation;
d. any reduction in the value of any interest in Tsawwassen Lands that
is not expropriated which directly relates to the expropriation;
e. any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of
Tsawwassen Lands in which an interest has been expropriated to
Tsawwassen First Nation, provided that the cultural or other special
value is only applied to an interest in Tsawwassen Lands recognized in
law and held by Tsawwassen First Nation, and provided that there will be
no increase in the total value of compensation on account of any Section
35 Rights of Tsawwassen First Nation; and
f. the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or
incidental to the occupation or use of Tsawwassen Lands by Tsawwassen
First Nation to the extent that the value is not otherwise compensated.
72. Subject to clause 73, if the total value of compensation cannot be
agreed upon between the Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen
First Nation, or where there is disagreement on whether the combination
of replacement land and cash is equal to the total value of
compensation, either the Federal Expropriating Authority or Tsawwassen
First Nation may refer the issue of the total value of compensation for
dispute resolution under the Dispute Resolution chapter.
73. A dispute on the valuation of replacement land under clause 70, or
on the total value of compensation under clause 72, or on the terms and
conditions of the return of land under clause 82 will not delay the
expropriation.
74. Any claim or encumbrance in respect of the interest expropriated may
only be claimed against the amount of compensation that is otherwise
payable under clause 71.
75. Interest on compensation is payable from the date the expropriation
takes effect, at the prejudgment interest rate payable in accordance
with federal legislation.
76. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates a fee simple
interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands, that parcel will no longer be
Tsawwassen Lands.
77. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates less than a fee
simple interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands:
a. the parcel retains its status as Tsawwassen Lands;
b. the parcel remains subject to Tsawwassen Laws, except to the extent
that such laws are inconsistent with the use of the parcel of land for
which the expropriation took place; and
c. Tsawwassen First Nation or any interest holder may continue to use
and occupy the parcel, except to the extent that the use or occupation
is inconsistent with the use of the parcel for which the expropriation
took place in the view of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
78. Canada and British Columbia will consent to replacement land,
transferred by a Federal Expropriating Authority to Tsawwassen First
Nation as part of the compensation in accordance with clause 69, being
added to Tsawwassen Lands if:
a. the replacement land is within Tsawwassen Territory;
b. the replacement land is outside municipal boundaries and a change in
jurisdiction to that land will not unreasonably restrict the expansion
or development of a municipality, or the replacement land is inside
municipal boundaries if the municipality consents;
c. the replacement land is free from any overlapping aboriginal claim
unless the claimant consents; and
d. the addition of replacement land to Tsawwassen Lands will not result
in Canada or British Columbia being required to assume financial or
other obligations.
79. Where an expropriated interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is no
longer required for the purpose for which it was expropriated, the
federal department, agency or entity, or its successor or assigns, will
ensure that the interest in land is returned to Tsawwassen First Nation
on the terms and conditions negotiated in accordance with clause 81.
Subject to clause 78, where a fee simple interest in a parcel of land is
returned to Tsawwassen First Nation in accordance with this clause, the
parcel of land will become Tsawwassen Lands on the date of the transfer.
80. The Minister responsible for the federal department, agency or other
entity, or its successors or assigns, who holds the expropriated
interest, without the consent of the Governor in Council, may decide
that the expropriated interest is no longer required and may determine
the disposition of any improvements.
81. The terms and conditions of the return of an expropriated interest
in Tsawwassen Lands, including requirements relating to financial
considerations based on market value principles, the condition of the
land to be returned, and the process for resolving disputes on the
implementation of the terms and conditions, will be negotiated by
Tsawwassen First Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority at the
time of the expropriation.
82. Subject to clause 73, where the terms and conditions of the return
of an expropriated interest in Tsawwassen Lands cannot be agreed upon by
Tsawwassen First Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority at the
time of the expropriation, either Tsawwassen First Nation or the Federal
Expropriating Authority may refer the issue to be finally determined by
arbitration under the Dispute Resolution chapter.
83. Except as otherwise provided in clauses 58 through 86, no conflict
or dispute between the Parties in respect of the interpretation,
application or implementation of these clauses will go to dispute
resolution under the Dispute Resolution chapter.
84. For greater certainty, and subject to clause 85, except to the
extent that the provisions of this chapter modify the application of
federal legislation relating to an expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands,
all federal legislation relating to expropriation applies to an
expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands under this chapter.
85. Without limiting the generality of clause 27 of the General
Provisions chapter, this Agreement prevails to the extent of an
inconsistency with the federal
Expropriation Act
or other federal legislation relating to an expropriation of Tsawwassen
Lands.
86. Nothing in this Agreement affects or limits the application of the
Emergencies Act
(Canada), or any successor legislation, and the
Emergencies Act
(Canada) continues to apply in all aspects to Tsawwassen Lands.
PROVINCIAL EXPROPRIATION
87. British Columbia acknowledges as a general principle that where it
is reasonable to use other means, expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands and
Other Tsawwassen Lands will be avoided.
88. Expropriations of Tsawwassen Lands by Provincial Expropriating
Authorities in total, over time, will not exceed three per cent of the
amount of Tsawwassen Lands as at the Effective Date.
89. For greater certainty, Provincial Law in respect of expropriation
applies to Other Tsawwassen Lands and to additions to Tsawwassen Lands.
90. Subject to this chapter, any expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands by
and for the use of a Provincial Expropriating Authority will be carried
out in accordance with applicable provincial legislation and processes.
91. Where a Provincial Expropriating Authority has determined that it
must use Tsawwassen Lands:
a. it will make reasonable efforts to acquire the land through agreement
with Tsawwassen First Nation and any interest holder; and
b. it will provide to Tsawwassen First Nation and any interest holder
information relevant to the acquisition or expropriation.
92. Any expropriation of Tsawwassen Lands by a Provincial Expropriating
Authority will be:
a. of the smallest estate or interest necessary, and for the shortest
time required;
b. by and for the use of a provincial ministry or agent of the
provincial Crown, or for the use of a Public Utility whether or not an
agent of the Crown, who would otherwise have the authority to
expropriate land under provincial legislation, or on whose behalf
British Columbia may expropriate;
c. necessary for a public purpose; and
d. with the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.
93. The total value of the compensation provided by the Provincial
Expropriating Authority will take into account among other factors:

reasonable damages for disturbance including moving, legal and survey
costs;
b. the value of the goodwill of a business located on the expropriated
property if the business cannot be relocated;
c. if not included in the market value, the value of a special economic
advantage to the owner arising out of the owner's occupation of the land
and the value of improvements made by an owner occupying a residence on
the land; and
d. if the expropriated property has a limited market because of its use,
compensation may be based on the reasonable costs of rebuilding on
another site.
94. Where a fee simple estate or less than a fee simple estate in a
parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is expropriated by a Provincial Expropriating
Authority:
a. the parcel retains its status as Tsawwassen Lands;

that the Tsawwassen Law is inconsistent with the use of the parcel of
land for which the expropriation took place; and

is inconsistent with the use of the parcel of land for which the

required by a Provincial Expropriating Authority, the interest will be
returned to Tsawwassen First Nation subject to terms to be negotiated at

ACCRETED LANDS

Lands.
101. Where Tsawwassen First Nation provides to Canada and British
Columbia notice confirming that there has been lawful accretion within
the meaning of the
Land Title Act

Amendment chapter to change the boundaries of Tsawwassen Lands.

Nation in accordance with this Agreement does not, in and of itself,
result in British Columbia being liable in respect of any Contamination
of such lands.

First Nation in accordance with this Agreement, to the best of British
Columbia's knowledge those lands have not been used for a prescribed
industrial or commercial purpose or any other purpose or activity
prescribed under the
Environmental Management Act
, and British Columbia is not required to prepare or provide a Site
Profile for those lands.
106. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
recovering the costs incurred in the inspection or remediation of any

Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement
CHAPTER 6
LAND MANAGEMENT
POWER TO MAKE LAWS
1. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of:
a. the creation, ownership and Disposition of a Tsawwassen Fee Simple
Interest;
b. the ownership and Disposition of estates or interests in Tsawwassen
Lands including:
i. fee simple interests;
ii. mortgages;
iii. leases;
iv. licences, permits, easements and rights of way, including rights of
way and covenants similar to those in sections 218 and 219 of the
Land Title Act
; and
v. any conditions or restrictions on such estates or interests.
c. the ownership and Disposition of rights of access to any Tsawwassen
Lands to certain Tsawwassen Members for cultural purposes, including
gathering, and the recording of such rights of access by Tsawwassen
First Nation in accordance with arrangements made by Tsawwassen First
Nation with interest holders on Tsawwassen Lands;
d. the management and use of Tsawwassen Lands, including planning,
zoning and development;
e. the establishment and operation of a Tsawwassen First Nation land
title or land registry system:

Office; or
ii. for interests that are not recognized under Federal or Provincial
Law;
f. provision of services in relation to Tsawwassen Lands;
g. expropriation for public purposes or public works by Tsawwassen First
Nation of estates or interests in Tsawwassen Lands, if Tsawwassen First
Nation provides fair compensation to the owner of the estate or
interest; and
h. the approval of proposed developments on Tsawwassen Lands.
2. Despite subclause 1.g, Tsawwassen First Nation may not expropriate:
a. estates or interests granted or continued on the Effective Date where

c. estates or interests granted or continued on the Effective Date to a
provincial ministry or agent of the provincial Crown or for the use of a
Public Utility, whether or not an agent of the Crown, that would
otherwise have authority to expropriate an estate or interest in land
under provincial legislation or on whose behalf British Columbia may
expropriate.
3. For greater certainty, subclause 2.c describes an exception to the
Tsawwassen Government law making authority in respect of expropriation
and does not and is not intended to address the authority of a
Provincial Expropriating Authority to expropriate under provincial
legislation which authority is dealt with in the Lands chapter.
4. Tsawwassen Government may exercise authority over agriculture on
Tsawwassen Lands through land use planning and zoning under subclause
1.d.

division of matrimonial real property prevails to the extent of a
Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of matrimonial
real property made under subclause 1.a or 1.b. For greater certainty, a
Tsawwassen Law that may restrict the Disposition of real property to a
Tsawwassen Member is not a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of
matrimonial real property.
7. Despite clause 5, except in respect of the Former Tsawwassen Reserve
and any other Tsawwassen Lands excluded from an agricultural land
reserve designation, the
Agricultural Land Commission Act
prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law made under
subclause 1.d.
8. Despite clause 5, a Federal or Provincial Law in relation to
Environmental Assessment prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a
Tsawwassen Law made under subclause 1.h.
9. A Tsawwassen Law under subclause 1.a or 1.b in respect of estates or
interests that are recognized under Federal or Provincial Law must be
consistent with common law principles in respect of those interests and,
for greater certainty, a Tsawwassen Law in respect of a Tsawwassen Fee
Simple Interest is not inconsistent with common law principles.
10. Without limiting the scope of authority of Tsawwassen Government to
make laws under this Agreement, before Tsawwassen Government makes a law
under subclause 1.d, Tsawwassen First Nation will consult residents of
Tsawwassen Lands who may be affected by the proposed law, through a
process similar in principle to that required of a municipality
undertaking similar law-making.
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
11. Despite any approval of a proposed development made by Tsawwassen
First Nation under subclause 1.h, no Federal Project or Provincial
Project on Tsawwassen Lands will proceed unless there has been
compliance with any applicable Federal or Provincial Law in respect of
Environmental Assessment.
12. For greater certainty, Tsawwassen First Nation may establish
administrative procedures for evaluating proposed developments referred
to in subclause 1.h, including the environmental effects of the
developments.
PROVINCIAL INITIATIVES AND LAND USE PROCESSES
13. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
participating in processes or institutions, including processes or
institutions that may address matters of shared decision-making, or
benefiting from future provincial programs, policies or initiatives of
general application to First Nations as British Columbia develops a new
relationship with First Nations.
14. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
participating in, or benefiting from, federal or provincial
benefit-sharing programs of general application, in accordance with
general criteria established for those programs from time to time.
15. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
entering into arrangements that are consistent with this Agreement, with
willing third parties, in order to further economic opportunities for
Tsawwassen First Nation.
16. British Columbia will invite Tsawwassen First Nation to participate
in any provincial land use planning process affecting Tsawwassen
Territory on the following bases:
a. Tsawwassen First Nation will be consulted and may participate in the
same capacity as a Local Government, a First Nation or as a member of
the public, as the case may be; and
b. British Columbia will provide Tsawwassen First Nation with the
decision resulting from any such process and the reasons for that
decision.

Federal or Provincial Law.
TSAWWASSEN ALLOCATIONS
23. The Tsawwassen Allocations for Fish and Aquatic Plants are set out
in Appendix J-2.
24. In any year in which the Minister determines, in respect of a stock
or species of Fish or Aquatic Plants for which there is a Tsawwassen
Allocation expressed as a fixed number, that the quantity of that stock
or species that is available for harvest is not sufficient to meet all
anticipated allocations from that stock or species for food, social or
ceremonial purposes, the Minister may reduce any one or more of the
allocations for that year.
25. Where, under clause 24, the Minister wishes to reduce a Tsawwassen
Allocation, the Minister will inform the Joint Fisheries Committee of
the proposed reduction and, if time permits, will take into account any
written recommendations on the proposed reduction received from the
Joint Fisheries Committee before implementing the reduction.

the Minister will give reasons in writing for the reduction to
Tsawwassen First Nation and the Joint Fisheries Committee.
OVERAGES AND UNDERAGES
27. The Minister and Tsawwassen First Nation will endeavour to minimize
any overages or underages for Tsawwassen Allocations in each year and to
minimize the accumulation of overages and underages through adjustments
to the Tsawwassen First Nation annual harvest in successive years.
28. The Tsawwassen Fisheries Operational Guidelines describe the
process, timing and data sources for calculating overages and underages.
29. Unless Canada and Tsawwassen First Nation agree otherwise, the
determination of overages and underages described in the Tsawwassen
Fisheries Operational Guidelines will be consistent with the principles
described in Appendix J-3.
30. Overages and underages will not be applied to non-salmon Fish
species harvested under the Tsawwassen Fishing Right and managed by

establishment of a Tsawwassen Allocation for crab under clause 34 in the
twelfth year after the Effective Date or such other date as the Minister
and Tsawwassen First Nation may agree.
36. Where, under clause 34, the Minister or Tsawwassen First Nation
proposes the establishment of a Tsawwassen Allocation for a
Non-Allocated Species under the Tsawwassen Fishing Right, the Joint
Fisheries Committee will consider the proposal, taking into account:
a. Base Period information on the harvests by Tsawwassen First Nation of
that Non-Allocated Species for Domestic Purposes;

Joint Fisheries Committee has not agreed on recommendations for a
Tsawwassen Allocation, the Joint Fisheries Committee will notify the
Parties that they are unable to agree on a recommendation.
ARBITRATED TSAWWASSEN ALLOCATON
40. Where a proposal is made under clause 34 to establish a Tsawwassen
Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species and the Minister and Tsawwassen
First Nation have not agreed to a Tsawwassen Allocation for that
Non-Allocated Species within one year after the proposal, the Basic
Harvest Entitlement for that Non-Allocated Species will be finally
determined by arbitration, under the Dispute Resolution chapter, without
proceeding through Stages One and Two.
41. Where the Minister and Tsawwassen First Nation agree with the
recommendation of the Joint Fisheries Committee for studies, the Parties
may agree to extend the time period referred to in clause 39 or 40 to
allow for the completion of the studies referred to in clause 37.
42. The Minister or Tsawwassen First Nation may request that an
arbitrator describe a Basic Harvest Entitlement for a Non-Allocated
Species under the Tsawwassen Fishing Right as a defined harvest quantity
or quota, or a harvest quantity or quota determined by the use of a
formula, or a harvest quantity or quota determined by the use of a
formula in respect of a defined harvest area within the Tsawwassen

species, the Minister and Tsawwassen First Nation will, as soon as
practicable, negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on the Tsawwassen
Allocation for that species.
47. If, six months after an arbitrator provides a decision to the
Parties under clause 40, the Parties have not agreed on the Tsawwassen
Allocation for that Non-Allocated Species, the Tsawwassen Allocation for
that Non-Allocated Species is the Basic Harvest Entitlement times 1.25.
48. In the case of crab, where an arbitrator determines the Basic
Harvest Entitlement for crab under clause 40, the Parties will use that
Basic Harvest Entitlement as the Tsawwassen harvest level for crab until
the Parties reach agreement on a Tsawwassen Allocation under clause 46
or until a Tsawwassen Allocation is established under clause 49.
49. In the case of crab, if 30 months after an arbitrator provides a
decision under clause 40, the Parties have not agreed on the Tsawwassen
Allocation, the Tsawwassen Allocation is the Basic Harvest Entitlement
times 1.25.

loan repayments to Canada in accordance with the Negotiation Loan
Repayment Plan in Schedule 2.
4. Canada may set off and deduct from a payment made under clause 1, the
amount of a negotiation loan repayment to be made under clause 3 on the
same date, except to the extent that the negotiation loan repayment
amount has been prepaid in accordance with clause 5.
PREPAYMENTS
5. In addition to any negotiation loan repayment amount required under
clause 3, Tsawwassen First Nation may make loan prepayments to Canada.
All prepayments will be applied to the outstanding scheduled negotiation
loan repayment amounts in consecutive order from the Effective Date.
Tsawwassen First Nation will notify Canada in writing of a prepayment at
least 30 days before the date of that prepayment.
6. The "n" anniversary for which a prepayment is to be applied will be
the earliest anniversary for which a scheduled negotiation loan
repayment amount, or a portion thereof, remains outstanding. Any loan
prepayment applied to an outstanding negotiation loan repayment amount,
or to a portion thereof, will be credited at its future value, as of the
"n" anniversary, determined in accordance with the following formula:
Future Value = Prepayment * (1+C)K * (1+C*H/365)

"/" means divided by;
"*" means multiplied by;
"K" is the number of complete years between the date of the prepayment
and the "n" anniversary;
"H" is one plus the number of days remaining in the period between the
date of the prepayment and the "n" anniversary, once the number of
complete years referred to in "K" above has been deducted, and
"C" is 4.545 per cent per year.
7. If the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding amount
of the negotiation loan repayment amount scheduled for the "n"
anniversary, the excess will be deemed to be a prepayment made on the
"n" anniversary so that the future value of the excess will be applied
as of the next anniversary in a manner analogous to that described in
this clause.
8. On receipt of a prepayment, Canada will issue a letter to Tsawwassen
First Nation setting out the amount of the prepayment received and the
manner in which it will be applied.

Notes for Finalizing Schedule 1
These notes will not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these
notes is to enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the
amounts to be shown in the final version of this Schedule. The
Provisional Payment Amounts are expressed in second quarter 2006
dollars.
These instructions will be deleted, and will no longer form part of this
Agreement, when this Schedule is completed in accordance with these
instructions and the Effective Date occurs.
1. In these notes:
"FDDIPI" means the Final Domestic Demand Implicit Price Index for
Canada, series D100466, published regularly by Statistics Canada in
Matrix 10512: Implicit Price Indexes, Gross Domestic Product, or its
replacement series as specified by Statistics Canada;
"Revision Date" means the date 30 days before the Effective Date, or
another date if the Parties agree;
"Signing Date" means the date on which this Agreement is signed by the
Parties;
"Transition Date" is the date that is 15 months after the Signing Date.
2. If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is less
than 15 months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment amount in
the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be adjusted as follows:
provisional payment amount * M/L
where,
"/" means divided by;
"*" means multiplied by;
"L" is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2006 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time that the values used in M are
published; and
"M" is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar
quarter for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the
Revision Date.
3. If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is
greater than 15 months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment
amount in the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be adjusted as follows:
provisional payment amount * [(P/Q) * (1 + CR)Y * (1+CR*D/365)]
where:
"Q" is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2006 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time that the values used in P are
published;
"P" is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar
quarter for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the
Transition Date;
"Y" means the number of complete years between the Transition Date and
the Effective Date;
"D" is the number of days remaining in the period between the Transition
Date and the Effective Date, after deducting the complete years in that
period that have been taken into account in the determination of Y; and
"CR" is 4.545 per cent.
The purpose of applying clause 3 is to limit the period for which the
Capital Transfer is adjusted by FDDIPI to the period that ends on the
date that is 15 months after the Signing Date, and to lengthen the
period for which the Capital Transfer is adjusted by the calculation
rate to the period between the date that is 15 months after the Signing
Date and the Effective Date.
4. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in
accordance with either clause 2 or 3 of these notes, the Capital
Transfer Payment Plan will be amended to incorporate the adjusted

Notes for Finalizing Schedule 2
These notes will not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these
notes is to enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the
amounts to be shown in the final version of this Schedule.
The provisional loan repayment amounts are based on total outstanding
negotiation loans and interest accrued as of March 31, 2006. Final loan
repayment amounts, including any further negotiation loans made and
interest accrued after March 31, 2006, will be calculated and included
in the final loan repayment schedule in accordance with the following
notes.
1. In these notes:
"Revision Date"
is the same as the Revision Date in Schedule 1.
2. On the Revision Date, the provisional negotiation loan repayment
amounts in the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan will be adjusted to final
negotiation loan repayment amounts by:
a. determining the amount of the additional negotiation loans made by
Canada to Tsawwassen First Nation which were not included in the
calculation of the provisional negotiation loan repayment amounts and
any additional interest accrued since the provisional negotiation loan
and interest amounts were calculated; and
b. pro-rating and adjusting the additional amounts determined in
accordance with subclause 2.a of these notes for Tsawwassen First Nation
and apply these amounts to the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan such that
the amounts in the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan are
proportional to the amounts in the provisional Negotiation Loan
Repayment Plan and such that the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan
incorporates interest on unpaid loan balances, using 4.545% as an
interest rate per year beginning at the Effective Date and compounded
annually, which is the same rate of interest that was used to establish
the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan.
3. Canada will calculate the final negotiation loan repayment amounts
based on a document that Canada and Tsawwassen First Nation will produce
jointly before the Revision Date setting out the final negotiation loan
and interest amounts and the relevant terms and conditions of the loans
as at the Effective Date.
4. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in
accordance with clause 2 of these notes, the Negotiation Loan Repayment
Plan will be amended to incorporate the adjusted figures and the

Nation to the funding of the Agreed-Upon Programs and Services under
subclause 2.d, taking into account:
a. the capacity of Tsawwassen First Nation to generate revenues;
b. the existing Tsawwassen First Nation own source revenue arrangements

writing; and
b. will terminate on the earlier of:
i. the expiry of the extended term determined in accordance with
subclause 6.a; and
ii. the date of commencement of a subsequent Fiscal Financing Agreement.
7. The creation of Tsawwassen Government, the provision of Tsawwassen
Government legislative authority under this Agreement, or the exercise
of Tsawwassen Government legislative authority does not create or imply
any financial obligation or service responsibility on the part of any
Party, other than as set out in a Fiscal Financing Agreement.
8. For greater certainty, where the Parties agree in the initial Fiscal
Financing Agreement that Canada will provide Time Limited Federal
Funding for any Tsawwassen First Nation responsibilities specified in
that agreement and Canada duly provides the Time Limited Federal
Funding, Canada has no obligation to negotiate and attempt to reach

negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on the provision of further
funding for any of the responsibilities specified.
10. Any funding required for the purposes of a Fiscal Financing
Agreement, or any other agreement that is reached as a result of
negotiations that are required or permitted under any provision of this
Agreement and that provides for financial obligations to be assumed by a
Party, is subject to the appropriation of funds:
a. in the case of Canada, by Parliament;
b. in the case of British Columbia, by the Legislature of British
Columbia; and

would have applied, but for this Agreement, if the property were
situated on, or the interest were in, a Reserve.
20. Clause 17 only applies to an Indian during the period that section
87 of the
Indian Act
applies to the Indian.
21. If Tsawwassen First Nation imposes a tax within Tsawwassen Lands and
concludes a tax agreement for that purpose with Canada or British

relationships;
b. to prevent or minimize Disagreements;
c. to identify Disagreements quickly and resolve them in the most
expeditious and cost-effective manner; and

informal atmosphere.

a procedural requirement contained in this chapter, or in Appendix P, as
it applies to a particular Disagreement.
3. Participating Parties may agree to, or the Supreme Court of British
Columbia, on application, may order:
a. the abridgment of a time limit; or
b. the extension of a time limit, despite the expiration of that time
limit in this chapter or in Appendix P.
SCOPE: WHEN THIS CHAPTER APPLIES TO A DISAGREEMENT
4. In this chapter, and in Appendix P, a Party is deemed to be directly
engaged in a Disagreement if another Party, acting reasonably, gives the
first Party a written notice requiring it to participate in a process
described in this chapter to resolve the Disagreement.
5. This chapter is not intended to apply to all conflicts or disputes
between or among the Parties, but is limited to the conflicts or
disputes described in clause 6.

a. a conflict or dispute in respect of:
i. the interpretation, application, or implementation of this Agreement,
or
ii. a breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement;
b. a conflict or dispute, where provided for in this Agreement; or
c. negotiations required to be conducted under any provision of this
Agreement that provides that the Parties, or any of them, "will
negotiate and attempt to reach agreement".

unless the Parties have agreed that this chapter applies to that
agreement;
b. the implementation plan; or

resolution process, under a Federal or Provincial Law, to a conflict or

Disagreement.
9. Nothing in a Federal Law or Provincial Law limits the right of a
Party to refer a Disagreement to this chapter.
DISAGREEMENTS TO GO THROUGH STAGES
10. The Parties desire and expect that most Disagreements will be
resolved by informal discussions between or among the Parties, without
the necessity of invoking this chapter.
11. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Disagreements not
resolved informally will progress, until resolved, through the following
stages:
a. Stage One: formal, unassisted efforts to reach agreement between or
among the Parties in collaborative negotiations under Appendix P-1;
b. Stage Two: structured efforts to reach agreement between or among the
Parties with the assistance of a Neutral, who has no authority to
resolve the dispute, in a facilitated process under Appendix P-2, P-3,
P-4 or P-5 as applicable; and
c. Stage Three: final adjudication in arbitral proceedings under
Appendix P-6, or in judicial proceedings.
12. Except as otherwise provided, no Party may refer a Disagreement to
final adjudication in Stage Three without first proceeding through Stage
One and a facilitated process in Stage Two as required in this chapter.
13. Nothing in this chapter prevents a Party from commencing arbitral or
judicial proceedings at any time:
a. to prevent the loss of a right to commence proceedings due to the
expiration of a limitation period; or
b. to obtain interlocutory or interim relief that is otherwise available
pending resolution of the Disagreement under this chapter.
STAGE ONE: COLLABORATIVE NEGOTIATIONS
14. If a Disagreement is not resolved by informal discussion and a Party
directly engaged in the Disagreement wishes to invoke this chapter, that
Party will deliver a written notice, as required under Appendix P-1, as
soon as practicable to the other Parties, requiring the commencement of
collaborative negotiations.
15. Upon receiving the notice under clause 14, a Party directly engaged
in the Disagreement will participate in the collaborative negotiations.
16. A Party not directly engaged in the Disagreement may participate in
the collaborative negotiations by giving written notice to the other
Parties, preferably before the collaborative negotiations commence.
17. If the Parties have commenced negotiations in the circumstances
described in subclause 6.c then, for all purposes under this chapter,
those negotiations will be deemed collaborative negotiations and the
particular matter under negotiation will be considered a Disagreement.
18. Collaborative negotiations terminate in the circumstances set out in
Appendix P-1.
STAGE TWO: FACILITATED PROCESSES
19. Within 15 days of termination of collaborative negotiations that
have not resolved the Disagreement, a Party directly engaged in a
Disagreement by delivering a notice to the other Parties may require the
commencement of a facilitated process.
20. A notice under clause 19:
a. will include the name of the Party or Parties directly engaged in the
Disagreement and a summary of the particulars of the Disagreement; and
b. may propose the use of a particular facilitated process described in
clause 23.
21. Upon receiving a notice under clause 19, a Party directly engaged in
the Disagreement will participate in a facilitated process described in
clause 23.
22. A Party not directly engaged in the Disagreement may participate in
the facilitated process by giving written notice to the other Parties
within 15 days of delivery of a notice under clause 19.

Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement will attempt to agree to
use one of the following processes:
a. mediation under Appendix P-2;
b. technical advisory panel under Appendix P-3;
c. neutral evaluation under Appendix P-4;
d. elders advisory council under Appendix P-5; or
e. any other non-binding dispute resolution process assisted by a
Neutral
and if they fail to agree, they will be deemed to have selected
mediation under Appendix P-2.
24. A facilitated process terminates:
a. in the circumstances set out in the applicable Appendix; or
b. as agreed by the participating Parties, if an Appendix does not
apply.
NEGOTIATING CONDITIONS
25. In order to enhance the prospect of reaching agreement, the Parties
participating in collaborative negotiations or a negotiation component
of a facilitated process will:
a. at the request of a participating Party, provide timely disclosure of
sufficient information and documents to enable a full examination of the
subject matter being negotiated;
b. make every reasonable effort to appoint negotiating representatives
who have sufficient authority to reach an agreement, or who have ready
access to such authority; and
c. negotiate in good faith.
AGREEMENT
26. Any agreement reached in a process under this chapter
a. will be:
i. recorded in writing;
ii. signed by authorized representatives of the Parties to the
agreement; and
iii. delivered to all Parties; and
b. is binding only on the Parties who have signed the agreement.
STAGE THREE: ADJUDICATION — ARBITRATION
27. After the later of termination of collaborative negotiations, or of
a required facilitated process, in respect of a Disagreement arising out
of any provision of this Agreement that provides that a matter will be
"finally determined by arbitration", the Disagreement will, on the
delivery of a notice by a Party directly engaged in the Disagreement, to
all Parties as required under Appendix P-6, be referred to and finally
resolved by arbitration in accordance with that Appendix.
28. After the later of termination of collaborative negotiations, or a
required facilitated process, in respect of any Disagreement, other than
a Disagreement referred to in clause 27, and with the written agreement
of all the Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement, the
Disagreement will be referred to, and finally resolved by, arbitration
in accordance with Appendix P-6.
29. Where two Parties make a written agreement under clause 28, they
will deliver a copy of the agreement as soon as practicable to the Party
that is not directly engaged in the Disagreement.
30. Upon delivering a written notice to the participating Parties to the
arbitration within 15 days after receiving a notice under clause 27 or
copy of a written agreement under clause 28, a Party not directly
engaged in the Disagreement is entitled to be, and will be added as, a
party to the arbitration of that Disagreement whether or not that Party
has participated in collaborative negotiations or a required facilitated
process.
31. Despite clause 30, an arbitral tribunal may make an order adding a
Party as a participating Party at any time, if the arbitral tribunal
considers that:
a. the participating Parties will not be unduly prejudiced; or
b. the issues stated in the pleadings are materially different from
those identified in the notice to arbitrate under clause 27 or the
written agreement to arbitrate under clause 28,
and, in that event, the arbitral tribunal may make any order it
considers appropriate or necessary in the circumstances in respect of
conditions, including the payment of costs, upon which the Party may be
added.
EFFECT OF ARBITRAL AWARD
32. An arbitral award is final and binding on all Parties whether or not
a Party has participated in the arbitration.
33. Despite clause 32, an arbitral award is not binding on a Party that
has not participated in the arbitration if:
a. the Party did not receive copies of:
i. the notice of arbitration or agreement to arbitrate; or
ii. the pleadings and any amendments or supplements to the pleadings; or
b. the arbitral tribunal refused to add the Party as a participating
Party to the arbitration under clause 31.
APPLICATION OF LEGISLATION
34. No legislation of any Party in respect of arbitration, except the
Settlement Legislation, applies to an arbitration conducted under this
chapter.
35. A court must not intervene or offer assistance in an arbitration or
review an arbitral award under this chapter except as provided in
Appendix P-6.
STAGE THREE: ADJUDICATION — JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
36. Nothing in this chapter creates a cause of action where none
otherwise exists.
37. Subject to clause 38, at any time a Party may commence proceedings
in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in respect of a Disagreement.
38. A Party may not commence judicial proceedings in respect of a
Disagreement if the Disagreement:
a. is required to be referred to arbitration under clause 27 or has been
agreed to be referred to arbitration under clause 28;
b. has not been referred to collaborative negotiations or a facilitated
process as required under this chapter; or
c. has been referred to collaborative negotiations or a facilitated
process that has not yet been terminated.
39. Nothing in subclause 38.a prevents an arbitral tribunal or the
participating Parties from requesting the Supreme Court of British
Columbia to make a ruling respecting a question of law as permitted in
Appendix P-6.
NOTICE TO PARTIES
40. If, in any judicial or administrative proceeding, an issue arises in
respect of:
a. the interpretation or validity of this Agreement; or
b. the validity, or applicability of:
i. any Settlement Legislation; or
ii. any Tsawwassen Law,
the issue will not be decided until the party raising the issue has
properly served notice on the Attorney General of British Columbia, the

TERMS OF INSTRUMENT – PART 2
WITNESS THAT WHEREAS
the Transferor has agreed to grant to the Transferee a statutory right
of way over that parcel of land described in item 2 of Part 1 of this
instrument (hereinafter referred to as the "Land") for the purpose of
public access to the dike on the Land for which the Transferor is the
Diking Authority;
AND WHEREAS
the statutory right of way herein granted is necessary for the operation
and maintenance of the Transferee's undertaking;
NOW THEREFORE,
for valuable consideration and the covenants of the Transferee, the
parties agree as follows:
1.0 Grant of Statutory Right of Way
1.1 The Transferor, on the terms set forth herein, hereby grants to the
Transferee, in perpetuity, the non-exclusive statutory right of way
(herein called the
"Right of Way"
) over the Land for the Transferee, its licensees, agents, employees,
invitees and permittees (including the general public) between dawn and
dusk at their will and pleasure to:
(a) enter, go, be, return, pass and repass on, over, through and along
the Land by foot, for access to and use of the Land, for recreational
activity purposes; and
(b) do all acts or things necessary or incidental to the foregoing;
to have and to hold unto the Transferee, from and after the date of this
Agreement, unless and until discharged by the Transferee in accordance
with section 1.2, provided that nothing in this Agreement grants to the
Transferee, its licensees, agents, employees, invitees and permittees
(including the general public) the right to construct any improvements
or destroy any vegetation in or on the Land.
1.2 All of the rights, licences, liberties, privileges, easements and
statutory rights of way granted in this Agreement will exist and
continue in perpetuity unless and until discharged by the Transferee.
1.3 The rights, licences, liberties, privileges, easements, statutory
rights of way and covenants in this Agreement will run with and bind the
Land, in perpetuity.
2.0 Restriction of Right of Way
2.1 The Transferee acknowledges and agrees that the Right of Way over
the Land set forth in section 1.1 will be exercised only over those
portions of the Land shown outlined in bold on the sketch plan attached
as Schedule "A" ("Right of Way Area"), and the Transferee will not
otherwise exercise or otherwise attempt to exercise its Right of Way
over the Land under section 1.1.
2.2 The Right of Way granted by section 1.1 will be subject to the right
of the Transferor to:
(a) use the Right of Way Area in a manner that does not disrupt or
interfere with the Transferee, its licensees, agents, employees,
invitees and permittees (including the general public) in the exercise
of rights under this Agreement; and
(b) restrict access to the Right of Way Area on a temporary basis from
time to time as may be reasonably required for the maintenance and
operation of the dike.
3.0 Covenants of the Transferor
3.1 The Transferor covenants with the Transferee that, subject to
section 2.2:
(a) the Transferee shall and may peaceably enjoy and hold the rights
granted in this Agreement without interruption, disturbance, molestation
or hindrance whatsoever from the Transferor or any other person lawfully
claiming from or under the Transferor;
(b) the Transferor will not permit or make, place, erect, operate, use
or maintain any building, structure, foundation, pavement, excavation,
well, pile of material, obstruction, equipment, thing or inflammable
substance, or plant any growth upon the Right of Way Area, if any such
action or thing, in the reasonable opinion of the Transferee:
(i) may obstruct access to the Right of Way Area or any part thereof by
those authorized by the Transferee; or
(ii) may by its operation, use, maintenance or existence on the Right of
Way Area create or increase any hazard to persons or property in
relation to the Right of Way Area.
4.0 Notices
4.1 Where service of a notice or a document is required under this
Agreement, the notice or document shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been served if delivered to, or if sent by prepaid
registered mail addressed to, the Transferor and the Transferee, as the
case may be, at the addresses specified for each on the first page of
this Agreement, and where service is by registered mail the notice or
document shall be conclusively deemed to be served on the eighth day
after its deposit in a Canada Post office at any place in Canada. If
there is a disruption in mail services caused by labour dispute, civil
unrest or other events beyond the control of the parties, between
mailing and actual receipt of such notice, the party sending such notice
will re-send by courier, fax or other electronic means and such notice
will only be effective if actually received.
4.2 Either party may, by notice in writing to the other, specify another
address for service of notices under this Agreement and where another
address is specified under this section, notices shall be mailed to that
address in accordance with this section.
5.0 Miscellaneous
5.1 A breach of any term, condition, covenant or other provision herein
may only be waived in writing and any such waiver shall not be construed
as or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach. Consent or
approval of any act where consent or approval is required under this
Agreement, shall not be construed as consent to or approval of any
subsequent similar act.
5.2 The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall extend to, be
binding upon and enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.
5.3 Time is of the essence in this Agreement.
6.0 Interpretation
6.1 In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, the
singular includes the plural and the masculine includes the feminine
gender and a corporation.
6.2 The captions and headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience only and are not to be construed as defining or in any way
limiting the scope or intent of the provisions herein.
6.3 Where in this Agreement there is a reference to an enactment of the
Province of British Columbia or of Canada, that reference shall include
a reference to any subsequent enactment of like effect, and unless the
context otherwise requires all statutes referred to herein are
enactments of the Province of British Columbia.
6.4 If any section of this Agreement or any part of a section is found
to be illegal or unenforceable, that part or section, as the case may
be, shall be considered separate and severable and the remaining parts
or sections, as the case may be, shall not be affected thereby and shall
be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

A. Hydro will before commencing such works deliver to the Grantor for
approval a written work plan describing the proposed work on the Lands;

of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not undertaking the
work. If Hydro and the Grantor, each acting reasonably, cannot agree on

of the proposed work plan, then either party may refer the disagreement
to dispute resolution under section 14.1 of this Agreement;

order to protect the Works, or to protect persons or property that may
be at risk from the Works, and in that event Hydro will as soon as
reasonably possible thereafter notify the Grantor; and
E. generally, do all such other acts or things as may reasonably be
necessary or incidental to the business of Hydro in connection with any
of the foregoing.
3.0 Right of Way Area
3.1 The parties acknowledge that they have made reasonable efforts to
identify all the existing Works and related Right of Way Area as of the
date of this Agreement. However, as there may still be some Works that
were missed in the identification process the parties agree that for
such Works the Grantor grants to Hydro for so long as required, a right
of way over those portions of the Lands upon which such Works are
located on the following terms:
(a) for such Works, Hydro holds the same rights, privileges and
obligations as apply to Hydro for the use of the Right of Way Area and
the Area of the Works under this Agreement, including the right of
reasonable access over the Lands for the purpose of gaining access to
such Works; and
(b) the Grantor may at any time require Hydro to attach a revised survey
plan to this Agreement to include those additional portions of the
Lands.
4.0 Non-Exclusive Use
4.1 This Agreement will not entitle Hydro to exclusive possession of the
Hydro Right of Way Area or other parts of the Lands and the Grantor
reserves the right to grant other dispositions of any Lands affected by
this Agreement, so long as the grant does not materially affect or
interfere with the exercise of Hydro's rights under this Agreement.
5.0 Protection of the Environment
5.1 Hydro will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement
having regard for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent
measures to minimize the danger or disruption to the Environment.
6.0 Covenants of Hydro
6.1 Hydro covenants separately with the Grantor that:
(a) Hydro shall pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies,
charges and assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to
the account of Hydro which relate to the Works and which Hydro is liable
to pay;
(b) Hydro shall keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro under this
Agreement in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the
condition relates to the use or occupation of the Lands by Hydro, and on
written notice from the Grantor, to make safe, clean, and sanitary any
portion of them that contravene the provisions of this covenant,
provided that Hydro has no obligation to keep any portion of the Lands
suitable for use by anyone except Hydro;
(c) Hydro shall bury and maintain all underground works as may be
required so as not to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(d) Hydro shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize
disturbance of any archaeological material discovered by Hydro on the
Right of Way Area, and to immediately notify the Grantor;
(e) Hydro shall not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in
excavations or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary
structures as backfilling proceeds;
(f) Hydro shall not commit or suffer any wilful or voluntary waste,
spoil or destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be
done thereon anything that may be or become a nuisance or annoyance to
the Grantor, except to the extent required by Hydro acting reasonably,
to exercise its rights under this Agreement; and
(g) Hydro shall permit the Grantor to enter upon the Right of Way Area
at any time to examine its condition.
7.0 Work Plans
7.1 Except in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended
emergency, Hydro will provide to the Grantor a written work plan
describing the proposed work located on, outside or related to the Right
of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work under this
Agreement:
(a) construction of any new Works;
(b) relocation of any Works; and
(c) construction or relocation of any Access Improvements.
In accordance with this section 7.1, prior to undertaking any work,
Hydro will deliver a copy of the work plan to the Grantor for comment by
the Grantor. The Grantor will no more than thirty (30) days after
receiving the work plan, provide to Hydro in writing any comments that
it may have, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to accommodate any
suggestions or requests presented by the Grantor to Hydro provided they
do not result in delays, increased costs or technical difficulties.
8.0 Relocation of Works Due to Change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way
Area or the Excluded Right of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works,
then the Grantor will consent to the relocation and replacement of such
Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:
(a) Hydro will before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the
Grantor indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for approval
by the Grantor, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned;
(b) Hydro will take into account any likely material effect of the
relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into
account the cost efficiencies of the location selected by Hydro for the
relocated Works in relation to alternative locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and
(d) if Works are relocated from the Excluded Right of Way Area to the
Lands Hydro will pay the Grantor the fair market value of the new Right
of Way Area provided the Grantor has not caused any portion of such
Excluded Right of Way Area to become unsuitable for any of the Works.
9.0 Relocation of Works at the Request of the Grantor
9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right of Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Hydro will relocate
any Works in the Right of Way Area to a new location on the Lands,
provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Hydro, suitable
for use for the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance
and operation, and cost factors;
(b) the Grantor gives Hydro reasonable notice to permit proper design,
planning and construction of the Works to be relocated;
(c) the Grantor agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses,
including costs of design, supervision and construction (before any
relocation, the Grantor will pay the costs and expenses as estimated by
Hydro, with appropriate adjustments based on actuals after the
relocation is complete); and
(d) the rights, liberties and rights of way under this Agreement will
extend to the relocated Works and associated areas.
10.0 Removal of Works
10.1 If Hydro no longer requires all or a portion of the Right of Way
Area, then Hydro shall, in respect of such Right of Way Area:
(a) quit peaceably such Right of Way Area;
(b) remove any Access Improvements no longer required in relation to
such Right of Way Area;
(c) remove all above ground Works from such Right of Way Area within a
reasonable period of time and any Works remaining on that portion of the
Right of Way Area will be absolutely forfeited to and become the
property of the Grantor. If the Grantor removes any remaining above
ground Works within four (4) years, Hydro will, on demand by the
Grantor, reimburse the Grantor for all reasonable costs of removal; and
(d) remain liable for any environmental damage to the Lands arising from
any below ground Works that remain on or in such Right of Way Area,
except if the Grantor uses or authorizes the use of any of the remaining
below ground Works for any purpose then Hydro will not be liable for any
environmental damage caused by the Grantor's use, or authorized use; and
to the extent necessary, this covenant will survive the termination of
this Agreement.
11.0 Covenants of the Grantor
11.1 The Grantor covenants with Hydro that:
(a) Hydro shall and may peaceably enjoy and hold its rights under this
Agreement without interruption, disturbance, molestation or hindrance
whatsoever from the Grantor or any other person lawfully claiming from
or under the Grantor, provided however that nothing in this subsection
11.1 (a) shall limit the Grantor's right of inspection pursuant to
subsection 6.1 (g);
(b) the Grantor will not permit or make, place, erect, operate, use or
maintain any building, structure, foundation, pavement, excavation,
well, fill, pile of material, obstruction, equipment, thing or
inflammable substance, or plant any vegetation upon the Area of the
Works, if any such action or thing, in the reasonable opinion of Hydro:
(i) may interfere with or endanger the Works or any part thereof or the
installation, operation, maintenance, removal or replacement of the
Works or any part thereof;
(ii) may obstruct access to the Works or any part thereof by those
authorized by Hydro; or
(iii) may by its operation, use, maintenance or existence on the Area of
the Works, create or increase any hazard to persons or property in
relation to the Works;
(c) the Grantor will not diminish or increase the ground elevation in
the Right of Way Area by any method, including piling any material or
creating any excavation, drain, or ditch in the Right of Way Area,
unless permission in writing from Hydro has first been received, which
permission will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
(d) the Grantor will not carry out blasting or aerial logging operations
on or adjacent to the Area of the Works without prior written permission
from Hydro, which permission will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed;
(e) the Grantor will not use or authorize the use of the portions of the
Right of Way Area for the regular, or organized parking of vehicles
without the prior written permission from Hydro, which permission will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that
nothing in this subsection is intended to prevent safe temporary parking
of vehicles;
(f) the Grantor will not park, or authorize to be parked on the Right of
Way Area any vehicle or equipment if the parking of such vehicle does
not comply with the requirements of the Canadian Standards Association's
Canadian Electrical Code, as may be amended from time to time; and
(g) the Grantor will not use, or authorize the use of the Right of Way
Area for fuelling any vehicle or equipment.
12.0 Compensation for Damages
12.1 Subject to the rights granted in this Agreement, Hydro covenants
with the Grantor that if Hydro or its contractors, damage any
structures, buildings, fixtures, improvements, or chattels outside of
the Area of the Works, or damage any crops, merchantable timber,
livestock, drains, ditches, culverts, fences, trails, bridges, or roads
on the Lands, and such damage is not caused as a result of the Grantor's
breach of the terms of this Agreement or the negligence or willful act

persons or property in relation to the Works;
(c) to enjoy further rights as follows:
(i) Hydro and TELUS may, with the prior approval of the Grantor and any
party with a registered interest in the affected areas,, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, cut trees or

Hydro or TELUS such trees or growth might interfere with or endanger the
Works (whether on or off the Lands) or pose a hazard to persons or
property in relation to the Works;
(ii) Hydro and TELUS may pass and repass over, and maintain, repair
replace and use, all roads, lanes and bridges on the Lands outside of
the Area of the Works with or without equipment, machinery and materials

(iv) to conduct vegetation management upon the Area of the Works, such
as the planting of vegetation compatible with the undertakings of Hydro
or TELUS, and the application of herbicides and pesticides, provided

undertake works and take such steps on the Lands as are reasonably
required to be taken immediately in order to protect the Works, or to
protect persons or property that may be at risk from the Works, and in
that event Hydro or TELUS will as soon as reasonably possible thereafter
notify the Grantor; and

across any roads, lanes or bridges from time to time existing on or
through the Lands;

Schedule "C" reasonably represents the approximate location of the Works
existing as of the date of this Agreement. As and when new works are
added to the Lands by either or both of Hydro or TELUS, the parties will

the Grantor may grant to third parties other interests on the Area of
the Works, provided that any such grant of other interests shall not

adversely affect or interfere with the use by Hydro and TELUS of the
Works or Area of the Works.

Lands, as the case may be, provided that Hydro and TELUS have no
obligation to keep any roads within the Area of the Works suitable for
use by anyone except Hydro and TELUS;
(c) bury and maintain all underground works as may be required so as not
to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;

rights granted under this Agreement.

8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way
Area or an Excluded Right of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works,
then the Grantor will, at no cost to Hydro and TELUS, consent to the
relocation and replacement of such Works to a new location on the Lands,
as follows:

work, deliver a sketch plan to the Grantor indicating the contemplated
relocation of the Works for approval by the Grantor, which approval will

likely material effect of the relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the
Grantor will take into account the cost efficiencies of the location
selected by Hydro or TELUS for the relocated Works in relation to
alternative locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and

Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of TELUS, suitable
for use for the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance
and operation, and cost factors;
(b) the Grantor gives TELUS reasonable notice to permit proper design,
planning and construction of the Works to be relocated;

on or adjacent to the Area of the Works without prior written permission
from Hydro and TELUS, which permission will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; and
(d) the Grantor will not diminish or increase the ground elevation in
the Area of the Works by any method, including piling any material or
creating any excavation, drain, or ditch in the Area of the Works,
unless permission in writing from Hydro and TELUS has first been
received, which permission will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.
16.0 Compensation for Damages
16.1 Subject to the rights granted in this Agreement, Hydro and TELUS
covenant with the Grantor that if Hydro or TELUS damage any structures,
buildings, fixtures, improvements, or chattels outside of the Area of
the Works, or damage any crops, merchantable timber, livestock, drains,
ditches, culverts, fences, trails, bridges, or roads on the Lands, and
such damage is not caused as a result of the Grantor's breach of the
terms of this Agreement or the negligence or willful act of the Grantor
or its contractors, agents or permittees, then Hydro or TELUS, as the
case may be, will:
(a) compensate the Grantor for such damages, to the extent caused by
Hydro or TELUS; or
(b) within a reasonable period of time, repair in a good and
workman-like manner any damaged structure, building or improvement, as
closely as is practicable to its condition immediately prior to the
damage.

pay compensation to the Grantor, in accordance with generally accepted
principles of timber valuation, for any merchantable timber cut or
damaged by Hydro or TELUS on the Lands or outside of the Area of the
Works and the parties agree that on payment, title to any timber cut on
the Lands under this Agreement will vest in Hydro or TELUS, as the case
may be.
17.0 Indemnity
17.1 Hydro will at all times save harmless and indemnify and keep
indemnified the Grantor from and against all claims, demands, actions,
suits or other legal proceedings by whomsoever made or brought against
the Grantor by reason of or arising out of:
(a) any breach, violation or non-performance by Hydro of any of Hydro's
covenants, conditions or obligations under this Agreement; and
(b) any act or omission on the part of Hydro in respect of or in
relation to its Works including the construction, maintenance, operation
or decommissioning of its Works, but only to the extent any such matter
is found to be the responsibility of Hydro and was not contributed to by
the negligence, breach, violation or non-performance of the Grantor, and
not for any matters based on nuisance or the rule in
Rylands v. Fletcher
unless Hydro was negligent.
17.2 TELUS will at all times save harmless and indemnify and keep
indemnified the Grantor from and against all claims, demands, actions,
suits or other legal proceedings by whomsoever made or brought against
the Grantor by reason of or arising out of:
(a) any breach, violation or non-performance by TELUS of any of TELUS'
covenants, conditions or obligations under this Agreement; or
(b) any act or omission on the part of TELUS in respect of or in
relation to its Works including the construction, maintenance, operation
or decommissioning of its Works, but only to the extent any such matter
is found to be the responsibility of TELUS and was not contributed to by
the negligence, breach, violation or non-performance of the Grantor.

dispute be referred to mediation, conducted by a mediator, knowledgeable
about the matters in dispute;

the parties, then, on the agreement of the parties, the dispute may be
referred to a single arbitrator for final resolution in accordance with
the provisions of the British Columbia Commercial Arbitration Act. If
the parties do not agree to arbitration, then any party may refer the
matter to a court of competent jurisdiction; except that it is not
incompatible with this subsection for a party to apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction at any time for interim or conservatory relief
and for the court to grant that relief; and
(d) for the purposes of this section 18.1, Hydro and TELUS will only be
considered as one party where the dispute arises between the Grantor, on
the one hand, and Hydro and TELUS jointly, on the other.

2.0 Grant of Right-of-Way
2.1 Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Grantor grants a
Right-of-Way over the Lands to Terasen commencing on the date written
above and continuing for so long as any of the Right-of-Way is required
by Terasen, which Right-of-Way shall confer on Terasen, the right,
privilege, liberty and permit to:
(a) use the Works Area as follows:
(i) to excavate for, construct, install, erect, abandon, replace,
extend, upgrade, operate, maintain, alter, remove and repair the Works
on, over, under, across and through the Works Area;
(ii) to clear the Works Area and keep it cleared (including pruning or
removal) of any trees or growth at any time located therein; and
(iii) generally, to do all such other acts or things on the Works Area
as may reasonably be necessary or incidental to the business of Terasen
in connection with any of the foregoing;
(b) use the Area of the Works as follows:
(i) to enter, work, inspect, patrol, pass and repass upon, on, and along
the Area of the Works;
(ii) to clear the Area of the Works and keep it cleared of all or any
part of any obstruction, improvement or other matter which, in the
reasonable opinion of Terasen, might interfere with or endanger the
Works, disrupt service to Terasen's customers, or pose a hazard to the
Works or persons in relation to the Works;
(iii) to clear the Area of the Works and keep it cleared (including
pruning or removal) of all or any part of any trees or growth which do
or might, in the reasonable opinion of Terasen, interfere with or
endanger the Works, disrupt service to Terasen's customers, or pose a
hazard to the Works or persons in relation to the Works; and
(c) to enjoy further rights as follows:
(i) Terasen may, with the prior written consent of the Grantor, and any
party with a registered interest in the affected areas, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, cut trees outside
the Area of the Works, if in the reasonable opinion of Terasen such
trees would threaten to damage the Works or pose a hazard to the Works
or persons in relation to the Works;
(ii) Terasen may pass and repass over existing roads on the Lands for
access to and from the Area of the Works, and in the event that such
roads become closed to the public for any reason, the Grantor shall
nonetheless provide Terasen access to such roads for the purpose for
ingress and egress to and from the Area of the Works, to the extent
reasonably practicable, or to such alternative access as may be
available, at no additional cost to Terasen;
(iii) If no such road access is available, Terasen may have access to
and over other portions of the Lands for access to and from the Area of
the Works, provided that such access has been approved by the Grantor,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and by any
other person having an interest in such portion or portions; provided
that such approval is not required if access is necessary for
determining consumption or usage of services, in emergency situations or
for normal surveillance or safety inspection purposes;
(iv) Terasen may enter onto the Lands outside the Area of the Works for
the purpose of undertaking works to protect any Works located within the
Lands or within an Excluded Area or to protect persons and property that
may be at risk from such Works, provided that:
A. Terasen will deliver to the Grantor for prior approval a written work
plan describing the proposed work on the Lands;
B. the Grantor will not unreasonably withhold or delay approval of such
work plan and will not impose any unreasonable conditions relating to
the granting of such approval and shall take into consideration the
effect of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to
the cost of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not
undertaking the work. If Terasen and the Grantor, each acting
reasonably, cannot agree on a work plan within 30 days of receipt by the
Grantor of the work plan proposed by Terasen, then either party may
refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under section 17.1 of this
Agreement; and
C. in the event that any damage to the Lands results from the
implementation of the work plan by Terasen, Terasen will repair and
restore the damaged portion of the Lands as near as is reasonably
feasible, to their condition prior to the implementation of the work
plan or, at Terasen's discretion, pay to the Grantor appropriate
compensation in respect of such damage.
2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Terasen determines in its
reasonable judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are
imminent safety concerns or risk of public harm, Terasen may, without
approval of the Grantor, undertake works and take such steps on the
Lands as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to
protect the Works located within the Lands or within an Excluded Area,
or to protect persons and property that may be at risk from such Works,
and in that event Terasen will as soon as reasonably possible thereafter
notify the Grantor.
3.0 Works Area
3.1 The Works Area consists of all portions of the Lands reasonably
required by Terasen for the following:
(a) those Works existing at the date of this Agreement;
(b) any additional Works constructed adjacent to, along the sides of and
across any of the Grantor's roads from time to time existing on or
through the Lands;
(c) any additional Works that provide services to any lands adjacent to
any roads from time to time existing on or through the Lands; and
any such other portions of the Lands as are from time to time consented
to in writing by the Grantor, or any delegate appointed by the Grantor.
3.2 The parties agree that the sketch plan attached to this Agreement as
Schedule "C" reasonably represents the Works existing as of the date of
this Agreement. As and when new works are added to the Lands by Terasen,
the parties will update Schedule "C" to reflect such new works, it being
the intention of the parties for this Agreement and all of its terms and
provisions to apply to such new works in their entirety.
3.3 Nothing in this Part 3.0 is intended to affect the rights of Terasen
to make arrangements directly with a person in legal possession of any
lands for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Works and
all matters incidental thereto.
4.0 Non-Exclusive Use
4.1 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Terasen
acknowledges and agrees that:
(a) this Agreement does not grant a fee simple interest in the Lands to
or in favour of Terasen; and
(b) the Grantor may grant to third parties other interests on the
Right-of-Way Area upon prior written notice to Terasen, provided that
any such grant of other interests shall not compromise or, by action of
the Grantor or the grantee, damage, disrupt, adversely affect or
interfere with the use by Terasen of the Works or Right-of-Way Area.
5.0 Protection of the Environment
5.1 Terasen will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement
having regard for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent
measures to minimize the danger or disruption to the Environment.
6.0 Covenants of Terasen
6.1 Terasen covenants with the Grantor to:
(a) pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies, charges and
assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account
of Terasen, which relate to the Right-of-Way Area and which Terasen is
liable to pay;
(b) keep the Right-of-Way Area, and any Works, in a safe, clean and
sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Right-of-Way Area by Terasen, provided that Terasen
has no obligation to keep any roads within the Right-of-Way Area
suitable for use by anyone except Terasen;
(c) bury and maintain all underground Works as may be required so as not
to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(d) take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize disturbance of
any archaeological material discovered by Terasen on the Right-of-Way
Area, and to immediately notify the Grantor;
(e) not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in excavations
or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as
backfilling proceeds; and
(f) not commit or suffer any willful or voluntary waste, spoil or
destruction on the Right-of-Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon
anything that may be or become a nuisance or annoyance to the Grantor,
except to the extent required by Terasen, acting reasonably, to exercise
the rights granted herein.
7.0 New Works Constructed by Terasen
7.1 Prior to undertaking construction on the Lands of any new Works
which are not alterations, extensions or additions to existing Works,
Terasen, will deliver to the Grantor for prior approval, a sketch plan
showing with reasonable accuracy the location of any new Works, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
8.0 Relocation of Works Due to Change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right-of-Way
Area unsuitable for the continued operation and maintenance of any of
the Works, then the Grantor will consent, which consent will be, at no
cost to Terasen, to the relocation and replacement of such Works to a
new location on the Lands, as follows:
(a) Terasen will, before undertaking any work, deliver a sketch plan to
the Grantor indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for
approval by the Grantor, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable conditions;
(b) Terasen will take into account any likely material adverse effect of
the relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into
account the cost efficiencies of the location selected by Terasen for
the relocated Works in relation to alternative locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and
(d) subject to the foregoing, the cost of such relocation will be borne
by Terasen.
9.0 Relocation of Works at the request of the Grantor
9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right-of-Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Terasen will
relocate any Works in the Right-of-Way Area to a new location on the
Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Terasen, suitable
for use for the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance
and operation, and cost factors;
(b) the Grantor gives Terasen reasonable notice to permit proper design,
planning and construction of the Works to be relocated;
(c) the Grantor agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses,
including costs of design, supervision and construction (before any
relocation, the Grantor will pay the costs and expenses as estimated by
Terasen, with appropriate adjustments made based on actuals after the
relocation is complete); and
(d) without any further action required on the part of the parties, a
new Right-of-Way will be deemed to have been established upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, which will apply to and cover such
relocated Works.
10.0 Fencing and Use of the Right-of-Way Area
10.1 Except for the purpose of protecting any necessary above ground
Works, Terasen will not fence the Right-of-Way Area without the prior
consent of the Grantor. Any present or future lessees or permittees
having any rights with respect to the Right-of-Way Area are, subject to
the rights granted to Terasen herein, to be allowed free access to the
Right-of-Way Area and the use of the same except for:
(a) making, placing, erecting or maintaining any building, structure,
excavation, pile of material or obstruction or planning any growth on
the Area of the Works which, in the reasonable opinion of Terasen might
interfere with or endanger the construction, operation, maintenance or
removal of the Works or might reasonably obstruct access by Terasen to
the Works; or
(b) doing any act or thing that might reasonably interfere with or
damage the Works or create or increase any hazards to persons in
relation to the Works; or
(c) doing anything that would contravene the provisions of the
Gas Utility Act
,
Pipeline Act
, or Gas Safety Regulations pursuant to the
Safety Standards Act
, all as amended from time to time.

upon the Right-of-Way Area for the purpose of examining the Works Area
and the Works.

12.1 When a portion of the Works Area is no longer required for the
Works, Terasen will restore the ground surface to the affected portion
of the Works Area, as near as is reasonably possible to its condition
prior to the installation of the Works, including the removal of any
above ground Works.
12.2 Section 12.1 will survive the termination or expiration of this
Agreement.
13.0 Removal of Works
13.1 On the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Terasen may,
subject to the consent of the Grantor, abandon the Works and transfer to
the Grantor all ownership, right and interest in the whole or in part of

Terasen will remove the Works, where practicable, as soon as reasonably
possible in the circumstances.
13.2 Terasen will remain liable for any environmental damage to the
Lands arising from any below ground Works that remain on or in that
portion of the Right-of-Way Area after the termination or expiration of
this Agreement, except that if the Grantor uses or authorizes the use of

be liable for any environmental damage caused by the Grantor's use or
other use authorized by the Grantor.
13.3 Sections 13.1 and 13.2 will survive the termination or expiration
of this Agreement.
14.0 Covenants of the Grantor

and hold the Right-of-Way without interruption, disturbance, molestation

claiming from or under the Grantor, provided however that nothing in
this section 14.1 shall limit the Grantor's right of inspection pursuant
to section 11.1.
(b) the Grantor will not permit or make, place, erect, operate, use or
maintain any building, structure, foundation, pavement, excavation,
well, pile of material, fill, obstruction, equipment, thing or
inflammable substance, or plant any growth upon the Area of the Works,
if any such action or thing:

thereof or the installation, operation, maintenance, removal or
replacement of the Works or any part thereof;
(ii) may reasonably obstruct access to the Works or any part thereof by
those authorized by Terasen;

the Works or persons in relation to the Works;
(ii) Delta Cable may pass and repass over existing roads on the Lands
for access to and from the Area of the Works, and in the event that such
roads become closed to the public for any reason, the Grantor shall

work plan and will not impose any unreasonable conditions relating to
the granting of such approval and shall take into consideration the
effect of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to
the cost of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not
undertaking the work. If Delta Cable and the Grantor, each acting
reasonably, cannot agree on a work plan within 30 days of receipt by the
Grantor of the work plan proposed by Delta Cable, then either party may
refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under section 17.1 of this
Agreement; and

plan or, at Delta Cable's discretion, pay to the Grantor appropriate
compensation in respect of such damage.

reasonable judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are
imminent safety concerns or risk of public harm, Delta Cable may,
without approval of the Grantor, undertake works and take such steps on
the Lands as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to
protect the Works located within the Lands or within an Excluded Area,
or to protect persons and property that may be at risk from such Works,
and in that event Delta Cable will as soon as reasonably possible notify
thereafter the Grantor.

any roads from time to time existing on or through the Lands; and
any such other portions of the Lands as are from time to time consented
to in writing by the Grantor, or any delegate appointed by the Grantor.

Schedule "C" reasonably represents the Works existing as of the date of
this Agreement. As and when new works are added to the Lands by Delta
Cable, the parties will update Schedule "C" to reflect such new works,
it being the intention of the parties for this Agreement and all of its
terms and provisions to apply to such new works in their entirety.
3.3 Nothing in this Part 3.0 is intended to affect the rights of Delta
Cable to make arrangements directly with a person in legal possession of
any lands for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Works
and all matters incidental thereto.

or in favour of Delta Cable; and
(b) the Grantor may grant to third parties other interests on the

or interfere with the use by Delta Cable of the Works or Right-of-Way
Area.
5.0 Protection of the Environment
5.1 Delta Cable will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement
having regard for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent
measures to minimize the danger or disruption to the Environment.

assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account
of Delta Cable, which relate to the Right-of-Way Area and which Delta
Cable is liable to pay;
(b) keep the Right-of-Way Area, and any Works, in a safe, clean and
sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Right-of-Way Area by Delta Cable, provided that Delta

suitable for use by anyone except Delta Cable;
(c) bury and maintain all underground Works as may be required so as not
to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;

destruction on the Right-of-Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon
anything that may be or become a nuisance or annoyance to the Grantor,
except to the extent required by Delta Cable, acting reasonably, to
exercise the rights granted herein.

7.1 Prior to undertaking construction on the Lands of any new Works
which are not alterations, extensions or additions to existing Works,

plan showing with reasonable accuracy the location of any new Works,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.
8.0 Relocation of Works Due to Change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right-of-Way
Area unsuitable for the continued operation and maintenance of any of
the Works, then the Grantor will consent, which consent will be, at no
cost to Delta Cable, to the relocation and replacement of such Works to
a new location on the Lands, as follows:

to the Grantor indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for
approval by the Grantor, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable conditions;

effect of the relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will
take into account the cost efficiencies of the location selected by
Delta Cable for the relocated Works in relation to alternative
locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and
(d) subject to the foregoing, the cost of such relocation will be borne
by Delta Cable.

9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right-of-Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Delta Cable will
relocate any Works in the Right-of-Way Area to a new location on the
Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Delta Cable,
suitable for use for the relocated Works considering construction,
maintenance and operation, and cost factors;
(b) the Grantor gives Delta Cable reasonable notice to permit proper
design, planning and construction of the Works to be relocated;

(d) without any further action required on the part of the parties, a
new Right-of-Way will be deemed to have been established upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, which will apply to and cover such
relocated Works.

10.1 Except for the purpose of protecting any necessary above ground
Works, Delta Cable will not fence the Right-of-Way Area without the
prior consent of the Grantor. Any present or future lessees or
permittees having any rights with respect to the Right-of-Way Area are,
subject to the rights granted to Delta Cable herein, to be allowed free
access to the Right-of-Way Area and the use of the same except for:
(a) making, placing, erecting or maintaining any building, structure,
excavation, pile of material or obstruction or planning any growth on
the Area of the Works which, in the reasonable opinion of Delta Cable
might interfere with or endanger the construction, operation,
maintenance or removal of the Works or might reasonably obstruct access
by Delta Cable to the Works; or
(b) doing any act or thing that might reasonably interfere with or
damage the Works or create or increase any hazards to persons in
relation to the Works.

Agreement.

Lands arising from any below ground Works that remain on or in that
portion of the Right-of-Way Area after the termination or expiration of
this Agreement, except that if the Grantor uses or authorizes the use of
the remaining below ground Works for any purpose, then Delta Cable will
not be liable for any environmental damage caused by the Grantor's use
or other use authorized by the Grantor.
13.3 Sections 13.1 and 13.2 will survive the termination or expiration
of this Agreement.

enjoy and hold the Right-of-Way without interruption, disturbance,

nothing in this section 14.1 shall limit the Grantor's right of
inspection pursuant to section 11.1.
(b) the Grantor will not permit or make, place, erect, operate, use or
maintain any building, structure, foundation, pavement, excavation,
well, pile of material, fill, obstruction, equipment, thing or
inflammable substance, or plant any growth upon the Area of the Works,
if any such action or thing:

thereof or the installation, operation, maintenance, removal or
replacement of the Works or any part thereof;
(ii) may reasonably obstruct access to the Works or any part thereof by
those authorized by Delta Cable; or
(iii) may by its operation, use, maintenance or existence on the Area of
the Works, reasonably create or increase any hazard to persons or
property in relation to the Works;
(c) the Grantor will not carry out blasting or aerial logging operations

permission will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or accompanied by
unreasonable conditions.

15.1 Subject to the Right-of-Way granted herein, Delta Cable covenants
with the Grantor that if Delta Cable damages any structures, buildings,
fixtures, improvements, chattels, animals, crops or merchantable timber
owned by the Grantor anywhere on the Lands, and such damage is not
caused as a result of the Grantor's breach of the terms of this
Agreement or the negligent or willful act of the Grantor or its
contractors, agents or permittees, that Delta Cable will:
(a) compensate the Grantor for such damage to structures, buildings,
fixtures, improvements, chattels, animals, crops, or merchantable
timber; or
(b) within a reasonable period of time, repair in a good and
workman-like manner any damaged structure, building or improvement, as
closely as is practicable to its condition immediately prior to the
occurrence of the damage.
15.2 Despite section 15.1, Delta Cable covenants with the Grantor that
Delta Cable will pay compensation to the Grantor, in accordance with
generally accepted principles of timber valuation, for any merchantable
timber cut or damaged by Delta Cable on the Lands or adjacent to the
Right-of-Way Area and the parties agree that on payment, title to any
timber cut on the Lands under this Agreement will vest in Delta Cable.
16.0 Indemnity and Interest

indemnified the Grantor against and be responsible for all claims,
demands, actions, suits or other legal proceedings by whomsoever made or
brought against the Grantor by reason of or arising out of:

Delta Cable's covenants, conditions or obligations under this Agreement;

(b) any act or omission on the part of Delta Cable in respect of or in
relation to the Works including the construction, maintenance,
operation, decommissioning or removal of same.

amount of any loss or damage which may be suffered or sustained by the
Grantor by reason of or arising out of the matters set forth in section
16.1, including reasonable administration and legal costs, provided that
Delta Cable has the right to take up the defense of any such matters and
the Grantor agrees not to admit liability for, settle or compromise any

Tsawwassen Public Institution

ARTICLE 7
7.0 TERMINATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
7.1 If you fail to comply with any of your obligations under this
Agreement (a "default"), and the default has not been cured within 60
days after we give written notice of the default to you, or within such
longer period allowed by section 7.2, this Agreement will, at our option
and with or without entry, terminate, and all your right interest or
estate in the Land will be absolutely forfeited to us.
7.2 If a default (other than the payment of any money payable by you
under this Agreement) reasonably requires more time to cure than 60
days, then the 60 day period referred to in section 7.1 will be extended
for so long as is reasonably required to cure the default provided you
commence curing the default within the 60 day period and you continue to
diligently take steps to cure the default.
7.3 You will make no claim for compensation, in damages or otherwise,
upon the lawful termination of this Agreement under section 7.1.
7.4 If any dispute arises under this Agreement, including the issuance

all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute within 60 days of the
dispute arising or the notice, as the case may be (or within such other
time period agreed to by the parties) and, subject to applicable laws,
provide candid and timely disclosure to each other of all relevant
facts, information and documents to facilitate those efforts.
7.5 If a dispute under this Agreement cannot be resolved under section
7.4, the parties may agree to refer the dispute to arbitration conducted

commence any legal proceedings to which it may be entitled in respect of
the dispute.

receipt is required.
8.2 In order to expedite the delivery of any notice required to be given
by either party to the other, a concurrent facsimile copy of any notice
will, where possible, be provided to the other party but nothing in this
section, and specifically the lack of delivery of a facsimile copy of

ARTICLE 9
9.0 GENERAL
9.1 If any section of this Agreement, or any part of a section, is found
to be illegal or unenforceable, that section or part of a section, as
the case may be, will be considered separate and severable and the
remainder of this Agreement will not be affected and this Agreement will
be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Parties will
make their best efforts to amend this Agreement to remedy or replace
that section or part of that section as the case may be.
9.2 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the lease of the Land and no understanding or agreement,
oral or otherwise, exists between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement except as expressly set out in this
Agreement and this Agreement may not be modified except by subsequent
agreement in writing between the parties.
9.3 Where this Agreement contains the forms of words contained in Column
I of Schedule 4 of the
Land Transfer Form Act
, those words will have the same effect and be construed as if the
appropriate forms of words contained in Column II of that Schedule were
contained in this Agreement, unless the context requires another
construction of those words.
9.4 No provision of this Agreement will be considered to have been
waived unless the waiver is in writing, and a waiver of a breach of a
provision of this Agreement will not be construed as or constitute a
waiver of any further or other breach of the same or any other provision
of this Agreement, and a consent or approval to any act requiring
consent or approval will not waive or render unnecessary the requirement
to obtain consent or approval to any subsequent same or similar act.
9.5 No remedy conferred upon or reserved to us under this Agreement is
exclusive of any other remedy in this Agreement or provided by law, but
that remedy will be in addition to all other remedies in this Agreement
or then existing at law, in equity or by statute.
9.6 We are under no obligation, express or implied, to provide financial
assistance or to contribute toward the cost of servicing, creating or
developing the Land or the Improvements and you are solely responsible
for all costs and expenses associated with your use of the Land and the
Improvements for the purposes set out in this Agreement.
9.7 This Agreement does not override or affect any powers, privileges or
immunities to which you are entitled under any applicable law.

this Agreement.

Parcel Description of Rights of Refusal Lands
Note: The parcel descriptions listed below are based on the most
accurate information available to define the parcels. The information
will be updated before the Effective Date following a survey of some
or all of the parcels. In some cases, the parcel descriptions will be
amended to include road dedications and the granting of rights of ways
or easements for existing interests. This could result in the area of
some or all of the parcels being slightly reduced and the
corresponding titles being slightly more encumbered. Before the
readying of the parcels for disposition, British Columbia will meet
with Tsawwassen First Nation to discuss steps to be taken for readying
the parcels for disposition.

Tsawwassen Allocations for Fish and Aquatic Plants
Sockeye Salmon
In any year, the Tsawwassen Fishing Right Allocation for sockeye salmon
will be:
a) when the Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye
salmon is 500 000 or less, 1.0% of the Canadian Total Allowable Catch
for Fraser River sockeye salmon;
b) when the Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye
salmon is greater than 500 000 and less than 3.0 million, then 5 000
Fraser River sockeye salmon plus 0.40904% of that portion of the
Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye that is greater
than 500 000 and less than 3.0 million; and
c) when the Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye
salmon is equal to or greater than 3.0 million, then 15 226 Fraser River
sockeye salmon.
Chum Salmon
In any year, the Tsawwassen Fishing Right Allocation for chum salmon
will be 2.58% of the Terminal Surplus of Fraser River chum salmon to a
maximum of 2 576 Fraser River chum salmon.
Pink Salmon
In any year, the Tsawwassen Fishing Right Allocation for pink salmon
will be that number of fish caught incidentally in the harvest of
Tsawwassen Allocation for sockeye salmon, up to a maximum of 2 500
Fraser River pink salmon.
Chinook Salmon
In any year, the Tsawwassen Fishing Right Allocation for chinook salmon
will be determined by an abundance based formula, based on Canadian
Total Allowable Catch that produces an average annual harvest of 625
Fraser River chinook salmon based on Fraser River chinook salmon returns
for the 1982 to 2004 time period.
Coho Salmon
In any year, the Tsawwassen Allocation for coho salmon is an amount of
Fraser River coho salmon that will result in an annual average harvest
of 500 Fraser River coho salmon and will be harvested:
a) incidentally in fisheries that target other species; or
b) using selective harvesting techniques to capture specific coho
stocks.
APPENDIX J–3
Principles for Calculating Overages and Underages
The procedures for calculating overages and underages for each Salmon
species will be consistent with the following principles:
a) where a Tsawwassen harvest exceeded the defined Tsawwassen Allocation
for a Salmon species in a year, an overage has occurred for that species
and the amount of that overage will be accounted for in the multi-year
accounting process;
b) where a Tsawwassen harvest was less than the defined Tsawwassen
Allocation for a Salmon species in a year because another group
harvested more than their harvest share for that species, an underage
has occurred for that species and the amount of that underage will be
accounted for in the multi-year accounting process;
c) where a Tsawwassen harvest was less than the defined Tsawwassen
Allocation for a Salmon species in a year due to uncertainty in the
management process for that species, an underage has occurred for that
species and a defined portion of that underage will be accounted for in
the multi-year accounting process;
d) where a Tsawwassen harvest was less than the defined Tsawwassen
Allocation for a Salmon species in a year due to a lack of harvesting
effort on the part of Tsawwassen, no underage has occurred for that
species in that year; and
e) where Tsawwassen and Canada agree on an amount to be accounted or in
the multi-year accounting process for overages and underages for a
Salmon species, Tsawwassen and Canada will use that amount in the
multi-year accounting process.

26. The Neutral Appointing Authority, in appointing an arbitrator or the
chair of an arbitral tribunal, must have due regard to:
(a) any qualifications required of the arbitrator as set out in section
18 or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties; and
(b) other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an
independent and impartial arbitrator or chair.
GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE
27. When a person is approached in connection with possible appointment
as an arbitrator, that person must provide a written statement:
(a) disclosing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable
doubts as to their independence or impartiality; or
(b) advising that the person is not aware of any circumstances of that
nature and committing to disclose them if they arise or become known at
a later date.
28. An arbitrator, from the time of appointment and throughout the
arbitral proceedings, must, without delay, disclose to the parties any
circumstances referred to in section 26 unless the parties have already
been informed of them.
29. An arbitrator may be challenged only if:
(a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the
arbitrator's independence or impartiality; or
(b) the arbitrator does not possess the qualifications set out in this
Appendix or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.
30. A party may only challenge an arbitrator appointed by that party, or

Member, may not be challenged under section 28 solely on the grounds of
that membership or relationship.
CHALLENGE PROCEDURE
32. A party who intends to challenge an arbitrator will send to the
arbitral tribunal a written statement of the reasons for the challenge
within 15 days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral
tribunal, or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in
section 28.
33. Unless the arbitrator challenged under section 31 withdraws from
office, or the other parties agree to the challenge, the arbitral
tribunal must decide on the challenge.
34. If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or
under the procedure under section 31 is not successful, the challenging
party, within 30 days after having received notice of the decision
rejecting the challenge, may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to
decide on the challenge.
35. The decision of the Neutral Appointing Authority under section 33 is
final and is not subject to appeal.
36. While a request under section 33 is pending, the arbitral tribunal,
including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral
proceedings and make an arbitral award unless:
(a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the
Neutral Appointing Authority is made would unduly prejudice the parties;
or
(b) the parties agree otherwise.
FAILURE OR IMPOSSIBILITY TO ACT
37. The mandate of an arbitrator terminates if the arbitrator becomes
unable at law, or as a practical matter, to perform the arbitrator's
functions, or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay.
38. If a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to
in section 36, a party may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to
decide on the termination of the mandate.
TERMINATION OF MANDATE AND SUBSTITUTION OF ARBITRATOR
39. In addition to the circumstances referred to under sections 31 to
33, and 36, the mandate of an arbitrator terminates:
(a) if the arbitrator withdraws from office for any reason; or

replaced, any hearings previously held may be repeated at the discretion
of the arbitral tribunal.
43. An order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made before the
replacement of an arbitrator under section 39 is not invalid solely
because there has been a change in the composition of the tribunal.
COMPETENCE OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO RULE ON ITS JURISDICTION
44. An arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction.
45. A plea that an arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction must be
raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; but a
party is not precluded from raising that plea by the fact that the party
has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.
46. A plea that an arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its
authority must be made as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the
scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.
47. An arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in
section 44 or 45, admit a later plea if it considers the delay
justified.
48. An arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in section 44 or
45 either as a preliminary question or in the arbitral award.
49. If an arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has
jurisdiction, any party, within 15 days after having received notice of
that ruling, may request the Supreme Court to decide the matter.
50. A decision of the Supreme Court under section 48 is final and is not
subject to appeal.
51. While a request under section 48 is pending, an arbitral tribunal
may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award unless:
(a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the
Supreme Court is made would unduly prejudice the parties; or
(b) the parties agree otherwise.
INTERIM MEASURES ORDERED BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL
52. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may,
at the request of a party, order a party to take any interim measure of
protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of
the subject matter of the Disagreement.
53. The arbitral tribunal may require a party to provide appropriate
security in connection with a measure ordered under section 51.

the arbitral proceedings in the most efficient, expeditious and cost
effective manner as is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.

(b) selection of the arbitral tribunal's selected chair;
(c) the procedure to be followed in the arbitration;
(d) the time periods for taking steps in the arbitration;
(e) the scheduling of hearings or meetings, if any;
(f) any preliminary applications or objections; and
(g) any other matter which will assist the arbitration to proceed in an
efficient and expeditious manner.
61. The arbitral tribunal must prepare and distribute promptly to the
parties a written record of all the business transacted, and decisions
and orders made, at the pre-hearing meeting.
62. The pre-hearing meeting may be conducted by conference call.
PLACE OF ARBITRATION
63. The arbitration will take place in the Province of British Columbia.
64. Despite section 62, an arbitral tribunal may meet at any place it
considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing
witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods
or other personal property, or for viewing physical locations.
LANGUAGE
65. If the arbitral tribunal determines that it was necessary or
reasonable for a party to incur the costs of translation of documents
and oral presentations in the circumstances of a particular
Disagreement, the arbitral tribunal, on application of a party, may
order that any of the costs of that translation be deemed to be costs of
the arbitration under clause 44 of the Chapter.

the facts supporting its claim or position, the points at issue and the

subject matter.
69. The parties may amend or supplement their statements, including the
list of documents, and deliver counter-claims and defences to
counter-claims during the course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the
arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow the amendment,
supplement or additional pleadings having regard to:
(a) the delay in making it; and
(b) any prejudice suffered by the other parties.
70. The parties will deliver copies of all amended, supplemented or new

76. The arbitral tribunal must decide whether to hold hearings for the
presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the
proceedings will be conducted on the basis of documents and other

77. Unless the parties have agreed that no hearings will be held, the
arbitral tribunal must hold hearings at an appropriate stage of the
proceedings, if so requested by a party.
78. The arbitral tribunal must give the parties sufficient advance
notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for
the purpose of inspection of documents, goods or other property or
viewing any physical location.
79. All statements, documents or other information supplied to, or
applications made to, the arbitral tribunal by one party will be
communicated to the other party, and any expert report or evidentiary
document on which the arbitral tribunal may rely in making its decision
must be communicated to the parties.
80. Unless ordered by the arbitral tribunal, all hearings and meetings
in arbitral proceedings, other than meetings of the arbitral tribunal,
are open to the public.
81. The arbitral tribunal must schedule hearings to be held on

arbitral tribunal under oath or on affirmation in relation to the
Disagreement and to produce before the arbitral tribunal all relevant
documents within the individual's care, custody or control.
84. The document assemblies delivered under section 74 will be deemed to
have been entered into evidence at the hearing without further proof and
without being read out at the hearing, but a party may challenge the
admissibility of any document so introduced.
85. If the arbitral tribunal considers it just and reasonable to do so,
the arbitral tribunal may permit a document that was not previously
listed under section 67, or produced as required under section 70 or 74,
to be introduced at the hearing, but the arbitral tribunal may take that
failure into account when fixing the costs to be awarded in the
arbitration.

presented as a written statement, the other party may require that
witness to be made available for cross examination at the hearing.
87. The arbitral tribunal may order a witness to appear and give
evidence, and, in that event, the parties may cross examine that witness
and call evidence in rebuttal.
DEFAULT OF A PARTY

communicate its statement of claim in accordance with section 65, the
arbitral tribunal may terminate the proceedings.
89. If, without showing sufficient cause, a respondent fails to
communicate its statement of defence in accordance with section 66, the
arbitral tribunal must continue the proceedings without treating that
failure in itself as an admission of the applicant's allegations.

hearing or to produce documentary evidence, the arbitral tribunal may
continue the proceedings and make the arbitral award on the evidence
before it.
91. Before terminating the proceedings under section 87, the arbitral
tribunal must give all respondents written notice providing an
opportunity to file a statement of claim in respect of the Disagreement
within a specified period of time.

information or to produce, or to provide access to, any relevant
documents, goods or other personal property or land for inspection or
viewing.
93. The arbitral tribunal must give a copy of the expert's report to the
parties who must have an opportunity to reply to it.
94. If a party so requests, or if the arbitral tribunal considers it
necessary, the expert must, after delivery of a written or oral report,
participate in a hearing where the parties must have the opportunity to
cross examine the expert and to call any evidence in rebuttal.
95. The expert must, on the request of a party:
(a) make available to that party for examination all documents, goods or
other property in the expert's possession, and provided to the expert in
order to prepare a report; and

LAW APPLICABLE TO SUBSTANCE OF DISPUTE

tribunal may decide the Disagreement based upon equitable
considerations.

accordance with the spirit and intent of the Agreement.

party, with the agreement of the other parties, may refer a question of
law to the Supreme Court for a ruling.
100. A party may appeal a decision in the Supreme Court under section 98
to the British Columbia Court of Appeal with leave of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal. If the British Columbia Court of Appeal:
(a) refuses to grant leave to a party to appeal a ruling of the Supreme
Court under section 98; or
(b) hears an appeal from a ruling of the Supreme Court under section 98
the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal may not be appealed
to the Supreme Court of Canada.
101. While a request under section 98 is pending, the arbitral tribunal
may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award unless:
(a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the ruling of the Supreme
Court is made would unduly prejudice the parties; or
(b) the parties agree otherwise.
DECISION MAKING BY PANEL OF ARBITRATORS
102. In arbitral proceedings with more than one arbitrator, any decision
of the arbitral tribunal must be made by a majority of all its members.
103. If there is no majority decision on a matter to be decided, the
decision of the chair of the tribunal is the decision of the tribunal.
104. Notwithstanding section 101, if authorized by the parties or all
the members of the arbitral tribunal, questions of procedure may be
decided by the chair of the tribunal.
SETTLEMENT
105. If, during arbitral proceedings, the parties settle the

an arbitral award on agreed terms.
106. An arbitral award on agreed terms:

114. For purposes of section 112, an arbitral tribunal may award up to
50% of the reasonable and necessary legal fees and expenses that were
actually incurred by a party, and if the legal services were provided by
an employee or employees of that party, the arbitral tribunal may fix an
amount or determine an hourly rate to be used in the calculation of the
cost of those employee legal fees.

115. An arbitral tribunal must close any hearings if:
(a) the parties advise they have no further evidence to give or
submissions to make; or
(b) the tribunal considers further hearings to be unnecessary or
inappropriate.
116. A final arbitral award, or an order of the arbitral tribunal under
section 116, terminates arbitral proceedings.
117. An arbitral tribunal must issue an order for the termination of the
arbitral proceedings if:

the order and the arbitral tribunal recognizes a legitimate interest in
obtaining a final settlement of the Disagreement;
(b) the parties agree on the termination of the proceedings; or
(c) the arbitral tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings
has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible.
118. Subject to sections 118 to 123 and section 127, the mandate of an
arbitral tribunal terminates with the termination of the arbitral
proceedings.

where it is appropriate and it is requested by a party, adjourn the
proceedings to set aside the arbitral award for a period of time
determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity:
(a) to resume the arbitral proceedings; or
(b) to take any other action that, in the arbitral tribunal's opinion,
will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award.
129. A Party that was not a participating Party in an arbitration must

be a party to, and make representation on, the application.
APPEAL ON QUESTION OF LAW
130. A party may appeal an arbitral award to the Supreme Court, with
leave, on a question of law, which the Supreme Court must grant only if
it is satisfied that:

131. An application for leave may not be made more than three months:
(a) after the date on which the party making the application received

application to the Supreme Court, must be enforced subject to clause 136
and 137 of the Tsawwassen Government Chapter.
140. Unless the Supreme Court orders otherwise, the party relying on an
arbitral award or applying for its enforcement must supply the duly
authenticated original arbitral award or a duly certified copy of it.
GROUNDS FOR REFUSING ENFORCEMENT
141. Subject to sections 128 and 133, a Party that was not a
participating Party in an arbitration must not bring an application
under section 124 or 129 to set the award aside but may resist
enforcement of the award against it by bringing an application under
section 141.
142. On the application of a Party that was not a participating Party in
an arbitration, the Supreme Court may make an order refusing to enforce
