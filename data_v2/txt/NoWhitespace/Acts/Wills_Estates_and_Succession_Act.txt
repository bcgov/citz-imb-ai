Instruments
When a person is a spouse under this Act

Unless subsection (2) applies, 2 persons are spouses of each other for
the purposes of this Act if they were both alive immediately before a
relevant time and
(a)
they were married to each other, or
(b)
they had lived with each other in a marriage-like relationship for at
least 2 years.
(2)
Two persons cease being spouses of each other for the purposes of this
Act if,
(a)
in the case of a marriage, an event occurs that causes an interest in
family property, as defined in Part 5
[Property Division]
of the
Family Law Act
, to arise, or
(b)
in the case of a marriage-like relationship, one or both persons
terminate the relationship.
(2.1)
For the purposes of this Act, spouses are not considered to have
separated if, within one year after separation,
(a)
they begin to live together again and the primary purpose for doing so
is to reconcile, and
(b)
they continue to live together for one or more periods, totalling at
least 90 days.
(3)
A relevant time for the purposes of subsection (1) is the date of
death of one of the persons unless this Act specifies another time as
the relevant time.
Effect of adoption
3
(0.1)
In this section,
"pre-adoption parent"
means a person who, before the adoption of a child, was the child's
parent.
(1)
Subject to this section, if the relationship of parent and child
arising from the adoption of a child must be established at any
generation in order to determine succession under this Act, the
relationship is to be determined in accordance with the
Adoption Act
respecting the effect of adoption.
(2)
Subject to subsection (3), if a child is adopted,
(a)
the child is not entitled to the estate of the child's pre-adoption
parent except through the will of the pre-adoption parent, and
(b)
a pre-adoption parent of the child is not entitled to the estate of
the child except through the will of the child.
(3)
Adoption of a child by the spouse of a pre-adoption parent does not
terminate the relationship of parent and child between the child and
the pre-adoption parent for purposes of succession under this Act.
Construction of instruments
4
(1)
If this Act provides that a provision of this Act is subject to a
contrary intention appearing in an instrument, that contrary intention
must appear in the instrument or arise from a necessary implication of
the instrument.
(2)
Extrinsic evidence of testamentary intent, including a statement made
by the will-maker, is not admissible to assist in the construction of
a testamentary instrument unless
(a)
a provision of the will is meaningless,
(b)
a provision of the testamentary instrument is ambiguous

on its face, or

in light of evidence, other than evidence of the will-maker's
intention, demonstrating that the language used in the testamentary
instrument is ambiguous having regard to surrounding circumstances, or
(c)
extrinsic evidence is expressly permitted by this Act.
Division 2 — Survivorship Rules
Fundamental rule — when persons die simultaneously
5
(1)
If 2 or more persons die at the same time or in circumstances that
make it uncertain which of them survived the other or others, unless a
contrary intention appears in an instrument, rights to property must
be determined as if each had survived the other or others.
(2)
If
(a)
two or more persons hold property as joint tenants, or hold a joint
account, and
(b)
both or all of them die at the same time or in circumstances that make
it uncertain which of them survived the other or others,
unless a contrary intention appears in an instrument, for the purpose
of determining rights to property, each person is deemed to have held
the property or account as tenants in common with the other or with
each of the others.

6
If
(a)
an instrument provides for the disposition of property in the event
that a person named in the instrument

dies in circumstances that make it uncertain which of them survived
the other, and
(b)
the named person dies at the same time as the other person or in
circumstances that make it uncertain which of them survived the other,
for the purpose of that disposition, the event for which the
instrument provides is conclusively deemed to have occurred.

7
If
(a)
a will provides for a substitute personal representative in the event
that an executor named in the will
(i)
dies before the will-maker,
(ii)
dies at the same time as the will-maker, or
(iii)
dies in circumstances that make it uncertain which of them survived
the other, and
(b)
the named executor dies at the same time as the will-maker or in
circumstances that make it uncertain which of them survived the other,
for the purpose of the grant of probate, the event for which the will
provides is conclusively deemed to have occurred.
Posthumous births
8
Descendants and relatives of an intestate, conceived before the
intestate's death but born after the intestate's death and living for
at least 5 days, inherit as if they had been born in the lifetime of
the intestate and had survived the intestate.
Posthumous births if conception after death
8.1
(1)
A descendant of a deceased person, conceived and born after the
person's death, inherits as if the descendant had been born in the
lifetime of the deceased person and had survived the deceased person

the deceased person when that person died gives written notice, within

If
(a)
a right of a beneficiary to receive property is conditional on the
beneficiary surviving another person, and

the beneficiary dies at the same time as the other person or dies in
circumstances that make it uncertain which of them survived the other,

person.
(2)
If
(a)
property is left to 2 or more beneficiaries or to the surviving
beneficiary or beneficiaries, and
(b)
both or all die at the same time or in circumstances that make it
uncertain which of them survived the other or others,
unless a contrary intention appears in an instrument, the property
must be divided into as many equal shares as there are beneficiaries,
and the shares must be distributed respectively to those persons who
would have been entitled to a share in the event that each of the
beneficiaries had survived.
Five-day survival rule
10
(1)
A person who does not survive a deceased person by 5 days, or a longer
period provided in an instrument, is conclusively deemed to have died
before the deceased person for all purposes affecting the estate of
the deceased person or property of which the deceased person was
competent to give by will to another.

If 2 or more persons hold property as joint tenants, or hold a joint
account, and

survived the other by 5 days,

one half of the property passes as if one person survived the other

(5)
If the net value of an intestate estate is less than the spouse's
preferential share under subsection (3) or (4), the intestate estate
must be distributed to the spouse.
(6)
If the net value of an intestate estate is the same as or greater than
the spouse's preferential share under subsection (3) or (4),
(a)
the spouse has a charge on the intestate estate for the amount of the
spouse's preferential share under subsection (3) or (4), and
(b)
the residue of the intestate estate, after satisfaction of the
spouse's preferential share, must be distributed as follows:
(i)
one half to the spouse;
(ii)
one half to the intestate's descendants.
Two or more spouses
22
(1)
If 2 or more persons are entitled to a spousal share of an intestate
estate, they share the spousal share in the portions to which they
agree, or if they cannot agree, as determined by the court.
(2)
If 2 or more persons are entitled to apply or have priority as a
spouse under this Act in respect of an intestate estate, they may
agree on who is to apply or who is to have priority, but if they do
not, the court may make the decision.
No spouse but intestate leaving descendants or relatives
23
(1)
This section applies if a person dies without a will and without
leaving a surviving spouse.
(2)
Subject to subsection (3) and section 24, if a person dies without
leaving a surviving spouse, the intestate estate must be distributed
(a)
to the intestate's descendants,
(b)
if there is no surviving descendant, to the intestate's parents in
equal shares or to the intestate's surviving parent,
(c)
if there is no surviving descendant or parent, to the descendants of
the intestate's parents or parent,
(d)
if there is no surviving descendant, parent or descendant of a parent,
but the intestate is survived by one or more grandparents or
descendants of grandparents,
(i)
an equal part to the surviving parents or parent of each of the
intestate's parents, in equal shares of the part, but if a parent of
the intestate has no surviving parents, that part to the descendants
of those deceased grandparents, and
(ii)
for the purpose of subparagraph (i), a part is determined by dividing
the estate by the number of parents of the intestate
(A)
who have a surviving parent, or
(B)
who do not have a surviving parent but whose deceased parents have a
surviving descendant,
(e)
if there is no surviving descendant, parent, descendant of a parent,
grandparent or descendant of a grandparent, but the intestate is
survived by one or more great-grandparents or descendants of
great-grandparents,
(i)
an equal part to the surviving grandparents or grandparent of each of
the intestate's parents, in equal shares of the part, but if a
grandparent of the intestate has no surviving parents, that part to
the descendants of those deceased great-grandparents, and
(ii)
for the purpose of subparagraph (i), a part is determined by dividing
the estate by the number of parents of the intestate
(A)
who have a surviving grandparent, or
(B)
who do not have a surviving grandparent but whose deceased
grandparents have a surviving descendant, or
(f)
if there is no person who is entitled under paragraphs (a) to (e), the
whole intestate estate passes to the government and is subject to the
Escheat Act
.
(3)
For the purposes of this section, persons of the 5th or greater degree
of relationship to the intestate are conclusively deemed to have
predeceased the intestate, and any part of the intestate estate to
which those persons would otherwise be entitled must be distributed to
other descendants entitled to the estate.
(4)
Subsection (3) does not affect
(a)
the right of an intestate's descendants to inherit the intestate
estate even though they are of a greater degree of relationship than
the limit imposed by that subsection, or
(b)
the right of a person to apply under the
Escheat Act
on the basis of a legal or moral claim against the former owner of an
estate that has escheated to the government as property to which no
person is entitled to succeed as the owner.
(5)
For the purpose of subsection (3),
(a)
degrees of relationship are to be computed by counting upward from the
intestate to the nearest common ancestor of the intestate and the
intestate's relative, and then downward to the relative, and
(b)
relatives of the half kinship inherit equally with those of the whole
kinship in the same degree.
Distribution to descendants
24
(1)
When a distribution is to be made under this Part to the descendants
of a person, the property that is to be so distributed must be divided
into a number of equal shares equivalent to the number of
(a)
surviving descendants, and
(b)
deceased descendants who have left descendants surviving the person,
in the generation nearest to the person that contains one or more
surviving members.
(2)
Each surviving member of the generation nearest to the person that
contains one or more surviving members must receive one share, and the
share that would have been distributed to each deceased member if
surviving must be divided among that member's descendants in the same
manner as under subsection (1) and this subsection.
(3)

28
A personal representative must not, without the written consent of the
surviving spouse, dispose of the spousal home during the 180 days
after the date on which the representation grant is issued or for any

If a surviving spouse who exercises the right to acquire the spousal
home is the sole personal representative of the deceased person, the

(1)
If the fair market value of the deceased person's interest in the
spousal home exceeds the value of the surviving spouse's interest in
the estate under section 21
[spouse and descendants]
, subject to subsection (3) of this section, the surviving spouse may
purchase the remainder of the deceased person's interest from the
personal representative, or from those in whom that interest
beneficially vests, in accordance with the valuation of the deceased
person's interest in the spousal home as determined under this
Division.
(2)
The surviving spouse may purchase the deceased person's interest in
the spousal home under this Division whether or not the surviving
spouse is a personal representative of the deceased person and despite
any rule of law concerning the purchase of trust property by a
trustee.
(3)
Before a surviving spouse may make an application under section 33,
the surviving spouse must provide financial information as set out in
the Supreme Court Civil Rules to
(a)
the personal representative of the deceased person, and

Retention of spousal home

under subsection (2) if
(a)
the surviving spouse is ordinarily resident in the spousal home at the
time of the deceased person's death,
(b)
assets in the estate are not sufficient to satisfy the interests of
all descendants entitled to share in the intestate estate or that part
of the estate that is to be treated as an intestate estate without
disposing of the spousal home,
(c)
the court is satisfied that purchasing the spousal home under section
31 would impose a significant financial hardship on the surviving
spouse,
(d)
the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, a greater
prejudice would be imposed on the surviving spouse by being unable to
continue to reside in the spousal home than would be imposed on the
descendants entitled to share in the intestate estate or that part of
the estate that is to be treated as an intestate estate by having to
wait an indeterminate period of time to receive all or part of their
share of the intestate estate, and
(e)
either
(i)
the surviving spouse has resided in the spousal home for a sufficient
period of time to have established a connection to the spousal home,
or
(ii)
the surviving spouse has a sufficient connection with the community or
members of the community in the vicinity of the spousal home to
warrant an order under subsection (2).
(2)
The court may, subject to any terms or conditions the court considers
appropriate, make an order doing one or more of the following:
(a)
vesting the same interest in the spousal home in the surviving spouse
that the deceased person had;
(b)
specifying the amount of money the surviving spouse must pay to the
descendants towards satisfaction of their interest in the estate;
(c)
converting the remaining unpaid interest of the descendants in the
intestate estate into a registrable charge against the title to the
surviving spouse's interest in the spousal home;
(d)
determining an interest rate, as that term is defined in section 7
[interest rate]
of the
Court Order Interest Act
, or at any other rate the court considers appropriate, for the amount
the descendants are entitled to under paragraph (c) of this
subsection;
(e)
determining the value of the registrable charge referred to in
paragraph (c) to include the principal amount owing to the descendants
entitled to share in the intestate estate or that part of the estate
that is to be treated as an intestate estate and the expected value of
the future interest that will be earned under paragraph (d).
Registrable charges
34
(1)
A registrable charge referred to in section 33 (2) becomes due and
payable in the circumstances specified by the court, having regard to
prevailing residential lending practices in Canada, but if none are
specified, becomes due and payable on the earliest of the following:
(a)
twelve months after the date of death of the surviving spouse;
(b)
twelve months after the date the surviving spouse ceases residing in
the spousal home;
(c)
the completion date of the sale of the spousal home.
(2)
If a registrable charge payable under subsection (1) is not paid, the
owner of the registrable charge may take any action that a mortgagee
of land may take under the prescribed standard mortgage terms under
the
Land Title Act
.
(3)
A registrable charge is not enforceable until a form approved by the
Director of Land Titles accompanied by a certified copy of the court
order under section 33 (2), in relation to the registrable charge, is
registered under the
Land Title Act
.
(4)
The owner of a registrable charge, on receipt of payment of the total
amount secured by the registrable charge, must deliver to the
registered owner of the spousal home or to that person's
representative a release of the registrable charge in the form
approved by the Director of Land Titles.
(5)
A registrable charge may be released from the title to the spousal
home by filing in a land title office
(a)
a release of the registrable charge executed by the owner of the
registrable charge in the form approved by the Director of Land
Titles, or
(b)
a certified copy of a court order releasing the registrable charge.
Circumstances when registrable charge becomes payable
35
(1)
In this section,
"charge"
has the same meaning as in the
Land Title Act
.
(2)
In addition to the circumstances described in section 34 (1), a
registrable charge also becomes due and payable if the court, on
application by or on behalf of the owner of the registrable charge,
orders that it should become due and payable because of the following:
(a)
the surviving spouse has not paid an amount required to be paid under
or secured by a charge registered against the title of the spousal
home in priority to the registrable charge;
(b)
a tax or other charge is levied against the title of the spousal home
and has not been paid, unless payment has been lawfully deferred;
(c)
an action or failure to take action jeopardizes the value of the
spousal home to such an extent that it no longer provides sufficient
security for the total amount secured by the registrable charge;
(d)
the provisions of the registrable charge have not been complied with
or an event has occurred pursuant to those provisions by which the
amount secured by the registrable charge becomes due and payable.
(3)
If a registrable charge becomes payable by order of the court under
subsection (2), the surviving spouse has a period of 180 days to sell
the spouse's interest in the spousal home in order to pay, in full,
the amount secured by the registrable charge.
(4)
After the period referred to in subsection (3), the owner of the
registrable charge may take any action in respect of the registrable
charge that a mortgagee of land may take under the prescribed standard
mortgage terms under the
Land Title Act
if the surviving spouse has not sold the spouse's interest in the
spousal home or the owner of the registrable charge has not been paid.
(5)
The owner of a registrable charge may, before or after it is
registered in a land title office, postpone the priority of the
registrable charge to other charges.
(6)
The owner of a registrable charge may sell, assign or otherwise
dispose of the registrable charge before or after it is registered in
a land title office in a form approved by the Director of Land Titles.
(7)
If the sale of a spousal home yields sale proceeds that are not
sufficient to pay the full amount secured by a registrable charge the
court may order the release of the registrable charge, but may not
make any order to recover from the estate, the surviving spouse or the
estate of the surviving spouse any shortfall resulting from the
insufficiency of sale proceeds to pay the amount secured by the
registrable charge.

property by will in writing, signed by the will-maker at its end or by
some other person in the presence of and by the direction of the
will-maker.
(2)
If the will is signed by the will-maker, there is no need for a
witness to be present to witness or to sign the will as a witness.
(3)
If the will is signed by another person, the signature of that other
person must be witnessed by the signature of at least one person, who
must sign the will in the presence of the will-maker and of that other
person.
Clarification of doubt about signature placement
39
(1)
A will is conclusively deemed to be signed at its end if the
will-maker's signature is placed so that it is apparent on the face of
the will that the will-maker intended to give effect to the will,
including in, but not limited to, the following circumstances:
(a)
the will-maker's signature is placed
(i)
at or after the end of the will, or
(ii)
following, under or beside the end of the will;

the will-maker's signature does not immediately follow the end of the
will;
(c)

the will-maker's signature
(i)
is placed among the words of a testimonium clause or of an attestation

signature on or at the bottom of the side or page or other portion of
the same paper on which the will is written and preceding that on
which the will-maker's signature appears.
(2)
A will-maker's signature that conforms to this section does not give
effect to
(a)
a gift or direction in the will that follows the will-maker's
signature, or
(b)
a gift or direction inserted in the will after the will-maker signed
the will.
Witnesses to wills
40
(1)
Signing witnesses to a will-maker's signature must be 19 years of age
or older.
(2)
A person may witness a will even though the person may receive a gift
under it, but the gift may be void under section 43
[gifts to witnesses]
.
(3)
A will is not invalid only because a witness was, at the time the will
was signed by the will-maker, or afterwards became, legally incapable
of proving the will, unless the witness was not 19 years of age or
older at the time the will was signed by the will-maker.
Division 2 — Legal Effect of a Will
Property that can be gifted by will
41
(1)
A person may, by will, make a gift of property to which the person is
entitled at law or in equity at the time of the person's death,
including property acquired before, on or after the date the will is
made.
(2)
Unless a contrary intention appears in a will, when a will refers to
property, the will, with respect to the property, is to be interpreted
as if it had been made immediately before the death of the will-maker.
(3)
A gift in a will
(a)
takes effect according to its terms, and
(b)
subject to the terms of the gift, gives to the recipient of the gift
every legal or equitable interest in the property that the will-maker
had the legal capacity to give.
Meaning of particular words in a will
42
(1)
This section is subject to a contrary intention appearing in a will.
(2)
A gift of property in a will to persons described as "heir" or "next
of kin" of the will-maker or of another person takes effect as if it
had been made to the persons among whom and in the shares in which the
estate of the will-maker or other person would have been divisible if
the will-maker or other person had died without a will.
(3)
In a gift of property in a will
(a)
the words
(i)
"die without issue",
(ii)
"die without leaving issue", or
(iii)
"have no issue", or
(b)
other words importing either no descendants or no descendants in a
person's lifetime or at the time of the will-maker's death or a
complete absence of descendants,
are deemed to refer to no descendants or no descendants in the
lifetime or at the time of death of that person and not to a complete
absence of descendants of that person.
(4)
A gift of property to a class of persons that
(a)
is described as a will-maker's "issue" or "descendants" or by a
similar word, and
(b)
encompasses more than one generation of beneficiaries,
must be distributed as if it were part of an intestate estate to be
distributed to descendants.
Gifts to witnesses
43
(1)
Unless a court otherwise declares under subsection (4), a gift in a
will is void if it is to
(a)
a witness to the will-maker's signature or to the spouse of that
witness,
(b)
a person signing the will by the will-maker's direction, or the spouse
of the person signing, or
(c)
a person claiming under a person, other than the will-maker, referred
to in paragraph (a) or (b).
(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1), the relevant time for determining
whether one person is the spouse of another is the time when the will
was made.
(3)
If a gift is void under subsection (1), the remainder of the will is
not affected.
(4)
On application, the court may declare that a gift to a person referred
to in subsection (1) is not void and is to take effect, if the court
is satisfied that the will-maker intended to make the gift to the
person even though the person or the person's spouse was a witness to
the will.
(5)
Extrinsic evidence is admissible for the purposes of establishing the
will-maker's intention under subsection (4).
Residue of estate
44
If a will does not give or otherwise dispose of all of the
will-maker's property, the property that is not the subject of a gift
or otherwise disposed of in the will
(a)
must be distributed to the persons who would be entitled if that
property were an intestate estate, and
(b)
if there is no person who would be entitled under paragraph (a),
passes to the government and is subject to the
Escheat Act
.
Gift of land contemplating division
45
If a gift of land in a will to 2 or more beneficiaries contemplates a
physical division of the parcel by subdivision or otherwise, the gift
takes effect as a gift to the beneficiaries as tenants in common in
proportion to their interests, unless a contrary intention appears in
the will.
When gifts cannot take effect
46
(1)
If a gift in a will cannot take effect for any reason, including
because a beneficiary dies before the will-maker, the property that is
the subject of the gift must, subject to a contrary intention
appearing in the will, be distributed according to the following
priorities:
(a)
to the alternative beneficiary of the gift, if any, named or described
by the will-maker, whether the gift fails for a reason specifically
contemplated by the will-maker or for any other reason;
(b)
if the beneficiary was the sibling or a descendant of the will-maker,
to their descendants, determined at the date of the will-maker's
death, in accordance with section 42 (4)
[meaning of particular words in a will]
;
(c)
to the surviving residuary beneficiaries, if any, named in the will,
in proportion to their interests.
(2)
If a gift cannot take effect because a beneficiary dies before the
will-maker, subsection (1) applies whether the beneficiary's death
occurs before or after the will is made.
Property encumbered by security interest
47
(1)
In this section,
"purchase money security interest"
means a security interest taken in land or in tangible personal
property that
(a)
secures credit, including interest charges, provided to the will-maker
to acquire, improve or preserve the land or tangible personal
property, and
(b)
is registered under the
Land Title Act
or the
Personal Property Security Act
.
(2)
The interest of a beneficiary in a gift of property encumbered by a
purchase money security interest is, as between the different persons
claiming through the will-maker, primarily liable to pay the debt
secured by the purchase money security interest to the extent that the
debt is attributable to the acquisition, improvement or preservation
of the property.
(3)
If a purchase money security interest applies to more than one gift of
property in a will, each property is liable for payment of the
purchase money security interest proportionally, to the extent that
the debt is attributable to the acquisition, improvement or
preservation of each property.
(4)
Subsections (2) and (3) are subject to a contrary intention appearing
in the will, but a contrary intention is not signified by
(a)
a general direction in the will for the payment of debts, or
(b)
a charge of debts on the will-maker's estate,
unless the will-maker further signifies that intention by words
expressly or by necessary implication referring to all or some part of
the debt secured by the purchase money security interest.
(5)
Nothing in this section affects the right of a secured party to obtain
payment or satisfaction either out of other property of the deceased
person or otherwise.
Relief from disposition of property
48
(1)
In this section,
"proceeds"
means the gross proceeds at the time of disposition, and includes
(a)
non-monetary consideration, and
(b)
in the case of a gift, the fair market value of the gift.
(2)
If property that is the subject of a gift in a will is disposed of by
a nominee, the beneficiary of the gift is entitled to receive from the
will-maker's estate an amount equivalent to the proceeds of the gift
as if the will had contained a specific gift to the beneficiary of
that amount.
(3)
Subsection (2) does not apply if
(a)
the disposition is made to carry out instructions given by the
will-maker at a time when the will-maker was legally capable of giving
instructions, or
(b)
a contrary intention appears in the will.
Will exercising a power of appointment
49
A will made in accordance with this Act is, as to form, a valid
execution of a power of appointment by will, even if it has been
expressly required that a will in exercise of the power be made in
some form other than that in which it is made.
Rules if assets are not sufficient
50
(1)
This section is subject to a contrary intention appearing in a will.
(2)
If a will-maker's estate is not sufficient to satisfy all debts and
gifts, the debts and gifts must be satisfied or reduced in accordance
with this section.
(3)
Land charged by the will-maker with payment of debts or pecuniary
gifts, or both, is primarily liable for the debts and gifts, despite a
failure of the will-maker to expressly exonerate the personal
property.
(4)
Land and personal property must be reduced together.
(5)
Subject to subsection (3), assets are reduced in the following order:
(a)
property specifically charged with a debt or left on trust to pay a
debt;
(b)
property distributed as an intestate estate and residue;
(c)
general, demonstrative and pecuniary legacies;
(d)
specific legacies;
(e)
property over which the will-maker had a general power of appointment.
Gifts of unowned property
51
(1)
Subject to subsection (2),
(a)
a gift of property that the will-maker does not own is void, and
(b)
the rights of a beneficiary are not affected by the purported gift by
the will-maker of property owned by the beneficiary.
(2)
A will-maker may make a gift of property that is conditional on the
disposition by the beneficiary of property owned by the beneficiary.
Undue influence
52
In a proceeding, if a person claims that a will or any provision of it
resulted from another person
(a)
being in a position where the potential for dependence or domination
of the will-maker was present, and
(b)
using that position to unduly influence the will-maker to make the
will or the provision of it that is challenged,
and establishes that the other person was in a position where the
potential for dependence or domination of the will-maker was present,
the party seeking to defend the will or the provision of it that is
challenged or to uphold the gift has the onus of establishing that the
person in the position where the potential for dependence or
domination of the will-maker was present did not exercise undue
influence over the will-maker with respect to the will or the
provision of it that is challenged.
Division 3 — Abrogation of Common Law Rules
Common law presumptions abrogated
53
(1)
The presumption of law that a gift by a will-maker made during the
will-maker's lifetime to a child of the will-maker or to a person to
whom the will-maker stands in place of a parent is an advancement of a
portion that is intended to revoke a gift in the will-maker's will in
favour of the child or person is abrogated and the gift in the will
takes effect according to its terms.
(2)
The presumption of law that a legacy is revoked by a gift in the same
amount as the legacy made by the will-maker during the will-maker's
lifetime is abrogated and the legacy takes effect according to its
terms.
(3)
The presumption of law that a debt owed by a will-maker is satisfied
by a legacy to the creditor equal to or greater than the debt is
abrogated and the debt continues to be a claim against the
will-maker's estate.
(4)
The presumption of law that a binding promise by a person to make a
gift to advance a child in life is satisfied to the extent of the
benefit promised by a gift in the person's will to the child is
abrogated and the promise remains binding on the person and the
person's estate.
(5)
The abrogation of a presumption set out in any of subsections (1) to
(4) is subject to a contrary intention appearing in the will or
otherwise and extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove the contrary
intention.
Division 4 — Altering, Revoking and Reviving Wills
How to alter will
54
(1)
To make a valid alteration to a will other than an electronic will,
the alteration must be made in the same way that a valid will is made
under section 37
[how to make a valid will]
.
(2)
Subject to subsection (4), an alteration to a will is valid if the
signature of the will-maker to the alteration, and the witnesses to
that signature of the will-maker, are made
(a)
in the margin or in some other part of the will opposite to or near to
the alteration, or
(b)
at the end of or opposite to a memorandum referring to the alteration
and written in some part of the will.
(3)
An alteration to a will that is not made by the will-maker in
accordance with this section is ineffective
(a)
except to invalidate a word or provision that the alteration makes
illegible, unless the court reinstates the original word or provision
under section 58 (4)
[court order curing deficiencies]
, or
(b)
unless the court orders the alteration to be effective under section
58.
(4)
An alteration to a will that does not comply with subsection (2) is
valid if
(a)
the alteration
(i)
does not substantively alter the effect of the will, and
(ii)
is in respect of form, style or numbering or is a typographical error,
or
(b)
there is evidence to establish that the alteration was made before the
will was executed, if the alteration substantively alters the effect
of the will.
How to alter electronic will
54.1
(1)
A will-maker seeking to make an alteration to an electronic will must
make a new will in accordance with section 37
[how to make a valid will]
.
(2)
For certainty, section 54 does not apply to an electronic will.
How to revoke will
55
(1)
A will other than an electronic will or a part of a will other than an
electronic will is revoked only in one or more of the following
circumstances:
(a)
by another will made by the will-maker in accordance with this Act;
(b)
by a written declaration of the will-maker that revokes all or part of
a will made in accordance with section 37
[how to make a valid will]
;
(c)
by the will-maker, or a person in the presence of the will-maker and
by the will-maker's direction, burning, tearing or destroying all or
part of the will in some manner with the intention of revoking all or
part of it;
(d)
by any other act of the will-maker, or another person in the presence
of the will-maker and by the will-maker's direction, if the court
determines under section 58 that
(i)
the consequence of the act of the will-maker or the other person is
apparent on the face of the will, and
(ii)
the act was done with the intent of the will-maker to revoke the will
in whole or in part.
(2)
A will is not revoked in whole or in part by presuming an intention to
revoke it because of a change in circumstances.
How to revoke electronic will
55.1
(1)
An electronic will or part of an electronic will is revoked only in
one or more of the following circumstances:
(a)
by the will-maker, or a person in the presence of the will-maker and
by the will-maker's direction, deleting one or more electronic
versions of the will or of part of the will with the intention of
revoking it;
(b)
by the will-maker, or a person in the presence of the will-maker and
by the will-maker's direction, burning, tearing or destroying all or
part of a paper copy of the will in some manner, in the presence of a
witness, with the intention of revoking all or part of the will;
(c)
the circumstances described in section 55 (1) (a) and (b)
[how to revoke will]
;
(d)
by any other act of the will-maker, or another person in the presence
of the will-maker and by the will-maker's direction, if the court
determines under section 58
[court order curing deficiencies]
that
(i)
the consequence of the act of the will-maker or the other person is
apparent, and
(ii)
the act was done with the intent of the will-maker to revoke the will
in whole or in part.
(2)
A written declaration made in accordance with section
55 (1) (b) may be in electronic form and signed with an
electronic signature.
(3)
For certainty, an inadvertent deletion of one or more electronic
versions of a will or part of a will is not evidence of an intention
to revoke the will.
Revocation of gifts
56
(1)
This section is subject to a contrary intention appearing in a will.
(2)
If a will-maker
(a)
makes a gift to a person who was or becomes the spouse of the
will-maker,
(b)
appoints as executor or trustee a person who was or becomes the spouse
of the will-maker, or
(c)
confers a general or special power of appointment on a person who was
or becomes the spouse of the will-maker,
and after the will is made and before the will-maker's death the
will-maker and the will-maker's spouse cease to be spouses under
section 2 (2)
[when a person is a spouse under this Act]
, the gift, appointment or power of appointment is revoked and the
gift must be distributed as if the spouse had died before the
will-maker.
(3)
Despite section 2 (2.1), the operation of subsection (2) of this
section is not affected by a subsequent reconciliation of the
will-maker and the spouse.
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (2), the relevant time for determining
whether a person
(a)
was the spouse of a will-maker is at the time the will was made, or
(b)
became the spouse of the will-maker is at any time after the will was
made and before the spouses ceased to be spouses under section 2 (2).
Revival of will
57
(1)
A will other than an electronic will or a part of a will other than an
electronic will that has been revoked is revived only by a will that
shows an intention to give effect to the revoked will or the part that
was revoked.
(2)
Unless a contrary intention appears in the will that revives a will
under subsection (1), if a will that has been partly revoked and
afterwards wholly revoked is revived, the revival does not extend to
the part that was revoked before the revocation of the whole.
(3)
If a will has been revived by a codicil or has, by a codicil, been
re-signed in the presence of 2 witnesses, the will is deemed to have
been made at the time it was revived or re-signed.
(4)
A will or part of a will that has been revoked may not be revived
except
(a)
by an order of the court under section 58 if the court is satisfied
that the will-maker intended to give effect to the will or part of the
will that was revoked, or
(b)
in accordance with any other provision of this Act that recognizes the
revival of a will.

or testamentary disposition of the deceased person, or
(c)
the intention of a deceased person to revoke, alter or revive a
testamentary disposition contained in a document other than a will.
(3)
Even though the making, revocation, alteration or revival of a will
does not comply with this Act, the court may, as the circumstances
require, order that a record or document or writing or marking on a
will or document be fully effective as though it had been made
(a)
as the will or part of the will of the deceased person,
(b)
as a revocation, alteration or revival of a will of the deceased
person, or
(c)
as the testamentary intention of the deceased person.
(4)
If an alteration to a will makes a word or provision illegible and the
court is satisfied that the alteration was not made in accordance with
this Act, the court may reinstate the original word or provision if
there is evidence to establish what the original word or provision
was.
Rectification of will
59
(1)
On application for rectification of a will, the court, sitting as a
court of construction or as a court of probate, may order that the
will be rectified if the court determines that the will fails to carry
out the will-maker's intentions because of
(a)
an error arising from an accidental slip or omission,
(b)
a misunderstanding of the will-maker's instructions, or
(c)
a failure to carry out the will-maker's instructions.
(2)
Extrinsic evidence, including evidence of the will-maker's intent, is
admissible to prove the existence of a circumstance described in
subsection (1).
(3)
An application for rectification of a will must be made no later than
180 days from the date the representation grant is issued unless the
court grants leave to make an application after that date.
(4)
If the court grants leave to make an application for rectification of
a will after 180 days from the date the representation grant is
issued, a personal representative who distributes any part of the
estate to which entitlement is subsequently affected by rectification
is not liable if, in reasonable reliance on the will, the distribution
is made
(a)
after 180 days from the date the representation grant is issued, and
(b)
before the notice of the application for rectification is delivered to
the personal representative.
(5)
Subsection (4) does not affect the right of any person to recover from
a beneficiary any part of the estate distributed in the circumstances
described in that subsection.
Division 6 — Variation of Wills
Maintenance from estate
60
Despite any law or enactment to the contrary, if a will-maker dies
leaving a will that does not, in the court's opinion, make adequate
provision for the proper maintenance and support of the will-maker's
spouse or children, the court may, in a proceeding by or on behalf of
the spouse or children, order that the provision that it thinks
adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances be made out of the

a plaintiff in a proceeding under this Division may register, in the

The court may
(a)
attach to an order under this Division any conditions that it thinks

is appropriate, order that
(a)
the provision for the will-maker's spouse or children is to consist of

(b)
a trust be created in favour of the will-maker's spouse or children.
Payments fall rateably on estate
65
(1)
Unless the court otherwise determines, the incidence of the payments
ordered by the court under this Division falls rateably on the
will-maker's estate.
(2)

released from further liability.
(2)
In making an order under subsection (1), the court may give directions
concerning the security and disposition of the periodic payment or
lump sum under subsection (1).

provisions of the order, but the order does not bind land unless the
order is registered, in the land title office in which the title to
the land is registered, as a charge against the land affected.
Registration of title
69
(1)
Title to property distributed by gift in a will to a beneficiary must
not be registered in a land title office except after the time set out

whole or in part, in the person's entitlement to adequate provision
separate from the order, and

cancel, vary or suspend its order, or make another order.

78
The validity of a will and the validity of a revocation of a will are
not affected by filing or not filing a notice under this Division.
Division 8 — Conflict of Laws
Interpretation
79
(1)
In this Division, a reference to the law of a place other than British
Columbia is a reference to the internal law only of that place and
does not include its conflict of laws rules.
(2)
A requirement of the law of a place other than British Columbia that
(a)
certain formalities must be observed by will-makers of a particular
description when making a will, or
(b)
witnesses to wills must have certain qualifications
is a formal requirement only that does not affect the essential
validity of the will.
Validity of wills made in accordance with other laws
80
(1)
A will is valid as to the formal requirements for making the will and
is admissible to probate if it is made in accordance
(a)
with the law of the place where the will is made,
(b)
with the law of the will-maker's domicile, either at the date the will
is made or at the date of the will-maker's death,
(c)
with the law of the will-maker's ordinary residence, either at the
date the will is made or at the date of the will-maker's death,
(d)
with the law of a country of which the will-maker was a citizen,
either at the date the will is made or at the date of the will-maker's
death,
(e)
with the law of British Columbia, but the will is made outside British
Columbia,
(f)
with the law of the place where the will-maker's property is situated
at the date the will is made or at the date of the will-maker's death,
(g)
in the case of a will made on board a vessel or aircraft of any
description, with the law of the place with which, having regard to
the registration, if any, of a vessel or aircraft, the vessel or
aircraft is most closely connected, or
(h)
to the extent that the will exercises a power of appointment, with the
law governing the essential validity of that power.
(2)
If a will is not valid under subsection (1), it is deemed to be valid
if a subsequent amendment to the law of the relevant jurisdiction
before the deceased person's death would have validated the will.
(3)
The formal validity of a will that revokes
(a)
a will that would be treated as formally valid under this Division, or
(b)
a provision of a will that would be treated under this Division as a
formally valid provision,
may be determined by reference to any law under which the revoked will
or provision of the will would be treated as formally valid and that
is relevant for that purpose under this Division.
Resort to other aids to construction
81
In the construction of a will to which this Division applies, the
court may resort to the law of the place where the will-maker was
domiciled or was ordinarily resident at the time the will was made.
Interest in an immovable
