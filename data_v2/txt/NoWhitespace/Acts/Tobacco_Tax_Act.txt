if the director has not realized on any of the assets against which
the lien was registered, promptly release the lien, and

if the director has realized on some or all of the assets against
which the lien was registered, promptly release the lien against the

the lien and payment of the applicable net sale proceeds under
subsection (18) (b) is deemed to be full satisfaction of all claims
any person, including the corporation, might have arising out of or in
