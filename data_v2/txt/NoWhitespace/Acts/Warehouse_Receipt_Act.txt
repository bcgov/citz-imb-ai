Form of receipts

A receipt must contain all of the following particulars:

the location of the warehouse or other place where the goods are
stored;
(b)
the name of the person by whom or on whose behalf the goods are
deposited;
(c)
the date of issue of the receipt;
(d)
a statement either
(i)
that the goods received will be delivered to the person by whom or on
whose behalf the goods are deposited, or to another named person, or
(ii)
that the goods will be delivered to bearer or to the order of a named
person;
(e)
the rate of storage charges;
(f)
a description of the goods or of the packages containing them;
(g)
the signature of the warehouser or the authorized agent of the
warehouser;
(h)
a statement of the amount of any advance made and of any liability
incurred for which the warehouser claims a lien.
(2)
If a warehouser omits from a negotiable receipt any of the particulars
set out in subsection (1), the warehouser is liable for damage caused
by the omission.
(3)
A receipt must not be considered not to be a warehouse receipt because
of the omission of any of the particulars set out in subsection (1).
(4)
A warehouser may insert in a receipt issued by the warehouser any
other term or condition that
(a)
is not contrary to any provision of this Act, and
(b)
does not impair the warehouser's obligation to exercise the care and
diligence in regard to the goods as a careful and vigilant owner of
similar goods would exercise in the custody of them in similar
circumstances.
Negotiable receipts
3
Words in a negotiable receipt limiting its negotiability are void.
Duplicate receipts
4
(1)
Only one receipt may be issued in respect of the same goods except in
case of a lost or destroyed receipt, in which case the new receipt, if
one is given, must bear the same date as the original and must be
plainly marked on its face "duplicate".
(2)
If a warehouser fails to comply with subsection (1), the warehouser is
liable for all damage caused by the failure to any person who
purchases the subsequent receipt for valuable consideration, believing
it to be an original, even though the purchase is after the delivery
of the goods by the warehouser to the holder of the original receipt.
(3)
A receipt on the face of which the word "duplicate" is plainly marked
is a representation and warranty by the warehouser that it is an
accurate copy of a receipt properly issued and uncancelled at the date
of the issue of the duplicate.
Marking of nonnegotiable receipts
5
(1)
A warehouser who issues a nonnegotiable receipt must cause to be
plainly marked on its face "nonnegotiable" or "not negotiable".
(2)
If a warehouser fails to comply with subsection (1), a holder of the
receipt who purchases it for valuable consideration believing it to be
negotiable may, at the holder's option, treat the receipt as vesting
in the holder all rights attaching to a negotiable receipt and
imposing on the warehouser the same liabilities the warehouser would
have incurred had the receipt been negotiable and the warehouser is
liable accordingly.
Duty to deliver
6
(1)
In the absence of a lawful excuse, a warehouser must deliver the goods
referred to in a negotiable receipt, to the bearer of the receipt on
demand made by the bearer and on the bearer doing all of the
following:
(a)
satisfying the warehouse lien;
(b)
surrendering the receipt with endorsements necessary for the
negotiation of the receipt;
(c)
acknowledging in writing the delivery of the goods.
(2)
In the absence of a lawful excuse, a warehouser must deliver the goods
referred to in a nonnegotiable receipt to the holder of the receipt on
demand made by the holder and on the holder doing all of the
following:
(a)
satisfying the warehouse lien;
(b)
surrendering the receipt;
(c)
acknowledging in writing the delivery of the goods.
(3)
If a warehouser refuses or fails to deliver the goods in compliance
with this section, the burden is on the warehouser to establish the
existence of a lawful excuse for the refusal or failure.
Delivery on presentation of negotiable receipt
7
If a person is in possession of a negotiable receipt that has been
endorsed to the person or endorsed in blank, or by the terms of which
the goods are deliverable to the person or the person's order or to
bearer, the warehouser is justified in delivering the goods to that
person if delivery is made in good faith and without notice of any
defect in the title of that person.
Cancelling negotiable receipts on delivery of goods
8
(1)
Except as provided in section 18, if a warehouser
(a)
delivers goods for which the warehouser has issued a negotiable
receipt, and
(b)
fails to take up and cancel the receipt,
the warehouser is liable for failure to deliver the goods to anyone
who purchases the receipt in good faith and for valuable
consideration, whether the purchaser acquired title to the receipt
before or after delivery of the goods by the warehouser.
(2)
Except as provided in section 18, if a warehouser
(a)
delivers part of the goods for which the warehouser has issued a
negotiable receipt and
(b)
fails either
(i)
to take up and cancel the receipt, or
(ii)
to place plainly on it a statement of what goods or packages have been
delivered,
the warehouser is liable, for failure to deliver all the goods
specified in the receipt, to anyone who purchases the receipt in good
faith and for valuable consideration, whether the purchaser acquired
title to the receipt before or after the delivery of any portion of
the goods.
Lost or destroyed receipts
9
(1)
If a negotiable receipt has been lost or destroyed, the person
lawfully entitled to the goods may apply to the Supreme Court for an
order under this section after giving notice to the warehouser.
(2)
On an application, the court may order the delivery of the goods
(a)
on satisfactory proof of the loss or destruction of the receipt, and
(b)
on the giving of a bond with sufficient sureties to be approved in
accordance with the practice of the court to indemnify the warehouser
against any liability, cost or expense the warehouser may be under or
be put to because the original receipt remains outstanding.
(3)
The warehouser is entitled to the warehouser's costs of an
application.
Reasonable time to determine validity of claims
10
If a warehouser has information that a person other than the holder of
a receipt claims to be the owner of or entitled to the goods the
warehouser may refuse to deliver the goods until the warehouser has
had a reasonable time, not longer than 10 days, to determine the
validity of the adverse claim or to commence interpleader proceedings.
Conclusiveness of negotiable receipt
11
(1)
In the hands of a holder who has purchased it for valuable
consideration, a negotiable receipt is conclusive evidence of the
receipt by the warehouser of the goods described in it as against the
warehouser and any person signing it on the warehouser's behalf.
(2)
Subsection (1) applies, even though the goods or some part of them may
not have been received, unless the holder of the negotiable receipt
has actual notice at the time of receiving it that the goods had not
in fact been received.
Description of goods in receipt
12
If goods are described in a receipt merely by a statement
(a)
of certain marks or labels on the goods or on the packages containing
them,
(b)
that the goods are said by the depositor to be goods of a certain
kind, or
(c)
that the packages containing the goods are said by the depositor to
contain goods of a certain kind,
or by a statement of import similar to that of paragraph (a), (b) or
(c), the statement does not impose any liability on the warehouser in
respect of the nature, kind or quality of the goods, but is a
representation by the warehouser either that the marks or labels were
in fact on the goods or packages or that the goods were in fact
described by the depositor as stated or that the packages containing
the goods were in fact described by the depositor as containing goods
of a certain kind.
Liability for care of goods
13
A warehouser is liable for loss of or injury to goods caused by the
warehouser's failure to exercise the care and diligence in regard to
them as a careful and vigilant owner of similar goods would exercise
in the custody of them in similar circumstances.
Commingled goods
14
(1)
If authorized by agreement or by custom, a warehouser may mingle
fungible goods with other goods of the same kind and grade.
(2)
If goods are mingled in the manner described in subsection (1), the
holders of the receipts for the mingled goods own the entire mass in
common, and each holder is entitled to the proportion of them that the
quantity shown by each holder's receipt to have been deposited bears
to the whole.
Attachment or levy on goods where negotiable receipt issued
15
If goods are delivered to a warehouser by the owner or person whose
act in conveying the title to them to a purchaser in good faith for
value would bind the owner, and a negotiable receipt is issued for
them, they cannot after that while in the possession of the warehouser
be levied under an execution, unless the receipt is first surrendered
to the warehouser.
Negotiable receipt to state charges for which lien claimed
16
If a negotiable receipt is issued for goods, the warehouser has no
lien on the goods except for charges for storage of those goods after
the date of the receipt, unless the receipt expressly enumerates other
charges for which a lien is claimed.
Perishable and hazardous goods
17
(1)
If goods are of a perishable nature, or by keeping will deteriorate
greatly in value or injure other property, the warehouser may give the
notice that is reasonable and possible under the circumstances to the
holder of the receipt for the goods, if the name and address of the
holder is known to the warehouser or if not known to the warehouser
then to the depositor, requiring that person to satisfy the lien on
the goods and to remove them from the warehouse.
(2)
If the person given notice under subsection (1) fails to satisfy the
lien and remove the goods within the time specified in the notice, the
warehouser may sell the goods at public or private sale without
advertising.
(3)
The notice referred to in subsection (1) may be given by sending it by
registered letter addressed to the person to whom it is to be given at
the person's last known address and the notice is deemed to be given
on the day following the mailing.
(4)
If the warehouser after a reasonable effort is unable to sell the
goods, the warehouser may dispose of them in any manner the warehouser
may think fit, and incurs no liability by that reason.
(5)
From the proceeds of any sale made under this section, the warehouser
must satisfy the lien and must hold the balance in trust for the
holder of the receipt.
Effect of sale
18
If goods have been lawfully sold to satisfy a warehouse lien, or have
been lawfully sold or disposed of under section 17, the
warehouser is not liable for failure to deliver the goods to the
holder of the receipt.
Negotiation of negotiable receipts by delivery and by endorsement
19
(1)
A negotiable receipt may be negotiated by delivery in either of the
following cases:
(a)
if, by the terms of the receipt, the warehouser undertakes to deliver
the goods to the bearer;
(b)
if, by the terms of the receipt, the warehouser undertakes to deliver
the goods to the order of a named person, and that person or a
subsequent endorsee has endorsed it in blank or to bearer.
(2)
A negotiable receipt may be negotiated by the bearer endorsing it to a
named person if
(a)
by the terms of a negotiable receipt, the goods are deliverable to
bearer, or
(b)
a negotiable receipt has been endorsed in blank or to bearer.
(3)
If a negotiable receipt is endorsed under subsection (2), after that
the receipt must be negotiated by the endorsement of the endorsee or a
subsequent endorsee, or by delivery if it is again endorsed in blank
or to bearer.
(4)
If, by the terms of a negotiable receipt, the goods are deliverable to
the order of a named person, the receipt may be negotiated by the
endorsement of that person.
(5)
An endorsement under subsection (4) may be in blank, to bearer or to a
named person, and if the endorsement is to a named person the receipt
may be again negotiated by endorsement in blank, to bearer or to
another named person, and subsequent negotiation may be made in
similar manner.
Transfer receipts
20
A nonnegotiable receipt may be transferred by the holder by delivery
to a purchaser or donee of the goods of a transfer in writing executed
by the holder.
Rights of person to whom receipt has been transferred
21
(1)
A person to whom a nonnegotiable receipt is transferred acquires, as
against the transferor,
(a)
the title to the goods, and
(b)
the right to deposit with the warehouser the transfer or a duplicate
of it.
(2)
On deposit under subsection (1) (b), the transferee acquires the
benefit of the obligation of the warehouser to hold possession of the
goods for the transferee according to the terms of the receipt.
(3)
Before deposit under subsection (1) (b), the title of the transferee
to the goods and the right to acquire the benefit of the obligation of
the warehouser may be defeated by the deposit with the warehouser by
another person of another transfer from the transferor.
Rights in negotiated receipt
22
A person to whom a negotiable receipt is negotiated acquires all of
the following:
(a)
the title to the goods the person negotiating the receipt to the
person had or had ability to transfer to a purchaser in good faith for
valuable consideration;
(b)
the title to the goods the depositor or person to whose order the
goods were to be delivered by the terms of the receipt had or had
ability to transfer to a purchaser in good faith for valuable
consideration;
(c)
the benefit of the obligation of the warehouser to hold possession of
the goods for the person according to the terms of the receipt as
fully as if the warehouser had contracted directly with the person.
Transfer of negotiable receipt without endorsement
23
If a negotiable receipt is transferred for valuable consideration by
delivery, and the endorsement of the transferor is essential for
negotiation, the transferee acquires a right against the transferor to
compel the transferor to endorse the receipt, unless a contrary
intention appears, and the negotiation takes effect as of the time
when the endorsement is made.
Warranties on sale of receipt
24
A person who for valuable consideration negotiates or transfers a
receipt by endorsement or delivery, including one who assigns for
valuable consideration a claim secured by a receipt, unless a contrary
intention appears, warrants all of the following:
(a)
that the receipt is genuine;
(b)
that the person has a legal right to negotiate or transfer it;
(c)
that the person has no knowledge of any fact that would impair the
validity of the receipt;
(d)
that the person has a right to transfer the title to the goods, and
that the goods are merchantable or fit for a particular purpose when
those warranties would have been implied, if the contract of the
parties had been to transfer without a receipt the goods represented
by it.
Endorser not guarantor
25
The endorsement of a receipt does not make the endorser liable for any
failure on the part of the warehouser or previous endorsers of the
receipt to fulfill their respective obligations.
When negotiation not impaired by fraud, mistake or duress
26
The validity of the negotiation of a receipt is not impaired by the
fact that
(a)
the negotiation was a breach of duty on the part of the person making
the negotiation, or
(b)
the owner of the receipt was induced by fraud, mistake or duress to
entrust the possession or custody of the receipt to that person, if
the person to whom the receipt was negotiated, or a person to whom the
receipt was subsequently negotiated, paid value for it without notice
of the breach of duty, or fraud, mistake or duress.
Subsequent negotiation
27
If a person having sold, mortgaged or pledged goods that are in a
warehouse and for which a negotiable receipt has been issued, or
having sold, mortgaged or pledged a negotiable receipt representing
goods, continues in possession of the negotiable receipt, the
subsequent negotiation of it by that person under any sale or other
disposition of it to any person receiving the receipt in good faith,
for valuable consideration and without notice of the previous sale,
mortgage or pledge, has the same effect as if a previous purchaser of
the goods or receipt had expressly authorized the subsequent
negotiation.
Negotiation defeats seller's lien
28
If a negotiable receipt has been issued for goods, no seller's lien or
right of stoppage in transit defeats the rights of a purchaser for
value in good faith to whom the receipt has been negotiated, whether
the negotiation is before or after the notification to the warehouser
who issued the receipt of the seller's claim to a lien or right of
stoppage in transit, and the warehouser must not deliver the goods to
an unpaid seller unless the receipt is first surrendered for
cancellation.
Construction for uniformity of law
29
This Act must be interpreted and construed to effect its general
purpose of making uniform the law of those provinces that enact it.
