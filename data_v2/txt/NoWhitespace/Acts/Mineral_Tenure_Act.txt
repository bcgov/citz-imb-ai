holder until the recorded holder receives the permit, if any, required
under section 10 of the
Mines Act
.

an area in which mining is prohibited under the
Environment and Land Use Act
;
(b)

(ii)
the order under that section making the designation, or an amendment
to the order, precludes the application by the recorded holder;
(e)

If a person holds a mining lease that is located on land that
(a)
is unreserved land owned by the government,
(b)
is not lawfully occupied for a purpose other than for mining, and
(c)
is not protected heritage property.
and the minister certifies that the surface rights are or will be

If an application to acquire surveyed Crown land is received by a
commissioner under the
Land Act
before a claim is located or registered on that land, and the
application results in an acquisition under that Act, the rights with
respect to the acquisition of the surface of the land have priority
over the rights with respect to a claim subsequently located or
registered on that land.
(2)
If an application to acquire unsurveyed Crown land is received by a
commissioner under the
Land Act
and
(a)
staking of the land under that Act for the purpose of the application
is completed before a claim is located or registered on that land, or
(b)
the application results in acquisition under that Act,
the rights with respect to the acquisition of the surface of the land
have priority over the rights with respect to a claim subsequently
located or registered on that land.
(3)
If a disposition is made of surface rights to Crown land, whether
surveyed or unsurveyed, and at the time of disposition there is a
valid mineral title over the Crown land, the disposition of surface
rights does not diminish the rights of the recorded holder except to
the extent otherwise determined
(a)
by order of the chief gold commissioner under section 13,
(b)
by order of the minister under section 17,
(c)
by order of the Surface Rights Board in a settlement under section 19
(4), or

46
(1)
The chief gold commissioner may, by regulation, designate mineral
lands in respect of which placer leases may be issued if satisfied
that the value of the placer minerals in that land warrant the
designation and that the issue of placer leases over them would not be
contrary to the public interest.
(2)
Designated placer land under the former Acts is deemed to be
designated placer lease land under subsection (1) until amended or
revoked by regulation of the chief gold commissioner.
Continuation and amendments of placer leases

If a lessee complies with all prescribed requirements for mapping and
surveying, on application by the lessee the chief gold commissioner
may amend the area of a placer lease by deleting land from it.

If a placer lease is amended under subsection (1), the rental payment
is not reduced until the next year of the lease.

placer lease, the lessee has the right to renew the placer lease for
one further term not exceeding 10 years.
Effect of leases

(1)
[Repealed 2004-22-43.]
(2)
A lease is an interest in land and conveys to the lessee the minerals
or placer minerals, as the case may be, within and under the
leasehold, together with the same rights that the lessee held as the
recorded holder of the claim or group of claims, but is subject to a
valid charge registered against the record of the claim.
(3)
Subject to subsection (2), if a lease is issued over a claim or group
of claims, the title or titles of these claims are extinguished.
Court proceeding to establish adverse claim
49
(1)
If a person claims a right of any kind, either to the minerals or
placer minerals in, or possession of, all or part of a mineral title
which has formed the basis of an application for a lease, that person
must commence a proceeding in the Supreme Court,
(a)
in the case of a claim to minerals, within 80 days after the date of
posting of the notice under section 42, or
(b)
in the case of a claim to placer minerals, within 21 days after the
date of posting of the notice under section 45
unless the court, on being satisfied that the failure to proceed in
time was not within the plaintiff's control, orders otherwise.
(2)
[Repealed 2004-22-44.]
(3)
After the filing of the final court order and after complying with all
survey requirements, the person named in the order as the person
having right to the lease is entitled to the issue of it for all or
part of the claim duly specified in the order.
Rental obligations

placer minerals issued under the former Acts, does not pay the rental
or fails to comply with the provisions of this Act or the regulations
or conditions respecting the lease, the chief gold commissioner must
serve a notice on the holder requiring the holder to comply.
(3)

notice, the lease, if ordered by the chief gold commissioner, forfeits
to and vests in the government as of the date specified in the order.

(a)
a right to a mineral substance that a person acquired under another
enactment before August 15, 1988, or
(b)
an obligation imposed on a person referred to in paragraph (a) in
respect of that mineral substance.
(2)
Subject to subsections (3) and (4) and despite a mineral reserve
having been established under any of the former Acts, a person who,
before August 15, 1988, acquired under another enactment a right to a
mineral substance in mineral lands, has, for as long as the person's
right under the other enactment exists, one of the following exclusive
rights:
(a)
if the right under the other enactment was conferred on the person by
a lease, to have the lease converted into a mining lease in respect of
that mineral substance on application to the chief gold commissioner
in the prescribed form, on payment of the prescribed fee and on
satisfying the chief gold commissioner that the person has
(i)
had the lands surveyed by a British Columbia land surveyor and had the
survey approved by the Surveyor General, and
(ii)
complied with section 42 (1) (c) and (d);
(b)
if the right under the other enactment was conferred on the person by
a permit or a licence, to register a mineral claim over those lands in
respect of that mineral substance.
(3)
The minister may impose terms and conditions in a mining lease
referred to in subsection (2) (a), including terms and conditions that
were contained in the lease under the other enactment.
(4)
A person on whom a right is conferred by subsection (2) must give
written notice to the minister responsible for the administration of
the
Land Act
at least 60 days before the person exercises that right.
(5)
If a person exercises a right conferred on the person by subsection
(2), the right the person acquired and the obligations imposed on the
person in respect of that mineral substance under the other enactment
are extinguished.
(6)
If a right under subsection (2) (a) to have a lease under the
Land Act
converted into a mining lease over mineral lands or a right under
subsection (2) (b) to register a mineral claim in respect of a mineral
substance in mineral lands is not exercised within the applicable
period, the title of the recorded holder of a mineral claim or a
mining lease over those lands includes, on the expiry of that period,
that mineral substance.
(7)
If, by the operation of this section, there is more than one recorded
holder over the same mineral lands and the mineral title of one of the

50 (3) or under a similar provision of any of the former Acts,
(b)
is cancelled by an order under section 40 (7) (b), or
(c)
is surrendered or abandoned under section 6.33,
(d)
[Repealed 2004-22-47.]
then, despite the

holder immediately after the forfeiture, cancellation or surrender of
the title or after the expiry of the period referred to in paragraph
(d), as the case may be.
(8)
If
(a)
by the operation of this section there is more than one recorded
holder over the same mineral lands,

the mineral title of one of the recorded holders referred to in
paragraph (a) escheats to the government otherwise than by a
forfeiture referred to in subsection (7) (a), and
(c)
no assignment of the escheated mineral title is made under
section 8 of the
Escheat Act
within one year after the date the escheat occurs,
the rights under the mineral title referred to in paragraph (b) vest
on the expiry of that year in the other recorded holder and the chief
gold commissioner may discharge the registration of the recorded
holder whose mineral title has escheated.
(9)
Where a person is, before December 1, 1995, the recorded holder of a
mineral claim or a mining lease over mineral lands and no person has,
before that date, acquired under another enactment a right to a
mineral substance within those lands, the title of the recorded holder
includes all minerals, as defined in this Act, within those lands.
