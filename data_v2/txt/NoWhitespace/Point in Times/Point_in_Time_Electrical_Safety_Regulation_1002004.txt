The object of bonding is to have an impedance sufficiently low in
order to
(a) facilitate the operation of the overcurrent devices in the
circuit on the occurrence of a fault of negligible impedance from an
energized or phase conductor to exposed metal, and
(b) limit the duration of the voltage above ground on this exposed
metal. This object is accomplished by means of completing the fault
path of the bonding arrangement of the consumer's installation which
would normally have to be such that a current of not less than 5
times the rating of the overcurrent device protecting the circuit
will flow on the occurrence of a fault of negligible impedance via a
bonding conductor back to the solidly ground source.
