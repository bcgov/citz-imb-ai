Part 28 — Replotting Schemes
Division 1 — Interpretation
Definitions
982
For the purposes of this Part:
"common mass"
means the common mass of property referred to in section 986 (1);
"district"
means a part of a municipality defined by the council under
section 984;
"former parcel"
means a parcel existing before the completion of a replotting
scheme, and includes any portion of land formerly a portion of a
highway, park or public square, or of land indicated as such on a
plan of subdivision deposited in the land title office;
"new parcel"
means a parcel created or intended to be created by a replotting
scheme, and includes a portion of land created or intended to be
created as a portion of a highway, park or public square, or of
land indicated as such on a plan of subdivision deposited in the
land title office under this Part;
"owner"
means a purchaser of real property under an unregistered agreement
for sale and purchase, a registered owner of an estate in fee
simple, a registered owner of a charge or a tax sale purchaser
during the redemption period, and includes the Provincial
government, a Provincial government corporation and the
municipality.
Application of Part
983
(1)
This Part applies to Crown land in a district held by purchasers
from the Provincial government and in that case both the
Provincial government and the purchasers are deemed to be owners
for the purposes of this Part.
(2)
[Repealed 1997-25-152.]
Division 2 — Preparation and Initiation of Scheme
Preliminary definition of district
984
A council may, by bylaw adopted by an affirmative vote of at least
2/3 of all its members,
(a)
define a part of the municipality as a district for the purpose of
replotting, and
(b)
authorize the preparation of a scheme, including incidental
preliminary surveys, for the replotting of the district.
Information included in scheme
985
(1)
A replotting scheme must indicate the following:
(a)
the proposed relocation and exchange of parcels of real property
in which the Provincial government or the municipality has no
estate or interest;
(b)
whether compensation is to be proposed to the respective owners
and its amount;
(c)
the value of any surplus real property;
(d)
the new location of a building, structure, erection or utility
that is to be moved.
(2)
A replotting scheme may set out an apportionment of the net cost
of the scheme between the municipality and the owners,
consideration being given to
(a)
the saving that the scheme may effect in the expenditure of the
municipality for highways and municipal utilities, and
(b)
the increased taxation that may be derived by the municipality
from the increased value of the real property in the district.
(3)
An apportionment under subsection (2) may or may not be as
provided by section 1011.
General principles of replotting
986
(1)
For the purpose of a replotting scheme, all the parcels and
highways and all other real property in the district at the
initiation of the scheme form one common mass of real property.
(2)
From the common mass is to be taken the real property necessary
for highways, parks or public squares, which stands in the place
of and compensates the Provincial government, the municipality and
the public for the surrender of all former highways, parks or
public squares.
(3)
The remainder of the common mass must be divided into parcels for
allotment to the owners in a fair and equitable manner, so that as
far as possible the value of new parcels allotted to them are
equal to the value of their former parcels.
(4)
An allotment, decision, award, consent or other proceeding under
this Part is binding on and inures to the benefit of the person
who owns the real property affected.
Reallotment of parcels
987
(1)
In a replotting,
(a)
effort must be made to allot to owners new parcels in
approximately the same location as their former parcels, and
(b)
parcels with buildings, structures, erections or utilities erected
on them, subject to the necessary adjustment of boundaries, must
be returned to their former owners wherever practicable.
(2)
The allotment of new parcels in exchange for former parcels must
be carried out as far as practicable with the consent of the
respective owners.
(3)
Failing consent of an owner, there may be allotted to the owner a
new parcel or parcels of value equal as nearly as possible to the
value of the owner's former parcel or parcels, or compensation in
money may be made to the owner instead of an allotment of real
property.
(4)
Unavoidable differences of value between former parcels and new
parcels may be equalized by
(a)
granting money compensation, or
(b)
with the owner's consent or agreement, allotting to the owner of a
new parcel of greater value than the owner's former parcel for a
cash payment or on terms.
(5)
If a new parcel is allotted under subsection (4) (b) on terms, the
municipality may take a mortgage, with agreed interest, from the
owner for payment of the difference in value.
(6)
Any real property not allotted as provided above may be allotted
to any owner at an agreed price, the amount of which must be paid
to the municipality.
(7)
The whole of the real property remaining unallotted must be
allotted to the municipality and is surplus real property.
Municipality may acquire charges
988
Subject to making compensation for a charge against a former
parcel, the municipality may
(a)
acquire such a charge and hold it as a charge against a new parcel
allotted to the owner of the former parcel, and
(b)
take all necessary proceedings for the collection of the amount
due under and by virtue of the charge or for the sale, transfer or
realization of the security created by it.
Notice requirements for initiation of a scheme
989
(1)
Before initiating a replotting scheme, the council must have
