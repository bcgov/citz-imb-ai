If the city as purchaser at a tax sale becomes the registered

default in the payment of principal, interest, taxes, or other
charges due thereunder, the city need not bring an action to

at the address given in the agreement referring to this section
and demanding payment of the amount in default to the city within
ninety days from the giving of the notice and warning the
purchaser that upon his failure to remedy the default within the
said ninety days, he and those claiming under or through him will
forfeit any interest in the said parcel, together with any sums
theretofore paid to the city under the agreement. If the purchaser
fails to remedy the default within the said period of ninety days,
all the right, title, and interest of the purchaser under the
agreement, and all those claiming under or through him, shall, at
the expiration of such period, absolutely cease and determine, and
the parcel shall immediately become revested in the city, free
from all claims by the purchaser, or anyone claiming under or
through him, and, notwithstanding any Statute or rule of law or
equity to the contrary, all payments made to the city under the
said agreement shall be forfeited to the city. The city may file
with the Registrar of Land Titles a statutory declaration proving
such resolution, the giving of the notice, and the continued
default, and thereupon the Registrar shall cancel any charge or
encumbrance registered against the parcel in respect of the
agreement.

Where any parcel becomes revested in the city under subsection
(1), the city may cause notice to be given to any occupant of such
parcel requiring him to vacate forthwith and giving to him four
weeks' notice of the city's intention to sue out a writ of
possession of such parcel in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia, and unless within such four weeks the occupant vacates
the parcel or registers a certificate of pending litigation
against the parcel, the city shall, without any order for that
purpose, be entitled to sue out such writ of possession on filing
with the District Registrar of the Court an affidavit proving
service of the notice and failure to vacate.
