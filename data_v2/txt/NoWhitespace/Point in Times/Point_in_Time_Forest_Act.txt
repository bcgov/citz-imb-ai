=

=

harvest under the licence after the reduction under section
63 of the allowable annual cut authorized in the licence

the allowable annual cut authorized in the licence after the
reduction under section 63 of the allowable annual cut
authorized in the licence.

up under subsection (2) (b), the allowable annual cut for the last
year of the licence must be determined by multiplying the NAAC
determined under subsection (3) by the fraction.
(5)
This section does not apply to the holder of a licence if the
notice under section 63 is sent to the holder after the total
volume authorized under the licence has been harvested.

proportionately among them according to the relative sizes of the
allowable annual cut specified in each licence;
(b)
second, calculate for each licence the annual volume of timber, if
any, by which the calculations under this subsection reduce the

allowable annual cut;
(c)
third, calculate the aggregate of the annual volumes of timber
calculated under paragraph (b);
(d)
fourth, for each licence for which the calculation under paragraph
(b) does not reduce the allowable annual cut to less than the
base-level allowable annual cut, calculate a further reduction in
allowable annual cut by distributing the amount determined under
paragraph (c) proportionately among those licences according to
the relative sizes of the allowable annual cut specified in each
of them;
(e)
fifth, repeat the calculations under paragraphs (b) to (d) until
the end result of all the calculations is that the allowable
annual cut for any of the licences is not reduced to a level that
is less than the base-level allowable annual cut.

base level allowable annual cut, or
(b) is for a term that is less than the prescribed term.
(4)  A reduction in allowable annual cut imposed under
subsection (2) (a) in a timber supply area must be apportioned
among all the licences in that area, except exempt licences, in
accordance with the following method:
(a) first, calculate a reduction in allowable annual cut for
each licence by distributing the part of the reduction under
subsection (1) (a) that the minister may assign to the licences
proportionately among them according to the relative sizes of the
allowable annual cut specified in each licence;
(b) second, calculate for each licence the annual volume of
timber, if any, by which the calculations under this subsection
reduce the allowable annual cut for that licence to less than the
base level allowable annual cut;
(c) third, calculate the aggregate of the annual volumes of
timber calculated under paragraph (b);
(d) fourth, for each licence for which the calculation under
paragraph (b) does not reduce the allowable annual cut to less
than the base level allowable annual cut, calculate a further
reduction in allowable annual cut by distributing the amount
determined under paragraph (c) proportionately among those
licences according to the relative sizes of the allowable annual
cut specified in each of them;
(e) fifth, repeat the calculations under paragraphs (b) to
(d) until the end result of all the calculations is that the
allowable annual cut for any of the licences is not reduced to a
level that is less than the base level allowable annual cut.
(5)  The minister or the chief forester, as the case may be,
must serve a copy of an order made under this section on the
holder of an agreement listed in section 12 to which the order
relates, but the order is not invalid only because it is not
served.
(6)  A reduction in an allowable annual cut under subsection
(2) does not constitute a determination of an allowable annual cut
for the purposes of the time limits set out in section 8 (1) and
(2).
(7)  Section 8 (8) does not apply to a reduction of an
allowable annual cut under this section.
