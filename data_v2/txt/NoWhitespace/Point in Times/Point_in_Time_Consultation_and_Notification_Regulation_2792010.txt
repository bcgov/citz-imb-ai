AOF test value has not been determined, a theoretical AOF must be
calculated using the following formula:

maximum H
2
S concentrations for each H
2
S-bearing formation must be determined for each of at least 5 wells
drilled and tested in an analogous geological area or pool within 5
kilometres of the proposed well.
4. The H
2
S release rates for all potential H
2
S-bearing formations in the proposed well must be determined based
on the highest AOF and highest H
2
S concentration for each formation and the sum of the H
2
S release rates for all the formations that will be open to the well
bore during drilling operations.
5. If appropriate data does not exist or is otherwise inadequate,
the consultation and notification radius is 3 km from the proposed
well or well site.
Completion or re-completion operations
For completion or re-completion operations in an existing well, data
from the appropriate formation in the well must be used to determine
H

S release rates, but if the appropriate data does not exist or is
otherwise inadequate, H
2
S release rates must determined in accordance with the equations and
notes set out above for drilling operations.
