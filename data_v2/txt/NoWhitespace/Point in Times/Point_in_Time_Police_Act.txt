may, until the completion of that investigation, reassign or
suspend the person with his or her pay, if
(a) the discipline authority considers that
(i)  reassignment or suspension of the person is needed to
protect municipal constables or other persons from the risk of
harm,
(ii)  failure to reassign or suspend the person is likely to
bring the reputation of the municipal police department as a whole

constable, chief constable or deputy chief constable, as the case
may be, and that person may, within 10 business days after
