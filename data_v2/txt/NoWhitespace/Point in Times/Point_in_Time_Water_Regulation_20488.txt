(a)
set the duration of the ordinary rental period of the licence for
a period of 3 years, and

located in different regions but the total amount of annual
rentals for the purposes of subsection (4) is or would be $60 or
less, subsection (4) applies and the comptroller must administer
the licences for rental billing purposes as if all of the licences
related to land located in only one of the regions.
(6)
If a licence referred to in subsection (4) is transferred to a new
owner and the land to which it is appurtenant is situated in a
different region than the region chosen as the administrative

If, for the purposes of subsection (12) the comptroller makes an
adjustment of the rental for a licence resulting in a higher

additional rental prorated for the balance of the appropriate
rental period taking into account whether the total annual
rentals, including the additional rental, are or would be $60 or
less.
(14)
If, for the purposes of subsection (12) the comptroller makes an

report on its consumption of water for the previous calendar year.
(3)
Where a report required under subsection (2) has not been filed by
the time the rental is to be calculated or the comptroller
considers that an accurate measurement of the water diverted is
not available, he may determine the quantity of water which has
been used, based
(a)
for waterworks purposes, on rates of consumption per person served
or per connection, and
(b)
for irrigation purposes, on irrigation water applied per acre,
that he considers reflect an average for the climatic area
concerned.
Unauthorized diversion or works

15
(1)
The categories of power use are as follows:
(a)
"residential"
means a power use where the capacity and energy generated from a

licensee, including the requirements of any outbuildings, and may
also be used in part to participate in the BC Hydro Net Metering
Program;
(b)
"commercial"
means a power use other than residential where the capacity and
energy generated from a power development or developments owned by
the licensee, or the entitlement to capacity and energy derived

immediate family members, employees or tenants of the licensee
where the licensee's power development or developments does not
exceed an authorized capacity of 499 kW,
(ii)
is used for the extraction or processing of natural resources, or
the manufacturing of products, in a primary industrial facility in
which the licensee has an interest of more than 50%, or
(iii)
is used in a facility that is adjacent to and integrated with a
primary industrial facility in which the licensee has an interest

energy used in the adjacent and integrated facility is for the
production of output consumed in or for the use of the industrial
processes of the licensee;
(c)
"general"
means
(i)
a power use where the capacity and energy generated is from a
power development or developments owned by a public utility
regulated by the British Columbia Utilities Commission under

development or developments exceeds that necessary to supply the

(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1) (b) (iii), the licensee must be

for the disposition of capacity and energy to the adjacent and
integrated facility.
[en. B.C. Reg. 154/94, s. 2; am. B.C. Reg. 195/2009, s. (a).]
Determination of fees, rentals and charges
16
(1)
The application fee for a licence for power purpose shall be based
on:
(a)
the intended capacity, if the applicant intends to install
generating equipment;
(b)
the anticipated additional output produced in a single normal year
at all sites where the water is to be used, if the applicant does
not intend to install generating equipment.
(2)
The comptroller may determine the fees, rentals and charges using
(a)
records of operation submitted by the licensee of the power
development,
(a.1)
power sales records of the licensee and power consumption and
output records of adjacent and integrated facilities, necessary to
determine that all or any part of the capacity and output of a
power development or developments should be charged under the
commercial power use category described in section 15 (1) (b)
(iii),
(b)
information obtained by an inspection pursuant to section 22
of the Act, and
(c)
other relevant evidence.
(3)
Annual rentals shall be determined at the appropriate rates
according to the categories of power use.

rental charges at the rates for the calendar year when the
determination is made, with the charge or charges being based on
(a)
the licensee's construction capacity, if any,
(b)
the balance of the authorized capacity other than construction
capacity, and
(c)
subject to subsection (5), the total of the output from all power
developments owned or operated by a single licensee during the
preceding calendar year.
(4.1)
The comptroller must use the amount of capacity and output
assessed to a licensee at the commercial power use rate as the
base from which the capacity and output charges under the general
power use rate will be determined under subsection (4).
(5)
Where output transfers in accordance with sections 19 and 23
have taken place during the calendar year immediately preceding
the calendar year of a determination under subsection (4),
the total of the output referred to in
subsection (4) (c) shall be adjusted to reflect the
requirements of sections 19 and 23.
[am. B.C. Reg. 154/94, s. 3.]
First annual rental — when due
17

licence, whichever occurs first.
Rate adjustments in certain circumstances
18
(1)

of the powerplant from service for replacement of a substantial
portion thereof in order to improve the unit's efficiency,
(a)
he shall notify the comptroller of his intention,
(b)
during the period of replacement, rentals payable on the said unit
shall be charged at the rate for construction capacity, and
(c)
if the replacement unit is of a greater capacity than the previous
one, but uses no more water, the authorized capacity on which
rentals shall be charged shall change on the day that the unit
recommences operation.
(2)
Subsection (1) does not apply to the removal or replacement of a
unit as part of routine maintenance.
(3)
When construction capacity becomes operational, the rental rate to
be charged shall change, with effect from the day on which the
capacity becomes operational.
(4)
Where all or part of the authorized capacity is not electrical in
nature, the electrical equivalents for capacity and output may be
determined, for rental purposes, by assuming that one kilowatt is
equal to 1.341286 horsepower.
Additional fees in respect of certain downstream benefits
19
(1)
In this section
"downstream owner"
means an owner, part owner or operator of a downstream plant
outside the Province.
(2)
Subject to subsection (8), where the holder of a licence for
storage purposes

downstream hydro-electric plant outside the Province to generate
greater amounts of electricity than the level it could generate if
the storage facilities were not so operated, and

then, in addition to any fees, rentals or charges payable by the
licensee for storage purpose under any other section of this
regulation, he shall pay the fees determined under this section.

determined at the appropriate rate for annual rentals upon output.
(4)
The rate for output shall be the higher of

(4)
The fact that a diversion or use of water from a stream meets the
requirements of subsection (1) does not relieve the person who
diverts or uses the water from

conservation of fish or wildlife or other environmental values,
(ii)
for a conservation purpose, or
(iii)

time in the year in which the diversion or use can proceed without
causing harm to fish, wildlife or habitat.
(2)
A person who diverts or uses water from a stream under section 47
must do so in a manner that does not cause damage to fish,
wildlife or habitat, and, for that purpose, must ensure that the

stream from which the water was diverted, or
(ii)
in a manner that causes
(A)
damage from erosion or scour to the stream from which the water
was diverted, the stream channel or any works in that stream or
stream channel,

damage to the stable natural materials and vegetation in and about
that stream, or
