Depreciation of Dams Power Plants

[includes amendments up to B.C. Reg. 243/2014, December 22, 2014]
Definitions
1
In this regulation:
"Act"
means the
Assessment Act
;
"chronological age"
means the number of years determined by subtracting from the year
in which the new assessment roll is completed
(a)
the year in which the electrical power generating facility first
commenced operation, or
(b)
in the case of an improvement or part of an improvement that was
constructed or installed after the electrical power generating
facility commenced operation, the year in which the construction
or installation of the improvement or part of it was completed;
"effective age"
means the number of years determined by
(a)
calculating the total cost of the electrical power generating
facility improvement,
(b)
multiplying the chronological age of each part of the improvement
by the cost of that part to give the weighted age of that part,
(c)
adding the weighted ages of all of the parts of the improvement,
and
(d)
dividing the sum of the weighted ages by the total cost of the
improvements and rounding the quotient up to the next whole year
to yield the effective age;
"electrical power generating facility"
means a dam, power plant or substation, each as defined in
section 20.1 of the
Assessment Act
, but does not include an industrial improvement as defined in
section 20 of the
Assessment Act
;
"wind power plant"
means a power plant that uses a wind turbine to generate or supply
electricity from the wind.
[am. B.C. Reg. 192/2011, s. 1.]
Determining depreciation
2
(1)
For the purposes of section 20.1 of the Act,
(a)
dam and power plant improvements must be depreciated according to
the following formula:
depreciation = annual depreciation rate x age
where
(i)
"annual depreciation rate" is the percentage rate set out in
Schedule A or B for the category of improvement within a dam
or power plant, and
(ii)
"age" is the chronological age or, if parts of an improvement have
different chronological ages, the effective age of the
improvement, and
(b)
substation improvements must be depreciated according to the
following formula:
depreciation = depreciation percentage x age
where
(i)
"depreciation percentage" is the rate set out in Schedule C
for a specified age of a substation, and
(ii)
"age" is the chronological age or, if parts of an improvement have
different chronological ages, the effective age of the
improvement.
(2)
Despite subsection (1) and section 3, the costs of the
improvements at each of the following locations must be reduced by
15% before application of the depreciation determined otherwise
under this regulation:
(a)
Lower Bonnington Plant #1;
(b)
Upper Bonnington Plant #2;
(c)
South Slocan Plant #3;
(d)
Corra Linn Plant #4.
(3)
Despite subsection (1) and sections 3 and 4, the depreciation to
be applied to the following must be determined by the assessor
using generally accepted appraisal methods:
(a)
dam improvements, if the dam has an actual electrical power
generating capacity of 6 or less megawatts per hour;
(b)
improvements not specifically described in Schedule A, B or C.
(4)
Despite subsection (1) and section 3, if the assessor determines,
as of October 31 of any year, that an electrical transformer
within a substation has a design capacity that is at least 100%
greater than the peak megavolt amp load requirement of that
transformer during the previous 12 months, the cost of that
transformer must be reduced by 25% before application of the
depreciation determined otherwise under this regulation for
valuation of that transformer for the next assessment roll.
(5)
Subsection (4) applies only if a transformer is installed to
service a load requirement or anticipated load requirement, and,
subsequent to the installation,
(a)
the load requirement diminishes, or
(b)
the anticipated load requirement does not occur.
[am. B.C. Regs. 295/2001, s. 1; 365/2002, s. 1.]
Maximum depreciation
3
If the depreciation determined under section 2 for an electrical
power generating facility improvement is equal to or in excess of
the maximum depreciation set out in Schedule A, B or C for that
type of improvement, then the depreciation for that improvement is
the maximum allowed for that type of improvement.
Closure allowances
4
(1)
If the assessor determines
(a)
that an electrical power generating facility is closed on or
before October 31 of any year and the owner of the facility
or a senior executive officer of the corporation that owns the
facility confirms in writing that the closure is permanent, or
(b)
that an electrical power generating facility has been closed for a
minimum of 3 consecutive years immediately preceding
October 31 in any year and the owner of the facility or a
senior executive officer of the corporation that owns the facility
confirms in writing the fact that the facility is closed and the
duration of that closure,
then, for the purposes of the assessment roll in the succeeding
year, the depreciation applicable to improvements that are part of
the electrical power generating facility is the amount that is
sufficient to reduce the actual value of the improvements to 10%
of the cost of the improvements.
(2)
If the assessor determines that
(a)
a separate improvement within an electrical power generating
facility is permanently closed or shut down on or before
October 31 in any year and the owner or facility manager of
the facility confirms in writing that the closure or shut down is
permanent, or
(b)
a separate improvement within a facility has been closed or shut
down for a minimum of 3 consecutive years immediately preceding
October 31 in any year and the owner or facility manager
confirms in writing the fact that the improvement is closed or
shut down and the duration of that closure or shut down,
then, for the purpose of the assessment roll in the succeeding
year, the depreciation applicable to the separate improvement is
the amount that is sufficient to reduce the actual value of the
improvement to 10% of the cost of the separate improvement.
(2.1)
In addition to the requirements under subsection (1) or (2), a
confirmation under this section must
(a)
be made to the assessor of the assessment area in which the
electrical power generating facility or separate improvement
within an electrical power generating facility is located,
(b)
be made by the November 30 next following the October 31 referred
to in subsections (1) or (2),
(c)
in the case of subsection (1) (a) or (2) (a), specify the date of
the permanent closure or shutdown, and
(d)
in the case of subsection (1) (b) or (2) (b), specify the
commencement date and duration of the closure or shutdown
in order to be effective for the following tax year.
(3)
Subsection (2) applies only with respect to a complete improvement
and must not be applied to a part of an improvement.
(4)
If a previously closed electrical power generating facility or
improvement is reopened or reactivated, this section ceases to
apply for the purposes of the assessment roll in the succeeding
year and depreciation must be determined in accordance with
sections 2 and 3.
(5)
Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 365/2002, s. 2 (b).]
[am. B.C. Reg. 365/2002, s. 2.]
Rounding down amounts
5
The assessment authority may round the amount of depreciated value
calculated under section 2 or 3
(a)
down to the nearest $100, if the value determined is greater than
$101 and less than $99 999, and
(b)
down to the nearest $1 000, if the value determined is
$100 000 or greater.
