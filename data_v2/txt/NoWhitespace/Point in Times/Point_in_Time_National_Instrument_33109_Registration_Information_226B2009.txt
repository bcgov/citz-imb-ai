— The amount on this line must be not less than (a) $25,000 for an
adviser, (b) $50,000 for a dealer, and (c) $100,000 for an
investment fund manager.
Line 9. Market Risk
— The amount on this line must be calculated according to the
instructions set out in Schedule 1 to this Form.
Line 11. Guarantees
— If the registered firm is guaranteeing the liability of another
party, the total amount of the guarantee must be included in the
capital calculation. If the amount of a guarantee is included in the
firm's balance sheet as a current liability and is reflected in line
4, do not include the amount of the guarantee on line 11.
Line 12. Unresolved differences
— Any unresolved differences that could result in a loss from either
firm or client assets must be included in the capital calculation.
The examples below are intended to provide guidance as to how to
calculate unresolved differences:
(i) If there is an unresolved difference relating to client
securities, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to
the market value of the client securities that are short, plus the
applicable margin rate for those securities.
(ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the
registrant's investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will
be equal to the market value of the investments (securities) that
are short.
(iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the
amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the
shortfall in cash.

use to prepare your financial statements in accordance with National
Instrument 52-107
Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards
. Section 12.1 of Companion Policy 31-103CP
Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant
Obligations
provides further guidance in respect of these accounting principles.
Line 5. Related-party debt
— Refer to the CICA Handbook for the definition of "related party"
for publicly accountable enterprises.
Line 8. Minimum Capital
— The amount on this line must be not less than (a) $25,000 for an
adviser and (b) $50,000 for a dealer. For an investment fund
manager, the amount must be not less than $100,000 unless subsection

Line 9. Market Risk
— The amount on this line must be calculated according to the
instructions set out in Schedule 1 to this Form.
Line 11. Guarantees
— If the registered firm is guaranteeing the liability of another
party, the total amount of the guarantee must be included in the
capital calculation. If the amount of a guarantee is included in the
firm's statement of financial position as a current liability and is
reflected in line 4, do not include the amount of the guarantee on
line 11.
Line 12. Unresolved differences
— Any unresolved differences that could result in a loss from either
firm or client assets must be included in the capital calculation.
The examples below provide guidance as to how to calculate

securities, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to
the fair value of the client securities that are short, plus the
applicable margin rate for those securities.
(ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the
registrant's investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will
be equal to the fair value of the investments (securities) that are
short.
(iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the
amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the
shortfall in cash.
Please refer to section 12.1 of Companion Policy 31-103CP

Instrument 52-107
Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards
. Section 12.1 of Companion Policy 31-103CP
Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant

regulator or, in Québec, the securities regulatory authority on the
earlier of (a) 10 days after the date the agreement is executed or
(b) the date an amount subordinated by the agreement is excluded
from its calculation of excess working capital on Form 31-103F1
Calculation of Excess Working Capital
.
The firm must notify the regulator or, in Québec, the securities

the fair value of the client securities that are short, plus the
applicable margin rate for those securities.
(ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the
registrant's investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will
be equal to the fair value of the investments (securities) that are
short.
(iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the
amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the
shortfall in cash.

same categories or reinstate their same status of permitted

with their former sponsoring firm did not end because the individual
was asked by the firm to resign, resigned voluntarily or was
dismissed, following an allegation against the individual of
criminal activity, a breach of securities legislation, or a breach
of the rules of an SRO.
If you do not meet all of the above conditions then you must apply
