Signature of Person Completing this Form
Schedule 2
Personal Information Collection Policy
The regulators listed in Schedule 3 Regulators collect the personal
information in Schedule 1
Personal Information Form
under the authority granted to them under provincial and territorial
securities legislation. Under securities legislation, the regulators
do not make any of the information provided in Schedule 1 public.
The regulators collect the personal information in Schedule 1 for
the purpose of enabling the regulators to administer and enforce
provincial and territorial securities legislation, including those
provisions that require or permit the regulators to refuse to issue
a receipt for a prospectus if it appears to the regulators that the
past conduct of management or promoters of the Issuer affords
reasonable grounds for belief that the business of the Issuer will
not be conducted with integrity and in the best interests of its
securityholders.
You understand that by signing the certificate and consent in
Schedule 1, you are consenting to the Issuer submitting your
personal information in Schedule 1 (the "Information") to the
regulators and to the collection and use by the regulators of the
Information, as well as any other information that may be necessary
to administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities
legislation. This may include the collection of information from law
enforcement agencies, other government or non-governmental
regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations, exchanges,
and quotation and trade reporting systems in order to conduct
background checks, verify the Information and perform investigations
and conduct enforcement proceedings as required to ensure compliance
with provincial and territorial securities legislation.
You understand that the Issuer is required to deliver the
Information to the regulators because the Issuer has filed a
prospectus under provincial and territorial securities legislation.
You also understand that you have a right to be informed of the
existence of personal information about you that is kept by
regulators, that you have the right to request access to that
information, and that you have the right to request that such
information be corrected, subject to the applicable provisions of
the freedom of information and protection of privacy legislation
adopted by each province and territory.
You also understand and agree that the Information the regulators
collect about you may also be disclosed, as permitted by law, where
its use and disclosure is for the purposes described above. The
regulators may also use a third party to process the Information,
but when this happens, the third party will be carefully selected
and obligated to comply with the limited use restrictions described
above and with provincial and federal privacy legislation.
Warning:
It is an offence to submit information that, in a material respect
and at the time and in the light of the circumstances in which it is
submitted, is misleading or untrue.
Questions
If you have any questions about the collection, use, and disclosure
of the information you provide to the regulators, you may contact
the regulator in the jurisdiction in which the required information
is filed, at the address or telephone number listed in Schedule 3.

(15) BEFORE amended by BC Reg 382/2010, effective January 1, 2011.
(

)
In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of
materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgment
in the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to
an Item 's significance to investors, analysts and other users of
the information. An Item of information, or an aggregate of items,
is considered material if it is probable that its omission or
misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with
respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether
information is material, take into account both quantitative and
qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be
considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items
have an offsetting effect. This concept of materiality is
consistent with the financial reporting notion of materiality
contained in the Handbook.
(
7
)
Where the term "issuer" is used, it may be necessary, in order to
meet the requirement for full, true and plain disclosure of all
material facts, to also include disclosure with respect to persons
or companies that the issuer is required, under the issuer's GAAP,
to consolidate, proportionately consolidate or account for using
the equity method (for example, including "subsidiaries" as that
term is used in the Handbook). If it is more likely than not that
a person or company will become an entity that the issuer will be
required, under the issuer's GAAP, to consolidate, proportionately
consolidate or account for using the equity method, it may be
necessary to also include disclosure with respect to the person or
company.
(
8
)
An issuer that is a special purpose vehicle may have to modify the
disclosure items to reflect the special purpose nature of its
business.
(
10
)
If an issuer discloses financial information in a preliminary
prospectus or prospectus in a currency other than the Canadian
dollar, prominently disclose the currency in which the financial
information is disclosed.
(
15
)
Forward-looking information, as defined in NI 51-102, included in
a prospectus must comply with section 4A.2 of NI 51-102 and must
include the disclosure described in section 4A.3 of NI 51-102. In
addition to the foregoing, FOFI or a financial outlook, each as
defined in NI 51-102, included in a prospectus must comply with
Part 4B of NI 51-102. If the forward-looking information relates
to an issuer or other entity that is not a reporting issuer in any
jurisdiction, section 4A.2, section 4A.3 and Part 4B of NI 51-102
apply as if the issuer or other entity were a reporting issuer in
at least one jurisdiction.
Form 41-101F1, General Instructions item (16) was added by BC Reg
197/2013, effective August 13, 2013.
Form 41-101F1, section 1.4 (2) BEFORE amended by BC Reg 178/2013,
effective May 14, 2013.
(2)  If there may be an over allocation position,
(a) disclose that a purchaser who acquires securities forming
part of the underwriters' over-allocation position acquires those
securities under this prospectus, regardless of whether the
over-allocation position is ultimately filled through the exercise
of the over-allotment option or secondary market purchases, and
(b) describe the terms of any over-allotment option or an
option to increase the size of the distribution before closing.
Form 41-101F1, section 1.4 (2.1) was added by BC Reg 178/2013,

(
2
)
Earnings coverage is calculated by dividing an entity's earnings
(the numerator) by its interest and dividend obligations (the
denominator).
(
3
)
For the earnings coverage calculation
(
a
)
the numerator should be calculated using consolidated net income
before interest and income taxes;
(
b
)
imputed interest income from the proceeds of a distribution should
not be added to the numerator;
(
c
)
an issuer may also present, as supplementary disclosure, a
coverage calculation based on earnings before discontinued
operations and extraordinary items;
(
d
)
for distributions of debt securities, the appropriate denominator
is interest expense determined in accordance with the issuer's
GAAP, after giving effect to the new debt issue and any retirement
of obligations, plus the amount of interest that has been
capitalized during the period;
(
e
)
for distributions of preferred shares
(
i
)
the appropriate denominator is dividends declared during the
period, together with undeclared dividends on cumulative preferred
shares, after giving effect to the new preferred share issue, plus
the issuer's annual interest requirements, including the amount of
interest that has been capitalized during the period, less any
retirement of obligations, and
(
ii
)
dividends should be grossed-up to a before-tax equivalent using
the issuer's effective income tax rate; and
(
f
)
for distributions of both debt securities and preferred shares,
the appropriate denominator is the same as for a preferred share
issue, except that the denominator should also reflect the effect
of the debt being offered pursuant to the prospectus.
(
4
)
The denominator represents a pro forma calculation of the
aggregate of an issuer's interest obligations on all long-term
debt and dividend obligations (including both dividends declared
and undeclared dividends on cumulative preferred shares) with
respect to all outstanding preferred shares, as adjusted to
reflect
(
a
)
the issuance of all long-term debt and, in addition in the case of
an issuance of preferred shares, all preferred shares issued,
since the date of the annual or interim financial statements;
(
b
)
the issuance of the securities that are to be distributed under
the prospectus, based on a reasonable estimate of the price at
which these securities will be distributed;
(
c
)
the repayment or redemption of all long-term debt since the date
of the annual or interim financial statements, all long-term debt
to be repaid or redeemed from the proceeds to be realized from the
sale of securities under the prospectus and, in addition, in the
case of an issuance of preferred shares, all preferred shares
repaid or redeemed since the date of the annual or interim
financial statements and all preferred shares to be repaid or
redeemed from the proceeds to be realized from the sale of
securities under the prospectus; and
(
d
)
the servicing costs that were incurred, or will be incurred, in
relation to the above adjustments.
(
5
)
In certain circumstances, debt obligations may be classified as
current liabilities because such obligations, by their terms, are
due on demand, are due within one year, or are callable by the
creditor. If the issuer is distributing, or has outstanding, debt
securities that are classified as current liabilities, disclose
(
a
)
in the notes to the ratios required under subsection 9.1 (1) that
the ratios have been calculated excluding the carrying charges for
those debt securities reflected as current liabilities;
(
b
)
that if those debt securities had been classified in their
entirety as long term debt for the purposes of calculating the
ratios under subsection 9.1 (1), the entire amount of the annual
carrying charges for such debt securities would have been
reflected in the calculation of the issuer's interest and dividend
obligations; and
(
c
)
the earnings coverage ratios for the periods referred to in
subsection 9.1 (1), calculated as though those debt securities had
been classified as long term debt.
(
6
)
For debt securities, disclosure of earnings coverage shall include
language similar to the following, with the bracketed and bulleted
information completed:
"[Name of the issuer]'s interest requirements, after giving effect
to the issue of [the debt securities to be distributed under the
prospectus], amounted to $• for the 12 months ended •. [Name of
the issuer]'s earnings before interest and income tax for the 12

include language similar to the following, with the bracketed and
bulleted information completed:
"[Name of the issuer]'s dividend requirements on all of its
preferred shares, after giving effect to the issue of [the
preferred shares to be distributed under the prospectus], and
adjusted to a before-tax equivalent using an effective income tax
rate of •%, amounted to $• for the 12 months ended •. [Name of the
issuer]'s interest requirements for the 12 months then ended
amounted to $•. [Name of the issuer]'s earnings before interest
and income tax for the 12 months ended • was $•, which is • times
[name of the issuer]'s aggregate dividend and interest
requirements for this period."

the commodity pool] can be substantial. In considering whether to
participate in the [commodity pool], you should be aware that
trading [nature of instruments] can quickly lead to large losses as
well as gains. Such trading losses can sharply reduce the net asset
value of the [commodity pool] and consequently the value of your
interest in the [commodity pool]. Also, market conditions may make
it difficult or impossible for the [commodity pool] to liquidate a
position.
The [commodity pool] is subject to certain conflicts of interest.
The [commodity pool] will be subject to the charges payable by it as
described in this prospectus that must be offset by revenues and
trading gains before an investor is entitled to a return on his or
her investment. It may be necessary for the [commodity pool] to make
substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of its
assets before an investor is entitled to a return on his or her
investment."
(2) For the initial prospectus, state in substantially the following
words:
"The [commodity pool] is newly organized. The success of the
[commodity pool] will depend upon a number of conditions that are
beyond the control of the [commodity pool]. There is substantial
risk that the goals of the [commodity pool] will not be met."
(3) If the promoter, manager, or a portfolio adviser of the
alternative mutual fund has not had a similar involvement with any
other publicly offered alternative mutual fund, state in
substantially the following words:
"The [promoter], [manager] [and/or] [portfolio adviser] of the
[alternative mutual fund] has not previously operated any other
publicly offered alternative mutual fund [or traded other
accounts]."
(4) If the commodity pool will execute trades outside Canada, state
in substantially the following words:
"Participation in transactions in [nature of instrument to be traded
by the commodity pool] involves the execution and clearing of trades
on or subject to the rules of a foreign market.
None of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities or Canadian
exchanges regulates activities of any foreign markets, including the
execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, or has the power
to compel enforcement of the rule of a foreign market or any
applicable foreign law. Generally, any foreign transaction will be
governed by applicable foreign laws. This is true even if the
foreign market is formally linked to a Canadian market so that a
position taken on a market may be liquidated by a transaction on
another market. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary
depending on the foreign country in which the transaction occurs.
For these reasons, entities such as the commodity pool that trade
[nature of instrument to be traded by the commodity pool] may not be
afforded certain of the protective measures provided by Canadian
legislation and the rules of Canadian exchanges. In particular,
funds received from customers for transactions may not be provided
the same protection as funds received in respect of transactions on
Canadian exchanges."
(5) State that the commodity pool is a mutual fund but that certain
provisions of securities legislation designed to protect investors
who purchase securities of mutual funds do not apply.
(6) Immediately after the statements required by subsections (1) to
(5), state in substantially the following words:
"These brief statements do not disclose all the risks and other
significant aspects of investing in the [commodity pool]. You should
therefore carefully study this prospectus, including a description
of the principal risk factors at page [page number], before you
decide to invest in the [commodity pool]."

1.14  Non-Canadian Manager
If the investment fund manager is incorporated, continued or
otherwise organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction or
resides outside of Canada, state the following with the bracketed
information completed:
"The manager is incorporated, continued or otherwise governed
under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction or resides outside
Canada. Although the manager has appointed [name and address of
agent for service] as its agent for service of process in Canada,
it may not be possible for investors to realize on judgements
obtained in Canada against the manager."

(5) For a group scholarship plan or other type of scholarship plan
that normally calculates the sales charge payable as a fixed
dollar amount linked to the amount of contribution by a subscriber
(i.e. $x.xx per unit), in addition to stating the fixed amount of
sales charge per unit as required under Instruction (3), the
disclosure of the amount of the sales charge in the table titled
"Fees you pay" in the column titled "What you pay" must also be
expressed as a percentage of the cost of a unit of the scholarship
plan. If the total cost of a unit of the scholarship plan varies
depending on the contribution option or frequency selected, the
percentage sales charge must be expressed as a range, between the
lowest and the highest percentage of the unit cost the sales
charge can represent, based on the different contribution options
available to subscribers under the scholarship plan. This must be
calculated as follows: (i) divide the sales charge per unit by the
contribution option that has the highest total cost per unit, and
(ii) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option
that has the lowest total cost per unit. For example, if a
scholarship plan calculates its sales charge as $200/unit, and the
total cost per unit for a subscriber can range from $1 000 to $5
000 (based on the different options available to subscribers), the
percentage range of the sales charge disclosed in the table would
be 4% (200/5000) to 20% (200/1000). The disclosure in the table
must also state that the exact percentage of the sales charge per
unit for a subscriber will depend on the contribution option
selected for contributing to the scholarship plan and how old
their beneficiary is at the time they open the scholarship plan.
