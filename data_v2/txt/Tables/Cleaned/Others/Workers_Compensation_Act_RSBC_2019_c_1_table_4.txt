(a)

the treatment, nursing or examination of patients or ill
persons,



(b)

the analysis or testing of body tissues or fluids, or



(c)

research into tuberculosis by a worker who,




(i)

when first engaged, or after an absence from employment of
the types mentioned in these regulations for a period of
more than one year, when re-engaged in such employment was
free from evidence of tuberculosis, and




(ii)

continued to be free from evidence of tuberculosis for 6
months after being so employed, except in the case of
primary tuberculosis as proven by a negative tuberculin
test at the time of employment. In the case of a worker
previously compensated for tuberculosis, any subsequent
tuberculosis after the disease has become inactive and has
remained inactive for a period of 3 years or more is not
to be considered to have occurred as a result of the
original disability, unless the worker is still engaged in
employment listed above or the Board is satisfied that the
subsequent tuberculosis is the direct result of the
tuberculosis for which the worker has been compensated.
