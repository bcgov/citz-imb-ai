Labour Relations Code



1

After receiving a ballot from the returning officer, the voter
must, in the polling booth or space provided, mark it with an "X"
in the square provided opposite to the division for which the
voter desires to vote, fold the ballot and, in the presence of the
returning officer or deputy returning officer and scrutineers, if
any, deposit the ballot in the box and then leave the premises.



2

Ballots that are not marked or have on them writing or a mark
other than "X" must be declared spoiled, except where the voter
has by some other mark, in the opinion of the returning officer or
deputy returning officer, clearly indicated an intention, in which
case the returning officer or deputy returning officer, whose
decision shall be final, may declare the ballot not spoiled and
count it accordingly.



3

No person other than the voter, for the time that it takes to
vote, is permitted in the polling booth or the allocated space.
