b
grams per tonne of asphalt recycled.
c
sample for at least one continuous hour for each machine train
unit.
d
applies to direct fired infrared plants only and calculated as

where IC
=
organics entering the afterburner in grams per tonne, as a one
hour average;
OC
=
organics leaving the afterburner in grams per tonne, as a one hour
average.
e
for stack emissions and emissions which originate around the
shrouding.
