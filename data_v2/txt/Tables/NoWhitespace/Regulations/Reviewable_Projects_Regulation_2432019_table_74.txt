Power Plants.
Criteria:
(1)
A new project with a rated nameplate capacity of
≥ 50 MW of electricity that is
(a)
a hydroelectric power plant,
(b)
a thermal electric power plant, or
(c)
another power plant, not including a power plant
referred to in subsections (2) to (5).
(2)
A new project that is a land-based wind generating
facility with 15 or more turbines.
(3)
A new project that is a wind generating facility with at
least one turbine located in water and a total of 10 or
more turbines.
(4)
A new project with a rated nameplate capacity of
≥ 15 MW of electricity that is an in-stream
tidal power facility.
(5)
A new project, other than a project referred to in
subsection (4), that is a tidal power generating
facility.
Criteria:
(1)
Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the existing
project, or the project after modification, were it a
new project in the same category, would increase by at
least the amounts set out in Column 2.
(2)
The following types of modifications are not reviewable
under subsection (1):
(a)
replacement of generators or turbines;
(b)
other maintenance repairs.
(3)
Subsection (1) does not apply to projects described in
subsection (5) of Column 2.
(4)
Modification of an existing project described in
subsection (5) of Column 2, if the modification would
increase production capacity by 50% or more.
Criteria:
(1)
Dismantling or abandonment of an existing dam project
associated with an existing hydroelectric power plant of
any size, if the dam is, or was, permitted under the
Water Sustainability Act
to impound ≥ 10 million m
3
of water.
2
Transmission Lines.
Criteria:
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), a new transmission line of
345 kV or higher voltage and of 40 km or more
in length, if the land on which the line is built is not
alongside and contiguous to an area of land previously
developed for a transmission line, transmission
pipeline, public highway or railway.
(2)
Assessment of a new project under subsection (1) does
not include the dismantling and abandonment phases.
Criteria:
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), modification of an existing
project if
(a)
the existing project, or the project after modification,
were it a new project, would meet the criteria set out
opposite in Column 2, and
(b)
the land in which the modified line is built is 40 km or
more in length and is not alongside and contiguous to an
area of land previously developed for a transmission
line, transmission pipeline, public highway or railway.
(2)
Assessment of the modification of an existing project
under subsection (1) does not include the dismantling
and abandonment phases.
