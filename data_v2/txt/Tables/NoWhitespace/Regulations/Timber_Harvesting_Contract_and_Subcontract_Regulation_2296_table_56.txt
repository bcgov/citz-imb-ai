Timber Harvesting Contract
and Subcontract Regulation
Forest Act
1
The contractor's obligation to offer a replacement subcontract to
the subcontractor is subject to it being reasonably apparent at
the time when the offer otherwise must be made that there will be
a sufficient amount of work available for the replacement
subcontract, based upon the contractor's then current or a future
replacement contract with the licence holder.
