(1) This information is provided as at [insert date of end
of financial year] of the year shown.
(2) Management expense ratio is based on total expenses
(excluding [distributions], commissions and other portfolio
transaction costs) for the stated period and is expressed as an
annualized percentage of daily average net asset value during
the period.
(3) The trading expense ratio represents total commissions
and other portfolio transaction costs expressed as an annualized
percentage of daily average net asset value during the period.
(4) The Fund's portfolio turnover rate indicates how actively
the Fund's portfolio adviser manages its portfolio investments.
A portfolio turnover rate of 100% is equivalent to the Fund
buying and selling all of the securities in its portfolio once
in the course of the year. The higher a fund's portfolio
turnover rate in a year, the greater the trading costs payable
by the fund in the year, and the greater the chance of an
investor receiving taxable capital gains in the year. There is
not necessarily a relationship between a high turnover rate and
the performance of a fund.
