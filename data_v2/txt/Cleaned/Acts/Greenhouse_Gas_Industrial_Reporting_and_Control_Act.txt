Excess greenhouse gas emissions





5


(
1
)



For the purposes of this Act, a regulated operation has excess
greenhouse gas emissions in a compliance period if the amount of
greenhouse gas emissions, determined in accordance with the
regulations on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis, attributable to
the regulated operation for the compliance period exceeds the
emission limit applicable to the regulated operation for the
compliance period.






(
2
)



The amount of excess greenhouse gas emissions of a regulated
operation for a compliance period is the following:






(
a
)



subject to paragraph (b), the amount reported in the compliance
report under section 7 (1) submitted to the director for the
compliance period;






(
b
)



if one or more supplementary reports under section 7 (3), or
corrected reports under section 7 (5.1), are submitted to the
director in relation to the amount of excess greenhouse gas
emissions for the compliance period, the amount reported in the most
recent report.






(
3
)



Despite subsection (2), if the director determines the amount of
excess greenhouse gas emissions for the compliance period under
section 7.1 (1), the amount of excess greenhouse gas emissions is
one of the following amounts, as determined by the director:






(
a
)



the amount determined by the director under section 7.1 (1);






(
b
)



if the director accepts a supplementary report or corrected report
referred to in subsection (2) (b), the amount reported in the
report.







Compliance obligation




6

(1)


Subject to subsection (2), for each compliance period, the operator of
a regulated operation must ensure that the amount of greenhouse gas
emissions, determined in accordance with the regulations on a carbon
dioxide equivalent basis, that is attributable to the regulated
operation is less than or equal to the emission limit applicable to
the regulated operation for the compliance period.





(
2
)



Subject to the regulations, the operator of a regulated operation in
a prescribed class of regulated operations that has excess
greenhouse gas emissions in a compliance period may meet its
compliance obligation by doing one or both of the following by the
compliance obligation deadline:






(
a
)



ensuring that compliance units are available in a compliance account
of the regulated operation for retirement;






(
b
)



making a monetary payment to the government.






(
3
)



Subject to the regulations, the amount required to meet the
compliance obligation under subsection (2) of a regulated operation
for a compliance period is calculated at the following rates:






(
a
)



one compliance unit for each tonne of excess greenhouse gas
emissions in the compliance period;






(
b
)



the dollar amount set out in column 1 of the Schedule for each tonne
of excess greenhouse gas emissions in the compliance period set out
opposite in column 2 of the Schedule.







Greenhouse gas emission correction





6.1

1
)



This section applies if, as a result of a supplementary report under
section 7 (3), a corrected report under section 7 (5.1) or a

following is corrected after the operator of a regulated operation
has, under section 6 (2), met a compliance obligation, or the
director has, under section 12 (1)


[earned credits]


, issued earned credits to the operator of a regulated operation in
relation to a compliance period:






(
a
)



the emission limit for the regulated operation for the compliance
period;






(
b
)



the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, determined in accordance
with the regulations on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis,
attributable to the regulated operation for the compliance period.






(
2
)



In the circumstances described in subsection (1), the operator of
the regulated operation or the director, as applicable, must do the
following, in accordance with the regulations:






(
a
)



if the correction results in an increased amount required under
section 6 (3), the operator must, within the prescribed period, meet
the additional compliance obligation;






(
b
)



if the correction results in a reduced amount required under section
6 (3), the director may do one or a combination of the following:






(
i
)



issue, by crediting to a holding account of the operator of the
regulated operation, compliance units equivalent to the amount of
any overpayment made by the regulated operation;






(
ii
)



issue a monetary refund equivalent to the amount of any overpayment
made by the regulated operation;






(
c
)



if the correction results in additional credits to be issued to the
regulated operation under section 12, the director may issue, by
crediting to a holding account of the operator, earned credits
calculated in accordance with section 12 (1);






(
d
)



if the correction results in fewer credits to be issued to the
regulated operation under section 12, the operator must, within the
prescribed period,






(
i
)



ensure that the number of compliance units equal to the number of
excess credits issued are available in a compliance account for the
regulated operation for retirement or cancellation, or






(
ii
)
