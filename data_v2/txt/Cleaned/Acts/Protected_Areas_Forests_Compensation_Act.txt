the same meanings as in the

Forest Act

.






Protected areas deleted from licensed areas




2

(1)


Crown land in a protected area itemized in Column 1 of the Schedule is
conclusively deemed, effective on the date in Column 2 of the same
item, to have been deleted from any part of any tree farm licence
area, timber licence area, woodlot licence area or timber supply area
that, on that date, is within the boundaries of that protected area.




(2)

Each of the following is deemed amended to reflect the deletion under
subsection (1):




(a)

a tree farm licence, timber licence or woodlot licence that authorizes
the harvesting of timber in a tree farm licence area, timber licence
area or woodlot licence area referred to in subsection (1);




(b)

the boundaries of a timber supply area referred to in subsection (1).




(3)

For the purposes of the application of section 60 of the

Forest Act

and the determination of compensation under that section, the
deletions under subsection (1) must be considered to have been for a
purpose other than




(a)

access to Crown timber,




(b)

highway, pipeline or power transmission line rights of way,




(c)

water storage, or




(d)

timber production.






Deletion under section 60 of the
Forest Act




3

(1)


A deletion under section 2 (1) from a tree farm licence area, timber
licence area or woodlot licence area is conclusively deemed, for all
purposes, to have been and to be a deletion of Crown land validly made
under section 60 of the

Forest Act

as that section read at the time of the deletion, even though notice
was not served in accordance with that section.




(2)

If doubt exists as to whether and to what extent, if any, an allowable
cut reduction for a tree farm licence was or is attributable to the
deletion of land referred to in subsection (1), the chief forester may
issue a written statement resolving the doubt.




(3)

A written statement under subsection (2) is conclusive for the
purposes of subsection (1).






Allowable annual cut reductions under section 60 of the
Forest Act




4

(1)


An annual cut reduction, to the extent that it was or is attributable
to the establishment of a protected area, is conclusively deemed, for
all purposes, to have been and to be a reduction in allowable annual
cut validly made under section 60 of the

Forest Act

as that section read at the time of the reduction, even though notice
was not served in accordance with that section.




(2)

If doubt exists as to whether and to what extent, if any, an annual
cut reduction for any forest licence or timber sale licence was or is
attributable to the establishment of a protected area in a timber
supply area, the minister or a person designated by the minister,
after consulting with the chief forester, may issue a written
statement resolving the doubt.




(3)

A written statement under subsection (2) is conclusive for the
purposes of subsection (1).

to the holder of a tree farm licence, timber licence, woodlot licence,

No application to settled claims of licence holders




6


This Act does not apply in respect of a claim by the holder of a
licence against the government for compensation or damages because of
a deletion under section 2 (1) or an annual cut reduction if, before
