[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 76






Provincial voters as practitioners




1


Despite any other law, a person whose name is on the Provincial list
of voters for the electoral district in which the court is held is
entitled to appear in the Supreme Court or in the Provincial Court or
before a justice as the attorney and advocate of any party to any
proceedings in that court, even though the person is not a practising
lawyer.

The Supreme Court, the Provincial Court or a justice

has the right to refuse audience to a person practising in that court
or before that justice under the authority of this Act if, in the
opinion of the court or justice, the person is guilty of any gross
misconduct, and




(b)

court or before the justice as the court or justice would have over a
qualified practitioner practising in there.
