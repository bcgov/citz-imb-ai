refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise, of a statutory
power.






Error of law




3


The court's power to set aside a decision because of error of law on
the face of the record on an application for relief in the nature of
certiorari is extended so that it applies to an application for
judicial review in relation to a decision made in the exercise of a
statutory power of decision to the extent it is not limited or
precluded by the enactment conferring the power of decision.






Existing provision limiting judicial review not affected




4


Subject to section 3, nothing in this Act permits a person to bring a
proceeding referred to in section 2 if the person is otherwise
limited or prohibited by law from bringing the proceeding.






Powers to direct tribunal to reconsider

On an application for judicial review in relation to the exercise,
refusal to exercise, or purported exercise of a statutory power of
decision, the court may direct the tribunal whose act or omission is
the subject matter of the application to reconsider and determine,
either generally or in respect of a specified matter, the whole or any
part of a matter to which the application relates.




(2)

In giving a direction under subsection (1), the court must




(a)

advise the tribunal of its reasons, and




(b)

give it any directions that the court thinks appropriate for the
reconsideration or otherwise of the whole or any part of the matter
that is referred back for reconsideration.






Effect of direction




6


In reconsidering a matter referred back to it under section 5,
the tribunal must have regard to the court's reasons for giving the
direction and to the court's directions.






Power to set aside decision




7


If an applicant is entitled to a declaration that a decision made in
the exercise of a statutory power of decision is unauthorized or
otherwise invalid, the court may set aside the decision instead of
making a declaration.






Power to refuse relief




8

(1)


If, in a proceeding referred to in section 2, the court had,
before February 1, 1977, a discretion to refuse to grant
relief on any ground, the court has the same discretion to refuse to
grant relief on the same ground.




(2)

Despite subsection (1), the court may not refuse to grant relief
in a proceeding referred to in section 2 on the ground that the
relief should have been sought in another proceeding referred to in
section 2.






Defects in form, technical irregularities




9

(1)


On an application for judicial review of a statutory power of
decision, the court may refuse relief if




(a)

the sole ground for relief established is a defect in form or a
technical irregularity, and




(b)

the court finds that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred.




(2)

If the decision has already been made, the court may make an order
validating the decision despite the defect, to have effect from a time
and on terms the court considers appropriate.






Interim order




10


On an application for judicial review, the court may make an interim
order it considers appropriate until the final determination of the
application.






No time limit for applications




11


An application for judicial review is not barred by passage of time
unless




(a)

an enactment otherwise provides, and




(b)

the court considers that substantial prejudice or hardship will result
to any other person affected by reason of delay.






No writ to issue




12

(1)


No writ of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari may be issued.




(2)

An application for relief in the nature of mandamus, prohibition or
certiorari, must be treated as an application for judicial review
under section 2.






Summary disposition of proceedings




13

(1)


On the application of a party to a proceeding for a declaration or
injunction, the court may direct that any issue about the exercise,
refusal to exercise or proposed or purported exercise of a statutory
power be disposed of summarily, as if it were an application for
judicial review.




(2)

Subsection (1) applies whether or not the proceeding for a declaration
or injunction includes a claim for other relief.






Sufficiency of application




14


An application for judicial review is sufficient if it sets out the
ground on which relief is sought and the nature of the relief sought,
without specifying by which proceeding referred to in section 2
the claim would have been made before February 1, 1977.






Notice to decision maker and right to be a party




15

(1)


For an application for judicial review in relation to the exercise,
refusal to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise of a statutory
power, the person who is authorized to exercise the power




(a)

must be served with notice of the application and a copy of the
petition, and




(b)

may be a party to the application, at the person's option.




(2)

If 2 or more persons, whether styled a board or commission or any
other collective title, act together to exercise a statutory power,
they are deemed for the purpose of subsection (1) to be one
person under the collective title, and service, if required, is
effectively made on any one of those persons.

16

(1)


The Attorney General must be served with notice of an application for
judicial review and notice of an appeal from a decision of the court
with respect to the application.




(2)

exercise or purported exercise of a statutory power of decision, the
court may direct that the record of the proceeding, or any part of it,
be filed in the court.






Informations in the nature of quo warranto




18

(1)


Informations in the nature of quo warranto are abolished.




(2)

If a person acts in an office in which the person is not entitled to
act and an information in the nature of quo warranto would, but for

under an application for judicial review, grant an injunction
restraining the person from acting and may declare the office to be
vacant.




(3)

A proceeding for an injunction under this section may not be taken by
a person who would not immediately before February 1, 1977,
