Division 3 — Unsolicited Goods or Services





Definition and interpretation




11

(1)


In this Division,

"unsolicited goods or services"

means goods or services that are supplied to a consumer who did not
request them, other than




(a)

goods or services supplied to a consumer who knew or ought to have
known they were intended for delivery to another person,




(b)

goods or services for which the supplier does not require payment, or




(c)

a prescribed supply of goods or services.




(2)

For the purposes of the definition of "unsolicited goods or services",
a request for goods or services must not be inferred only from the
passage of time or from the consumer's




(a)

payment for the goods or services,




(b)

use of the goods or services,




(c)

request to purchase another similar good or service, or




(d)

inaction.






Unsolicited goods or services




12

(1)


A consumer has no legal obligation in respect of unsolicited goods or
services unless and until the consumer expressly acknowledges to the
supplier in writing the consumer's intention to accept the goods or
services.




(2)

Unless the consumer has given the acknowledgement referred to in
subsection (1), the supplier does not have a cause of action for any
loss, use, misuse, possession, damage or misappropriation in respect
of the goods or services or the value obtained by the use of the goods
or services.




(3)

Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to goods supplied to a consumer
on a continuing basis under a contract between the consumer and
supplier.




(4)

If it is alleged that the supplier supplied unsolicited goods or
services, the burden of proof that the goods or services were not
unsolicited is on the supplier.






Material change resulting in unsolicited goods or services




13

(1)


This section does not apply to




(a)

a material change in services referred to in section 25 (4)
[continuing services contract — cancellation]
, and




(b)

a change to the price of goods or services or a renewal of an existing
supply of goods or services if the goods or services are not otherwise
changed.




(2)

If a consumer is being supplied with goods or services on a continuing
basis and there is a material change in the goods or services, or in
the supply of the goods or services, the goods or services are deemed
to be unsolicited goods or services from the time of the material
change unless the supplier is able to establish that the consumer
consented to the material change.




(3)

Subject to subsection (4), a supplier may rely on a consumer's consent
to the material change if that consent is made by any method that
permits the supplier to produce evidence to establish the consumer's
consent.




(4)

A supplier does not establish a consumer's consent by providing notice
to the consumer to the effect that the supplier will supply the
materially changed goods or services to the consumer unless the
consumer instructs the supplier not to supply the goods or services.






Consumer's remedy if unsolicited goods or services




14

(1)


A consumer who pays for unsolicited goods or services may give to the
supplier a demand, in writing, for a refund from the supplier within 2
years after the consumer first received the goods or services if the
consumer did not expressly acknowledge to the supplier in writing the
consumer's intention to accept the goods or services.




(2)

A demand is sufficient if it indicates, in any way, the intention of
the consumer to demand a refund of a payment made for unsolicited
goods or services.




(3)

If a supplier receives a demand for a refund, the supplier must refund
to the consumer, within 15 days after the supplier received the
demand, all money received in respect of the unsolicited goods or
services.




Part 3 — Rights of Assignees and Guarantors Respecting Consumer Credit





Assignee's obligations




15

(1)


Subject to subsection (2), an assignee of a right of a supplier in a
consumer transaction has no greater right than, and is subject to the
same obligations as, the assignor respecting the credit given to the
consumer.




(2)

A consumer must not receive from, and is not entitled to set off
against, an assignee of the supplier an amount greater than the
balance owing on the contract at the time of the assignment.






Guarantor has same rights as consumer




16


A guarantor may rely on a defence that is available to a consumer in
an action commenced by a supplier against the guarantor, whether or
not the consumer is a party to the action, but a guarantor must not
use the infancy or bankruptcy of the consumer as a defence.
