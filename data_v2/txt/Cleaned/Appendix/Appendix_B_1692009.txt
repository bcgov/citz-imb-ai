Appendix B — Costs





Scale of costs




1

(1)


If a court has made an order for costs, it may determine if the family
law case involves less than ordinary difficulty, ordinary difficulty
or more than ordinary difficulty.




(2)

If the difficulty involved in a family law case has not been
determined under subsection (1), costs must be assessed under
subsection (4) as if the family law case involved ordinary difficulty.




(3)

Unless the court otherwise orders or the parties otherwise agree, if
an offer to settle is made under Rule 11-1, any costs payable on
acceptance of that offer must be assessed as if the family law case
involved ordinary difficulty.




(4)

After the difficulty involved in a family law case has been
determined, a registrar must assess the costs in accordance with the
Schedule.






Apportionment if proceedings tried together

If 2 or more family law cases have, by order, been tried at the same
time or tried one after the other and no order has been made as to
apportionment of costs, the registrar may
