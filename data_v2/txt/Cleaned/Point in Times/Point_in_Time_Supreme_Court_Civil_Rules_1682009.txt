A probate action must be started by notice of civil claim, and
Part 1 of the notice of civil claim must contain a statement of
the interest of the plaintiff and of each defendant in the estate
of the deceased.







Parties



(4)

Each person who is entitled or claims to be entitled to administer
the estate of a deceased person under or by virtue of an unrevoked
grant of probate or letters of administration must be made a party
to any action for revocation of the grant, and by leave of the
court a person interested in the estate, but not named as a
defendant, may defend the action as if the person were a
defendant.







Action for revocation of grant



(5)

as to execution were, in fact, complied with.

in, or otherwise identified by, the attestation clause, an
affidavit must be filed to provide proof that the interlineation
