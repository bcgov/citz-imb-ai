means imported electricity that is a downstream power benefit to
which Canada is entitled as described in Articles V (1) and VII of
the Columbia River Treaty and determined in accordance with that
treaty;



"Columbia River Treaty"

means the treaty between Canada and the United States of America
relating to the Cooperative Development of the Water Resources of
the Columbia River Basin, including its Annexes A and B, signed at
Washington, District of Columbia, United States of America on the
17th day of January, 1961, and the Protocol brought into force by
the exchange of instruments of ratification and an exchange of
notes on September 16, 1964;



"default emissions factor"

means




(a)

for an unspecified source that is located in a jurisdiction listed
in Western Climate Initiative's most recently published Default
Emissions Factor Calculator, DEF Calculator Page, the figure in
the Grand Total column of that page in the sum of emission factor
rows for that jurisdiction, or




(b)

if paragraph (a) does not apply, an emissions factor approved by
the director;



"electricity transaction"

means the purchase, sale, import, export or exchange of electric
power;



"electricity wheeled through British Columbia"

means electricity that is imported into British Columbia but
simultaneously the same amount of electricity is exported out of
British Columbia;



"plant information summary"

means the plant information table included in the Final Default
Emissions Factor Calculator most recently published by the Western
Climate Initiative;



"specified power"

means imported electricity that the electricity import operation
can identify as being generated at an electricity generating
facility or sub-facility because




(a)

the operation is controlled by the owner of the facility or
sub-facility, or




(b)

the facility or sub-facility is identified in the power contract
under which the electricity was imported,


but does not include Canadian entitlement power;



"specified source"

, in relation to a transaction respecting specified power, means




(a)

the sub-facility identified as the source of the specified power,
if




(i)

the transaction identifies a sub-facility, or unit within a
sub-facility, as the source of the specified power, and




(ii)

the plant information summary identifies emissions and net
generation for that sub-facility, and




(b)

if paragraph (a) does not apply, the facility identified in the
transaction as the source of the specified power;



"sub-facility"

means any electrical generating unit or group of electrical
generating units within a facility;



"unspecified power"

means imported electricity, other than Canadian entitlement power,
that is not specified power;



"unspecified source"

means the pool, balancing authority or other source of unspecified
power that is identified in the NERC E-tag as a source other than
a specified source.






Calculation of emissions from specified sources




2


The emissions reported under section 4 (a) (vi) of this Schedule
must be calculated in accordance with the following equation:





CO
2
= MWhimp × Applicable Factor








where



CO
2

=

the amount reported under section 4 (a) (v) of this Schedule
measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;



MWhimp
=

megawatt-hours of electricity imported from the specified
source as measured at the first point of delivery in British
Columbia;




Applicable Factor

=

in relation to

(a) a specified source listed in the plant information
summary, the amount derived by dividing emissions in the
tonnes column of the plant information summary by net
generation for the unit or facility as specified in the net
generation column of the plant information summary, and

(b) a specified source not listed in the plant information
summary, one of the following:

(i) if the specified source is a wind, solar, hydro or
nuclear facility, zero;

(ii) if subparagraph (i) does not apply, 0.435 Mt CO
2
e per MWh or such other amount approved by the director.









Calculation of emissions from unspecified sources




3


The emissions reported under section 4 (b) (iii) of this Schedule
must be calculated by multiplying the reported quantities of
imported electricity from each balancing authority area, by the
appropriate default emission factor calculated in accordance with
the following equation:





CO
2
= MWh × DEF








where



CO
2

=

annual CO
2
mass emissions for imported electricity from the unspecified
source, in tonnes;



MWh
=

megawatt-hours of electricity imported from the balancing
authority area;



DEF
=

the default emission factor corresponding to the balancing
authority area in which the unspecified source is located









Reporting requirements




4

emission report of an electricity import operation must include
the following:




(a)

for each specified source of electricity imported by the
electricity import operation during the reporting period,




(i)

if the specified source is a facility, the name of that facility,




(ii)

if the specified source is a sub-facility, the name of the
facility that includes the specified source,




(iii)

the identification provided in the plant information summary for
the facility referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii), if any,




(iv)

if the specified source is a sub-facility, the sub-facility ID
identified for that sub-facility in the plant information summary,




(v)

for imported electricity generated by the specified source and
imported by the reporting operation during the reporting period,
amounts of such electricity as measured at the first point of
delivery in British Columbia, and




(vi)

the amount of emissions attributable to the electricity importing
operation associated with the production of electricity referred
to in subparagraph (v);




(b)

for each unspecified source of electricity imported by the
electricity import operation during the reporting period,




(i)

the name of the unspecified source,




(ii)

the amount of electricity imported as measured at the first point
of delivery, measured in megawatt-hours, and




(iii)

the amount of emissions attributable to the electricity importing
operation associated with the production of electricity referred
to in subparagraph (ii);




(c)

electricity wheeled through British Columbia in the reporting
period, that is owned by the electricity import operation at the
first point of delivery in British Columbia, in megawatt-hours.

2022.



Schedule E



Emissions Attributable for Compliance Purposes to Electricity
Usage






Definition




1


In this Schedule,

"emission intensity factor"

means the number published by the director, for the compliance
period, that represents the carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes per
MWh averaged for the 3 calendar years preceding the compliance
period, calculated in accordance with the following formula for
each of the 3 calendar years:





GHG
generation
+ GHG
imported

MWh
generation
+ MWh
imported








where



GHG
generation

=
