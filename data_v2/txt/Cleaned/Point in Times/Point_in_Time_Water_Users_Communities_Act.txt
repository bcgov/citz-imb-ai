manager's proposal to suspend rights under a licence must be given
to the person exercising the rights or to the person occupying the

rights may be suspended without a hearing.




(4)

In the case of a licence appurtenant to land, notice of the
proposal to cancel the licence must be sent to every registered
owner of the land and to every person who has notified the
comptroller or a regional water manager that he or she has an
interest in it, but if the land comprises more than 6 parcels,
notice of the proposal to cancel the licence may be given by

water in accordance with the licence, the onus lies on the
licensee to prove that the licensee has complied with this Act,
the regulations and the licence.

If a licence has been cancelled in part, the comptroller or a
regional water manager may issue to the licensee

control of any land, mine or undertaking to which a licence is
appurtenant may, by notice in writing to the comptroller or a
regional water manager, abandon all or part of the rights held
under the licence.




(2)

If the land, mine or undertaking to which the licence is
appurtenant is mortgaged, and a copy of the mortgage, or
particulars of it, is filed with the comptroller or a regional
water manager, the abandonment is not effective without the
written consent of the mortgagee.

or the new final licence, obtain or retain a right, power or
privilege that has been the subject of the abandonment.






Liability of owner for damage remains




25


The abandonment, suspension, termination or cancellation of all or
part of the rights held under a licence or approval does not
relieve the owner of the land, mine or undertaking to which the
licence or approval is or was appurtenant of liability for damage
resulting from the works constructed, operated or maintained by
the owner, or from a defect, insufficiency or failure of the
works.






Permits over Crown land

purpose or waterworks purpose has the right to expropriate any
land the control of which by the licensee would help to prevent
pollution of the water authorized to be diverted.




(4)
