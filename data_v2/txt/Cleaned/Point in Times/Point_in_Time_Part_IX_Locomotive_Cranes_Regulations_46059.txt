1

These regulations shall apply to all locomotive cranes operating
under the jurisdiction of the government of British Columbia.





Portions of Boiler Code applicable



2

That portion of the regulations known as Parts I, III and IV of
the British Columbia Railway Department Boiler Code, adopted by
Order in Council No. 126 under the
Railways Act
on January 21, 1947, shall govern the design, registration and

General Inspection Regulations




Inspection frequency



3

Every locomotive crane shall be inspected before being put into
service and at least every 12 months thereafter by an inspector of
the ministry. Inspectors shall have the right, at all reasonable
hours, to examine locomotive cranes and may refuse to grant a
certificate for any locomotive crane found defective according to
the provisions of these regulations. They may order out of service
any locomotive crane which for any cause they consider unfit and
dangerous to operate.





Reporting of defects



4

It is the duty of every locomotive crane engineer to inform the
inspector of any defects known or believed to exist in the
locomotive crane under his charge. The certificate of competency
of any locomotive crane engineer refusing or refraining from doing
so may be revoked by the inspector.





If boilers too hot for safety



5

Inspectors may decline to examine boilers considered too hot for
safety and convenience, and shall refuse to grant certificates for
same until a satisfactory examination can be made.





Thickness of plate



6

In order to satisfy himself as to the thickness of a plate or the
internal condition of a boiler, the inspector may, should he deem
it necessary, order holes to be cut therein and may demand such
information by drawings and specifications of the several parts as
will enable him to determine their strength. In the event of such
information being unobtainable, he shall use a safety factor of
5.5, with such additions thereto as his judgment may dictate.





Removal of jacket and covering



7

At the first inspection of a locomotive crane the jacket and
covering shall be removed by the owner or his agent, so that a
thorough examination of the plates and rivets can be made. At
subsequent inspections such jacket and covering or any part of
same shall be removed upon the request of the inspector.





Lap joint longitudinal seams



8

Every boiler having lap joint longitudinal seams without
reinforcing plates shall be examined with special care in order to
detect any grooving or cracks at the edges of the seams.





Safety valves, etc.



9

Inspectors shall see that the safety valves, water gauges, test
cocks, blowoff pipes, main steam pipes and all fittings and
connections of boilers are in good order and sufficient in number,
and that they comply with the requirements of these regulations.





Calculation of strength



10

Inspectors shall calculate the strength of locomotive crane
boilers by formulae provided in the British Columbia Railway
Department Boiler Code, and shall determine the safe working
pressure thereof according to the calculated strength of the
various parts and the workmanship and material of which they are
composed, and shall record such working pressure upon the
certificate of inspection. In cases where the necessary formula
for any type of boiler is not provided, application shall be made
to the chief inspector, who shall furnish same.





Reporting excess of pressure



11

In cases where inspectors find that a locomotive crane boiler is
or has been carrying an excess of pressure beyond that which has
been recorded on the certificate of inspection, they shall report
same to the chief inspector for prosecution, and require the owner
to install thereon a lockup valve of approved pattern to prevent
the carrying of excessive pressure.




Certificates




Issuance of certificate



12

A certificate shall be issued by the inspector for every
locomotive crane found, after inspection and testing, to be in
satisfactory working condition. Such certificate, showing date of
last inspection and working pressure allowed, shall be placed
under glass in the cab of every such locomotive crane.





Period of certificate



13

Certificates shall be issued covering a period of 12 months, but
should the inspector consider it advisable, he may issue a
certificate for a lesser period.





Suspension of certificate



14

Inspectors finding defects in any locomotive crane having an
unexpired certificate may suspend such certificate until repairs
are made or necessary fittings supplied.

Interior Inspection of Boilers




Interior examination before boiler in service



19

Inspectors shall examine the interior of every boiler thoroughly
before it is put into service and whenever a sufficient number of
flues are removed to allow of examination.





What examination must cover



20

Inspectors shall examine the entire interior of the boiler for
cracks, pitting, grooving or indication of overheating, and for
damage where mud has collected or heavy scale formed. The edges of
plates, all laps, seams and points where cracks and defects are
likely to develop, or where an exterior examination may have
indicated possible defects, must be given an especially minute
examination. It must be seen that braces and stays are taut, that
pins are properly secured in place and that each is in a condition
to support its proportion of the load.




Exterior Inspection of Boilers




Exterior examination



21

Inspectors shall examine the exterior of every boiler thoroughly
before it is put into service and whenever the jacket and lagging
are removed.





How often examination must occur



22

The jacket and lagging shall be removed after 60 calendar months
service, provided such service is performed within 6 consecutive
years. The inspector shall examine the entire exterior of the
boiler while it is under hydrostatic pressure. If the inspector
considers it necessary, he may order the removal of the jacket and
lagging at any time when leaks are indicated.




Hydrostatic Testing of Boilers




Frequency of hydrostatic testing



23

Inspectors may, whenever it is deemed necessary, and they shall,
before a locomotive crane is put into service, and at least once
every year thereafter, subject the boiler of same to a hydrostatic
test 25% in excess of the working pressure allowed, using water at
a temperature of 100° Fahrenheit; provided, however, that such
test may be omitted for reasons to be stated in the inspector's
report.





Owner must provide piping and fittings



24

For the purpose of such tests the owner or his agent shall provide
the necessary piping and fittings to connect the inspector's pump
to the boiler, and shall provide men to fill the boiler with
water, make all joints, work the test pump and assist the
inspector during the test.





Interior surface inspection



25

The handhole covers must be removed and the interior surface and
connections of the boiler examined as thoroughly as conditions
will permit.





Examination after repairs



26

When all necessary repairs have been completed, the boiler shall
be fired up and the steam pressure raised, and the boiler and
appurtenances carefully examined. All cocks, valves, seams, rivets
and bolts must be tight under the pressure and all defects
disclosed must be repaired.





Repair of defects and reinspection



27

In any case where defects are discovered or in which the test is
unsatisfactory to the inspector, the defects shall be made good
and the boiler reinspected before a certificate is issued.





Method of testing rigid bolts



28

The inspector must tap each bolt and determine the broken bolts
from the sound or the vibration of the sheet. If staybolt tests
are made when the boiler is filled with water, there must be not
less than 50 pounds pressure on the boiler. Should the boiler not
be under pressure, the test may be made after draining all the
water from the boiler, in which case the vibration of the sheet
will indicate any unsoundness.





Broken staybolts



29

No boiler shall be allowed to remain in service when there are 2
adjacent staybolts broken or plugged in any part of the firebox or
combustion chamber, nor when 3 or more are broken or plugged in a
