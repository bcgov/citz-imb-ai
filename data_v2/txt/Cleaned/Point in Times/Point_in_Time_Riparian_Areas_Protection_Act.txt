(2)

The Lieutenant Governor in Council may, by regulation, designate a

to the protection of a population of fish whose sustainability is
at risk because of inadequate flow of water within the stream or
degradation of fish habitat.




(3)

subsection (2) if the Lieutenant Governor in Council considers
that




(a)

the sustainability of the protected fish population is no longer
at risk,




(b)

the implementation of a recovery plan under section 7 will reduce
that risk such that the designation of the stream is no longer
required, or




(c)

removal of the designation is in the public interest.

A licence, an approval or an amendment to a licence or an
approval, in relation to a sensitive stream, may only be issued by

approval or amendment if satisfied that any adverse impact of the
proposal on the sustainability of the protected fish population is
likely to be insignificant.




(7)

The comptroller or regional water manager may issue the licence,
approval or amendment if satisfied that the application includes
mitigation measures such that the proposal is not likely to have a
significant adverse impact on fish or fish habitat.

proposal is likely to have a significant adverse impact on fish or
fish habitat that

cannot be addressed by mitigation measures referred to in
subsection (7), or




(b)

cannot be fully addressed by mitigation measures referred to in
subsection (7),


the comptroller or regional water manager may only issue the

measures, in place of or supplemental to the mitigation measures,
