Test sequence




29.30


Each test pursuant to section 29.29 shall consist of 3 parts which
shall be performed in sequence and without any interruption
between each part, by




(a)

installing previously weighted hydrocarbon vapour collection
devices on all fuel system external vents, then heating, by
artificial means, the fuel in the tank of the motor vehicle to a
temperature between 28° and 30° C, over a period of not less than
50 minutes and not more than 70 minutes, after which time the
motor vehicle shall be moved on to a dynamometer,




(b)

running the motor vehicle on an engine dynamometer from a cold
start through 9 identical testing cycles without stalling of the
motor vehicle engine and with each cycle lasting 137 seconds and
including a series of periods of acceleration, deceleration,
steady speeds and idling, and




(c)

permitting the motor vehicle to stand for a period of one hour at
an ambient temperature between 24° and 30° C, after which time the
hydrocarbon vapour collection devices shall be removed from the
motor vehicle and sealed.

[en. B.C. Reg. 229/70; am. B.C. Reg. 343/77.]





Evaporative emissions




29.31


The evaporative emissions of section 29.29 (c) shall be obtained
by reweighing the previously weighted hydrocarbon vapour
collection devices and the increase of weight of such devices
shall be recorded in respect of each motor vehicle so that a
value, expressed as grams of hydrocarbons per test, is obtained
for that motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine for the purposes
of section 29.35.

[en. B.C. Reg. 229/70.]





Number of tests required




29.32


In the selection of motor vehicles for the testing of evaporative
emissions, for the purposes of section 29.29 (d), where the number
of motor vehicles sold by a manufacturer in British Columbia in
the last preceding model year is less than 10% of the total sales
of motor vehicles in British Columbia in the same period, the
manufacturer shall have regard to the combination chosen so that
the number of motor vehicles tested for durability of the
evaporative emission control systems or devices shall be not fewer
than 4 and not more than 8 and shall represent at least 50% of the
number of light duty vehicles sold by the manufacturer during such
model year.

[en. B. C. Reg. 229/70.]





Length of test




29.33

(1)


Every motor vehicle selected for testing pursuant to sections
29.29 (d) and 29.32 shall be driven a distance of at least 80 000
km and tested in the manner set out in section 29.30, the tests to
be carried out on each motor vehicle at intervals of not more than
6 000 km, and the results from such tests shall be recorded.




(2)

From the results recorded under subsection (1), values shall be
calculated for the evaporative emissions during each test for each
6 000 km interval for each motor vehicle in the manner set out in
section 29.31 and the representative values so obtained shall be
used in calculation of the factor mentioned in section 29.35.

[en. B.C. Reg. 229/70; am. B.C. Reg. 343/77.]





Composite value required




29.34


Where, pursuant to the provisions of this Division, recording is
made of results of test for amounts of evaporative emissions in
respect of any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine, a composite
value shall be determined under the provisions of section 29.35
for each engine displacement, which composite value shall take
into account factors of deterioration in efficiency of the system
or device installed thereon or incorporated therein resulting from
the use of such motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine, in
accordance with the procedure set out in section 29.35.

[en. B.C. Reg. 229/70.]





Procedure for calculation of composite value




29.35


The procedure for the calculation of the composite value of the
evaporative emissions shall be as follows:




(a)

for each combination of exhaust emission control systems or
devices and evaporative emission control systems or devices, an
evaporative emission deterioration factor shall be determined by
using the results obtained pursuant to section 29.33 and




(i)

plotting a graph for each combination of exhaust emission control
systems or devices and evaporative emission control systems or
devices of motor vehicle mileage against the evaporative emission
values so obtained,




(ii)

drawing a straight line by the method of least squares as near as
possible to the points plotted on each graph, and




(iii)

calculating the deterioration factor in respect of evaporative
emissions for deterioration in efficiency for each combination of
exhaust emission control systems or devices and evaporative
emission control systems or devices in accordance with the formula






evaporated emissions interpolated to 80 000 km




factor


=


minus





evaporated emissions interpolated to 6 000 km







(b)

the evaporative emission test results from each motor vehicle
tested under sections 29.29 (a), 29.30 and 29.31 shall be added to
the appropriate factor determined in paragraph (a) for the
particular engine displacement of that motor vehicle;




(c)

for each engine displacement, the results obtained under paragraph
(b) for each motor vehicle in that engine displacement class shall
be weighted in proportion to the projected sales of the motor
vehicles represented by each test motor vehicle;




(d)

for each engine displacement, the weighted results obtained
paragraph (c) shall be averaged;




(e)

for each engine displacement, the evaporative emissions to be
compared with the standard of section 29.27 shall be the averaged
value for evaporative emissions obtained in paragraph (d).

the Specified Conditions of Carriage set out in paragraph (c);

or that carrier's agent and must contain or incorporate by

Specified Conditions of Carriage



Article 1:

The carrier of the goods described in this bill of lading is
liable for any loss or damage to the goods accepted by the
carrier or the carrier's agent except as provided in these
Articles.



Article 2:

In the case of a shipment handled by 2 or more carriers, the
carrier issuing the bill of lading (the "originating
carrier"), and the carrier who assumes responsibility for
delivery to the consignee (the "delivering carrier"), in
addition to any other liability under these Articles, are,
if the goods being transported are lost or damaged while
they are in the custody of any other carrier to whom these
goods are or have been delivered, jointly and severally
liable with that other carrier for that loss or damage.



Article 3:

The originating carrier or the delivering carrier, as the
case may be, is entitled to recover from any other carrier
to whom the goods are or have been delivered the amount of
the loss or damage that the originating carrier or
delivering carrier, as the case may be, may be required to
pay under these Articles resulting from loss or damage to
the goods while they were in the custody of such other
carrier.



Article 4:

Nothing in Article 2 or 3 deprives a consignor or a
consignee of any remedy or right of action that the
consignor or consignee may have against any carrier.



Article 5:

The carrier is not liable for




(a)

loss, damage or delay to any of the goods described in this
bill of lading because of an Act of God, the Queen's or
public enemies, riots, strikes or a defect or inherent vice
in the goods being transported, or




(b)

loss or damage resulting from the act or default of the
consignor, the owner of the goods or the consignee, the
authority of law, quarantine or differences in weights of
grain, seed or other commodities caused by natural
shrinkage.



Article 6:

The carrier is not bound to transport the goods referred to
in this bill of lading by any particular vehicle or in time
for any particular market or otherwise than with due
dispatch unless by agreement specifically endorsed on this
bill of lading and signed by the parties to it.



Article 7:

In case of physical necessity, the carrier has the right to
forward the said goods by any conveyance or route between
the point of shipment and the point of destination, but the
liability of the carrier remains the same as though the
entire carriage were by highway.



Article 8:

If goods are stopped and held in transit at the request of a
party entitled to make such request, the goods are held at
the risk of that party.



Article 9:

Subject to Article 10, the amount of any loss or damage for
which the carrier is liable, whether or not such loss or
damage results from negligence, is to be computed on the
basis of the value of the goods at the place and time of
shipment (including the freight and other charges if paid
and the duty if paid or payable and not refundable) unless a
lower value has been represented in writing by the consignor
or has been agreed on between the parties to this bill of
lading, or is determined by the classification or tariff on
which the rate is based, in any of which events such lower
value is the amount that governs the computation of the
maximum liability of the carrier.



Article 10:

The amount of any loss or damage computed under Article 9
must not exceed $2 per pound ($4.41 per kilogram), computed
on the total weight of the shipment, unless a higher value
is declared on the face of the bill of lading by the
consignor.



Article 11:

If it is agreed between the parties that goods are to be
carried at the risk of the consignor, that agreement covers
only those risks that are necessarily incidental to
transportation and does not relieve the carrier from
liability for any loss or damage or delay that may result
from any negligent act or omission of the carrier or the
carrier's agents or employees, and the burden of proving
freedom from that negligence or omission is on the carrier.



Article 12a:

The carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay to any
of the goods transported under this bill of lading unless
notice of the loss, damage or delay, setting out particulars
of the origin, destination and date of shipment of the goods
and the estimated amount claimed in respect of such loss,
damage or delay, is given in writing to the originating
carrier (or the delivering carrier) within 60 days after the
delivery of the goods, or, in the case of failure to make
delivery, within 9 months after the date of shipment of the
goods.



Article 12b:

The final statement of the claim must be filed within 9
months after the date of shipment, together with a copy of
the paid freight bill.



Article 13:

A carrier is not bound to carry any documents, specie or any
articles of extraordinary value unless by special agreement
to do so. If such goods are carried without a special
agreement and the nature of the goods is not disclosed in
this bill of lading, the carrier is not liable for any loss
or damage in excess of the maximum liability stipulated in
Article 10 of these Conditions of Carriage.



Article 14a:

If required by the carrier, the freight and all other lawful
charges accruing on the goods must be paid before delivery,
and if on inspection it is ascertained that the goods
shipped are not those described in this bill of lading, the
freight charges must be paid on the goods actually shipped,
with any additional charges lawfully payable on those goods.



Article 14b:

Should the consignor fail to indicate on this bill of lading
that a shipment is to be transported prepaid, or should the
consignor fail to indicate the basis on which the shipment
is to be transported, the carrier is entitled to transport
the shipment on a freight collect basis.



Article 15:

Every person, whether as principal or agent, shipping
explosives or dangerous goods without previous full
disclosure to the carrier or its agent of the nature of such
goods is liable for all loss or damage caused by those
explosives or dangerous goods and such goods may be
warehoused at the consignor's risk and expense.



Article 16:

If, through no fault of the carrier, goods cannot be
delivered, the carrier after having given notice to the
consignor and the consignee that delivery has not been made,
and after requesting disposal instructions, may, pending
receipt of such disposal instructions, store the goods in
the warehouse of the carrier subject to a reasonable charge
for storage, or, after notifying the consignor of the
carrier's intention, may cause the goods to be removed to
and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the expense
of the consignor without liability on the part of the
carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other
lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for storage.



Article 17:

If notice has been given by the carrier under Article 16 and
no disposal instructions have been received within 10 days
after the date of that notice, the carrier may return to the
consignor at the consignor's expense all undelivered
shipments with respect to which the notice has been given.



Article 18:

Subject to Article 19, any alteration, addition or erasure
in the bill of lading must be signed or initialed by the
consignor or the consignor's agent and the originating
carrier or that carrier's agent, and unless so acknowledged
is without effect, and this bill of lading is enforceable
according to its original tenor.



Article 19:

It is the responsibility of the consignor to show correct
shipping weights of the shipment on the bill of lading if
completed by the consignor. Despite Article 18, failure to
do this makes the bill of lading subject to correction in
this respect by the carrier.







(2)

Subject to this Part, if household goods are accepted for shipment
by or on behalf of a carrier who operates a business vehicle
within the meaning of section 237 (a) or (c) of the Act, the

who assumes responsibility for delivery to the consignee
(the "delivering carrier"), in addition to any other
liability under this bill of lading, are, if the goods are
lost or damaged while they are in the custody of any other
carrier to whom the goods are or have been delivered,
jointly and severally liable with that other carrier for

The original contracting carrier or the delivering carrier,
as the case may be, is entitled to recover from any other

amount of loss or damage that the original contracting

required to pay under this bill of lading resulting from any
loss of or damage to the goods while they were in the
custody of such other carrier.




Remedy by consignor or consignee

carrier.




Exception from liability



Article 5:

The carrier is not liable for the following:




(a)

loss, damage or delay to any of the goods described in this
bill of lading caused by an Act of God, the Queen's or

the goods, the act or default of the consignor, owner or

(b)

unless caused by the negligence of the carrier or the
carrier's agent or employee:





(i)

damage to fragile articles that are not packed and unpacked
by the contracting carrier or by that carrier's agent or
employee(s);

At the time of acceptance of the contract, the original
contracting carrier must provide the consignor with a date

consignee liable for reasonable storage in transit, handling
and redelivery charges incurred by the carrier.

article must be paid by the consignor.




Consignor's risk



Article 11:

If it is agreed that the goods are carried at the risk of
the consignor of the goods, that agreement covers only those
risks that are necessarily incidental to transportation and
the agreement does not relieve the carrier from liability

negligent act or omission of the carrier or the carrier's
agents or employees, and the burden of providing absence of
negligence is on the carrier.




Notice of claim

special agreement and the nature of the goods is not
disclosed on the face of this bill of lading, the carrier is
not liable for any loss or damage.




Freight charges



Article 14:
(a)

If required by the carrier, the freight and all other lawful
charges accruing on the goods must be paid before delivery,
provided that, if the total actual charges exceed by more
than 10% the total estimated charges, the consignee must be
allowed 15 days after the day on which the goods are
delivered (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) to pay
the amount by which the total actual charges exceed 110% of
the total estimated charges.




(b)

The 15 days extension provided in paragraph (a) does not

signed by the consignor.




Dangerous goods



Article 15:

Every person, whether as principal or agent, shipping
explosives or dangerous goods without previous full
disclosure to the carrier as required by law, must indemnify

subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful charges,
including a reasonable charge for storage.




Alterations



Article 17:

Subject to Article 18, any additional limitation on the
carrier's liability on the bill of lading, and any
alteration or addition or erasure on the bill of lading,
must be signed or initialed by the consignor or the
consignor's agent and the original contracting carrier or
that carrier's agent and unless so acknowledged is without
effect.




Weights



Article 18:

It is the responsibility of the original contracting carrier
or that carrier's agent to show the correct tare, gross and
net weights on this bill of lading by use of a certified
public scale, and attach the weigh scale ticket to the
original contracting carrier or that carrier's agent's copy
of this bill of lading. If certified public scales are not
