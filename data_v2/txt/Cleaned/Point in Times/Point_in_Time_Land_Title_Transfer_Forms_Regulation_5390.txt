information must be shown immediately after the transferees' names.
This requirement does not apply where transferees are taking either
as joint tenants or tenants in common in equal shares. Where
transferees take in unequal shares, their respective interests must
be shown as fractions of the interest being transferred and not as
fractions of the whole land. For example, if Item 2 (a) refers to an
"undivided 1/2 interest" and it is intended to apportion that
interest among 3 transferees in unequal shares, the fractional
shares shown in this Item must total to 1.


(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3), assuming that of the
undivided 1/2 interest being transferred, one transferee is to take
1/2 and the others are to take 1/4 each, Item 6 would be completed
as shown in the example.

EXAMPLE:








6.

Transferee(s): (Including occupation(s), postal address(es)
and postal code(s))*






JOHN JONES
, Taxi Driver, of 1234 Yew Street, Vancouver, B.C. V9J 3P6 as

an undivided 1/4 interest, and
SARA JONES
, Teacher, of 999 Maple Street, Vancouver, B.C. V4X 3Z8 as to
an undivided 1/4 interest.










(5) Do not use decimal fractions. A 1/3 interest must not be
expressed as 33.33% or.333.


(6) Preference is for transferee names to be printed or typed in
capitals and underlined as shown in the above examples.


(7) If there is insufficient space to enter names, occupations,
addresses and postal codes of all of the transferees, enter "SEE
SCHEDULE" set out all the names, occupations, addresses and postal
codes in a schedule.

LACK OF CERTIFICATION

(1) If the transferor signature cannot be certified by an officer,
enter "SEE AFFIDAVIT OF EXECUTION" and attach an affidavit that
complies with Part 5 of the
Land Title Act
. Note that the affidavit will be part of Form A and must have a
page number.


(2) The affidavit must state the reason why officer certification
cannot be obtained. The reason must be sufficient for the registrar
to accept the affidavit in lieu of the officer certification. In
those cases where the affidavit evidence of execution is submitted,
the registrar is not likely to exercise his discretion unless
officer certification is simply impossible to obtain under the
circumstances or the transfer was executed outside British Columbia.


(3) In those cases where the freehold transfer document is executed
outside British Columbia, the registrar will accept that it is
difficult to obtain an officer's certification in all cases and will
accept the affidavit of execution in lieu of an officer
certification.

LACK OF CERTIFICATION

enter "SEE AFFIDAVIT OF EXECUTION" and attach an affidavit that
complies with Part 5 of the
Land Title Act
. Note that the affidavit is part of Form B and must have a page
number.

cannot be obtained. The reason must be sufficient for the registrar

officer certification is simply impossible to obtain under the
circumstances or the mortgage was executed outside British Columbia.


(3) In those cases where the mortgage document is executed outside
British Columbia, the registrar will accept that it is difficult to
obtain an officer certification in all cases and will accept the
affidavit of execution in lieu of an officer certification.

LACK OF CERTIFICATION

(1) If the transferor(s)/transferee(s) signature(s) cannot be
certified by an officer, enter "SEE AFFIDAVIT OF EXECUTION" and
attach an affidavit that complies with Part 5 of the
Land Title Act
. Note that the affidavit is part of Form C and must have a page
number.


(2) The affidavit must state the reason why officer certification
cannot be obtained. The reason must be sufficient for the registrar
to accept the affidavit in lieu of the officer certification. In
those cases where the affidavit evidence of execution is submitted,
the registrar is not likely to exercise his discretion unless
officer certification is simply impossible to obtain under the
circumstances or the general instrument was executed outside British
Columbia.


(3) In those cases where the general instrument is executed outside
British Columbia, the registrar will accept that it is difficult to
obtain an officer certification in all cases and will accept the
affidavit of execution in lieu of an officer certification.

What this mortgage does



2

(1)  In return for the

principal amount
to the
borrower
, the
borrower
grants and mortgages the
land
to the
lender
as security for repayment of the
mortgage money
and for performance of all the
borrower's
promises and agreements.


(2)  If the interest mortgaged is described in the
mortgage form
as a leasehold interest, the grant in subsection (1) shall be
construed as a charge of the unexpired term of the
lease
less the last month of that term.

(3)  This means that

(a)
this mortgage
shall be a charge on the land, and


(b) the
borrower
releases to the
lender
all the
borrower's
claim to the
land
until the
borrower
has paid the
mortgage money
to the
lender
, in accordance with these mortgage terms, and has performed all
of the
borrower's promises and agreements.


(4)  The
borrower
may continue to remain in possession of the
land
as long as the
borrower
performs all of the
borrower's promises and agreements.


(5)  When the
borrower
has paid the
mortgage money
and performed all the
borrower's promises and agreements
under
this mortgage
and the
lender
has no obligation to make any further advances or readvances, the
lender
will no longer be entitled to enforce any rights under
this mortgage
and the
borrower
will be entitled, at the
borrower's
cost, to receive a discharge of
this mortgage
. The discharge must be signed by the
lender
and must be registered by the
borrower
in the land title office to cancel the registration of
this mortgage
against the
land.





Interest



3

(1)
Interest
is chargeable on the
mortgage money
and is payable by the
borrower
.


(2)
Interest
is not payable in advance. This means that
interest
must be earned before it is payable.


(3)
Interest
on advances or readvances of the
principal amount
starts on the date and on the amount of each advance or readvance
and accrues on the
principal amount
until the
borrower
has paid all the
mortgage money
.


(4)
Interest
payable on any part of the
principal amount
advanced before the
interest
adjustment date
is due and payable to the
lender
on the
interest
adjustment date.


(5)  At the end of each
interest calculation period,
unpaid accrued
interest
will be added to the
principal amount
and bear
interest.
This is known as compound interest.
