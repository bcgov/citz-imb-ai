To determine the compensation for which the holder of a cutting permit
is eligible under a cutting permit compensation provision, the
minister must do the following:




(a)

specify the harvest profile for the cutting permit area by identifying
the components of the profile of timber that the minister considers
could be harvested in that area, as at the date on which the relevant
timber cruise is conducted, to support the allowable annual cut of the
licence or agreement to which the cutting permit relates;




(b)

determine the volume of harvestable timber that the minister considers
is in the cutting permit area as at the date the relevant timber
cruise is conducted;




(c)

specify the size of the impacted portion of the harvestable cutting
permit area by determining the number of hectares that the minister
considers




(i)

are in the portion of the cutting permit area that is impacted as a
result of the special purpose area designation, and




(ii)

contain harvestable timber as at the applicable impact date;




(d)

specify the size of the total harvestable cutting permit area by

determine the proportion of the cutting permit area that is impacted,
as a result of the special purpose area designation, by using the
formula set out in section 20.






Formula for proportion of cutting permit area impacted




20


The formula for the purposes of section 19 (e) is as follows:




proportion =

impacted portion of harvestable permit area [in hectares]

total harvestable area [in hectares]








where



impacted portion of harvestable permit area [in hectares]

=

determined using the formula set out in section 22,




(b)

the timber were harvested from the harvest profile specified under
section 19 (a)

[matters that minister must determine in respect of cutting permit]

, and




(c)

the timber were harvested and sold in accordance with established
practices.






Formula for annual volume of timber harvested under cutting permit




22


The formula for the purposes of section 21 (a) is as follows:




annual volume =

cutting permit volume

permit term

x proportion of area impacted







where


cutting permit volume
=

the volume of harvestable timber determined under section 19 (b)

[matters that minister must determine in respect of cutting
permit]

;



permit term
=

the number of years in the remaining term of the cutting permit;



proportion of area impacted
=

the proportion of the cutting permit area that is impacted as a
result of the special purpose area designation, as determined
under section 19 (e).









Adjustments to cutting permit compensation to reflect tax and present
value




23

[compensation for cutting permit]
, the net income amounts that would be earned during each year of the
remaining term of the cutting permit, the minister must do the
following:




(a)

for each annual net income amount, determine the after-tax net income
amount in accordance with section 2
[rules for determining after-tax net income amounts]
