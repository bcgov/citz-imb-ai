Limit on harvested volume of partitioned timber




5

(1)


Subject to section 6, if a limit in respect of an AAC partition is to
be specified by minister's order for a forest licence or tree farm
licence, the limit in respect of the partitioned timber must be
determined as an aggregate limit for the term of the minister's order,
as calculated by the following formula:





aggregate limit = licence's proportionate share of AAC x AAC
partition x years








where






licence's

proportionate

share of AAC

=

the licence's proportionate share of the AAC for the timber
supply area or tree farm licence area, as determined in
accordance with subsection (2);




AAC partition
=

the AAC partition, in m
3
;




years
=

the number of years in the term to be specified in the
minister's order and, for this purpose, if the term includes
part of a year, the part must be determined by dividing the
number of days in that part by 365.







(2)

For the purposes of the formulas in subsection (1) and section 6 (2)
(b), a licence's proportionate share of the AAC for a timber supply
area or tree farm licence area is the portion determined by the
following formula:





licence's proportionate share of AAC =

AAC available







AAC of TSA or TFL area







where





AAC available
=

the AAC available to the holder of the licence;





AAC of TSA or

TFL area

=

the AAC determined under section 8 (1)
[allowable annual cut]
of the Act for the timber supply area or tree farm licence area,
as applicable.




[en. B.C. Reg. 237/2017, Sch. s. 3.]





Reduction to limit if excessive volume harvested in pre-order period




6

(1)


The minister may reduce the aggregate limit determined for a licence
under section 5 if, in considering under section 75.02 (4.1)
[partition order]
of the Act the volume of partitioned timber harvested under the
licence since the date the AAC partition took effect, the minister
considers that the reduction is necessary to ensure the AAC partition
is carried out.




(2)

The maximum amount by which an aggregate limit for a licence may be
reduced under this section is the amount equal to the difference
between




(a)

the aggregate volume of partitioned timber harvested under the licence
during the pre-order period, as determined by




(i)

adding the applicable volumes referred to in section 6.2 (1) (a) to
(d)
[determination of harvested volume]
using the sources of information and data set out in section 6.2 (2)
(a) to (g), and




(ii)

excluding the volumes and grades of timber referred to in section 6.3

[exclusion of certain grades and volumes of partitioned timber]

, and




(b)

the volume determined by the following formula:





volume = licence's proportionate share of AAC x AAC partition x
years








where






licence's

proportionate

share of AAC

=

the licence's proportionate share of the AAC for the timber
supply area or tree farm licence area, as determined in
accordance with section 5 (2);




AAC partition
=

the AAC partition, in m
3
;




years
=

the number of years in the pre-order period and, for this
purpose, if the pre-order period includes part of a year, the
part must be determined by dividing the number of days in that
part by 365.







(3)

An aggregate limit for a licence may be reduced under this section
only if the aggregate volume referred to in subsection (2) (a) exceeds
the volume determined under subsection (2) (b).

[en. B.C. Reg. 237/2017, Sch. s. 3.]





Specification of one limit for 2 or more forest licences held by same
person




6.1


For the purposes of section 75.02 (3.1)
[partition order]
of the Act, if aggregate limits on the harvested volume of partitioned
timber are determined under this regulation for 2 or more forest
licences held by the same person, the sum of those aggregate limits
may be specified as one aggregate limit that applies in relation to
those licences.

[en. B.C. Reg. 237/2017, Sch. s. 3.]





Determination of harvested volume




6.2

(1)


For the purposes of the definition of "harvested volume" in section
75.01 (1)
[definitions]
of the Act, if a minister's order specifies an aggregate limit in
relation to a licence, the volume of the partitioned timber harvested
under the licence during the term of the minister's order must be
determined by adding the following, as applicable:




(a)

the volume of partitioned timber cut or removed under that licence and
under road permits associated with that licence, including




(i)

any volume of partitioned timber that, under section 72 (9) or 73 (8)
of the Act, is deemed to be cut or removed under the licence or under
a road permit associated with the licence, and




(ii)

any volume of partitioned timber that, under Division 3.1
[Cut Control]
of Part 4
[General Tenure Revisions]
of the Act, is attributed to another licence or to a road permit
associated with another licence;




(b)

the volume of partitioned timber, other than volume already counted
under paragraph (a) of this subsection, estimated to be wasted or
damaged under that licence and under road permits associated with that
licence, including




(i)

any volume of partitioned timber that, under section 72 (9)
[removal of dead or damaged timber]
or 73 (8)

[removal of dead or damaged timber from a timber supply area]

of the Act, is deemed to be wasted or damaged under the licence or
under a road permit associated with the licence, and




(ii)

any volume of partitioned timber that, under Division 3.1 of Part 4 of
the Act, is attributed to another licence or to a road permit
associated with another licence;




(c)

the volume of partitioned timber cut, damaged or destroyed by the
holder of that licence without authorization;




(d)

the volume of partitioned timber that, under section 22.3

[volume harvested under BCTS licence deemed to be harvested under
non-BCTS licence for cut control purposes]

of the Act, is deemed to be harvested under that licence.




(2)

A minister's order that specifies an aggregate limit in relation to a
licence must set out the sources of information and data to be used,
during the term of the minister's order, in determining the harvested
volume under subsection (1), which sources may include any or all of
the following, as they relate to the licence:




(a)

scales made under Part 6
[Timber Scaling]
of the Act;




(b)

cut control statements issued on behalf of the government;




(c)

stumpage billed by the government;




(d)

waste assessments;




(e)

information provided by a timber cruise;




(f)

assessments made by the holder of the licence, if required under
section 6.4
[minister may require assessments]
of this regulation;




(g)

other assessments, made by or on behalf of the minister, that the
minister considers appropriate.




(3)

If an aggregate limit in relation to a licence is reduced under
section 6

[reduction to limit if excessive volume harvested in pre-order
period]

, the minister's order must set out the following:




(a)

the amount of the reduction;




(b)

the factors considered in making the reduction;




(c)

the sources of information and data used in determining the aggregate
volume of partitioned timber harvested during the pre-order period;




(d)

the end date used in making the determination referred to in paragraph
(c).

[en. B.C. Reg. 237/2017, Sch. s. 3.]





Exclusion of certain volumes and grades of partitioned timber




6.3


Despite section 6.2, in determining the harvested volume for a licence
under that section, the following must be excluded:




(a)

a volume of partitioned timber referred to in section 6.2 (1) (a), (b)
or (c), if that volume of partitioned timber has been attributed to
the licence under Division 3.1 of Part 4 of the Act;




(b)

a volume of partitioned timber determined based on a scale under Part
6
[Timber Scaling]
of the Act, if that volume of partitioned timber is




(i)

grade code Z listed in the Schedule of Coast Timber Grades to the
Scaling Regulation, or




(ii)

a grade code listed in the Schedule of Interior Timber Grades to the
Scaling Regulation, other than grade code 1, 2 or 4.

[en. B.C. Reg. 237/2017, Sch. s. 3.]





Minister may require assessments




6.4


A minister's order that specifies an aggregate limit in relation to a
licence may require the holder of the licence to make assessments, at
specified times during the term of the minister's order, of the volume
of partitioned timber harvested under that licence.

[en. B.C. Reg. 237/2017, Sch. s. 3.]





Increase or waiver of harvested volume limit




7


For the purposes of section 75.03
[increase or waiver of harvested volume limit in order]
of the Act, the minister may increase or waive the harvested volume
limit that is specified for a licence in the minister's order if the
minister is satisfied that the reasons for the increase or waiver meet
one or more of the following criteria:




(a)

the increase or waiver is requested by a first nation with respect to
a licence entered into with that first nation under section 47.3 (1)
(a)
[direct award of specific licences]
of the Act and the minister's order does not meet the objectives
contemplated under the agreement referred to in that section between
the first nation and the government;




(b)

it is necessary or desirable for the holder of the licence to exceed
or be free of the harvested volume limit because the timber is in
danger, as a result of forest health factors, of being significantly
reduced in value, lost or destroyed;




(c)

compliance with the minister's order is inconsistent with a notice
given by the regional manager, in accordance with the terms of the
licence, restricting the holder of the licence from applying for
cutting permits for areas of Crown land that meet the requirements set
out in the regional manager's notice.






Penalty rate




8

(1)


In this section,
"average stumpage rate"
means the average stumpage rate that was applicable to timber
harvested under the licence during the last year in which stumpage was
payable in respect of that timber.




(2)

For the purposes of section 75.05 (2) (b)
[penalty for non-compliance with minister's order]
of the Act, the prescribed rate is




(a)

the average stumpage rate, for that portion of the volume that exceeds
the harvested volume limit by 10% or less, and




(b)

twice the average stumpage rate, for that portion of the volume that
exceeds the harvested volume limit by more than 10%.






Relief from penalty




9


The minister may grant relief from a penalty imposed under section
75.05
[penalty for non-compliance with minister's order]
of the Act if the minister is satisfied that the penalty results from
circumstances that are




(a)

beyond the control of the holder of the licence, and




(b)

unrelated to the holder's financial situation.
