"estuary"
means that portion of a receiving water lying below the farthest point
upstream of detectable changes in water movement or chemistry through
mixing of fresh and salt water and due to tidal action;

for streams and rivers, the point of contact between the stream or
river surface and the shore during the 2-year return period 7-day
flow.

90


A person must not discharge municipal effluent to water unless the
requirements set out in this Part are met.






Initial dilution zone for water generally




91

For flows up to and equaling 2 times the ADWF, treatment and municipal
effluent quality requirements are determined by daily flow multiples
that require secondary treatment.




(3)

If flows are more than 2 times the ADWF during a storm or equivalent
snowmelt event with a less than 5-year return period, a discharger
must




(a)

have a liquid waste management plan or specific study, and

permafrost or freezing ground conditions require roof drains to be
connected to the municipal wastewater collection system, and




(b)

connections must be made in accordance with a practice acceptable to a
local building inspector or an equivalent practice.




(5)

A director may substitute, in accordance with section 8
[director may substitute requirements]
, different requirements for the total phosphorus and orthophosphate
requirements specified in Table 11, as set out in section 94
[municipal effluent quality requirements]
, if an environmental impact study demonstrates that




(a)

receiving waters would not be subject to an undesirable degree of
increased biological activity because of the phosphorus addition,




(b)

lower municipal effluent concentrations than those shown in Table 11
in section 94 are necessary, or




(c)

a mass load criteria may be needed.




(6)

A discharger must determine the maximum allowable municipal effluent

(3)

The median coliform values for 7 consecutive daily tests and any
single value test must be less than the values specified in this
section.






Advanced treatment requirements

Okanagan Basin, and a municipality that discharges into the Okanagan
Basin must not discharge effluent that has a total nitrogen content of
6 mg/L or more.






Enhanced environmental impact study needed




98
