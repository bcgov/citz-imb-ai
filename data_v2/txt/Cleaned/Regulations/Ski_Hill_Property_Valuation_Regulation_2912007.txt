Actual value of designated ski hill property




4


The actual value of a designated ski hill property for a taxation year
is the amount determined by the following formula:

where


"stabilized gross lift revenue"
=

the amount determined under section 5 in relation to the
designated ski hill property for the taxation year;



"conversion factor"
=
the amount determined under section 7.








Stabilized gross lift revenue

In relation to a designated ski hill property, the stabilized gross
lift revenue for a taxation year is the average of the amounts that
are the gross lift revenue of the ski hill operator from that
designated ski hill property for 3 of the 5 previous fiscal years
ending before the taxation year, excluding the lowest and the highest
gross lift revenue amounts of the 5 previous fiscal years.




(2)

For the purposes of determining a ski hill operator's gross lift
revenue from a designated ski hill property for a fiscal year ending
before the designated ski hill property was designated under section
3, the gross lift revenue for the fiscal year is determined in
accordance with section 6 as if the designated ski hill property for
that fiscal year was the land and improvements that would have been
eligible property in that fiscal year.

total stabilized gross lift revenue








where


"total net taxable value"
=
