Part 1 — Minister's Regulation



Division 1 — Interpretation





Classes of pesticides




2


The following classes of pesticides are established:




(a)

permit-restricted pesticides, being those pesticides assigned to this
class under section 43 (1)
[classification of pesticides]
because the administrator considers that the risk of unreasonable
adverse effects from their use should be evaluated for each proposed
use;




(b)

restricted pesticides, being those pesticides that




(i)

are required under the federal Act to be labelled with the product
class designation "RESTRICTED", and




(ii)

are not permit-restricted pesticides or excluded pesticides;




(c)

commercial pesticides, being those pesticides that




(i)

are required under the federal Act to bear a label indicating their
product class designation acceptable under that Act in relation to
their general uses in commercial activities that are specified on the
label as "commercial", "industrial", "agricultural" or another
commercial activity, and




(ii)

are not permit-restricted pesticides or excluded pesticides;




(d)

domestic pesticides, being those pesticides




(i)

that




(A)

are required under the federal Act to be labelled with the product
class designation "DOMESTIC", and




(B)

are not permit-restricted pesticides or excluded pesticides, or




(ii)

that are contained in a fertilizer registered under the

Fertilizers Act

(Canada);




(e)

excluded pesticides, being those pesticides assigned to this class
under section 43 (2)
[classification of pesticides]
because the administrator considers that excluding them from
compliance with the requirements imposed on a licensee, permit holder
or confirmation holder under the Act will not increase the risk of
unreasonable adverse effects from their use.

On request, the administrator may designate a division or other part
of a government corporation as a single entity for the purposes of
this regulation if satisfied that the pesticide uses of the division
or part are operationally distinct from, or otherwise unrelated to,
other pesticide uses of the corporation.




(3)

A designation under subsection (1) or (2) must be in writing.

[en. B.C. Reg. 258/2006, s. 3.]

for service between the person and the owner or manager of the land on
which the pesticide is to be used.
