Assumptions



1

Fuel produced from waste diverted from a landfill


The waste would otherwise be deposited in a landfill that captures
75% of methane emissions.


The methane emissions, before capture, that would otherwise result
from the deposit of the waste in a landfill are 90% of the
emissions specified for the waste in the column headed "Final
(Adjusted) CH
4
Generation, MTCO
2
E/Dry Metric Ton" in Exhibit 6-7 in the Manage Practice Chapters
of the United States Environment Protection Agency's Documentation
for Greenhouse Gas Emission and Energy Factors Used in the Waste
Reduction Model (WARM), version 15, dated November 2020,
as the table read on January 1, 2024



2

Natural gas produced from landfill gas


The landfill gas would otherwise be captured.



3

Natural gas produced from manure


The emissions that would otherwise result from the storage of the
manure are the emissions specified for 2019 by Table 3.B(a)s1 of
the 2021 Common Report Format (CRF) Table submitted by Canada on
April 12, 2021 under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, as Table 3.B(a)s1 read on
January 1, 2024.



4

Natural gas produced from organic waste diverted from composting


The emissions from composting would otherwise be the emissions
specified in Table 4.1 in Volume 5 of the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as the
guidelines read on January 1, 2024.
