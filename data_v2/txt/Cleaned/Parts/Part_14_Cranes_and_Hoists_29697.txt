If it is not practicable, due to the configuration of the workplace,
to position sufficient test weights to test the maximum load limit
switch before the crane is first used on each work shift, the maximum
load limit switch must




(a)

be set to activate at a load of less than 80% of the maximum rated
capacity for the crane and tested using test blocks, and
