Application of risk-based standards for remediation




18

(1)


The remediation standards have been met for a specific contaminated
site if a responsible person satisfies a director that




(a)

for any non-threshold carcinogenic substance, the calculated human
lifetime cancer risk due to exposure to that substance at the site is
less than or equal to a risk value recommended by a medical health
officer for the site, and




(b)

for any substance for which a hazard index is calculated, the hazard
index due to exposure of a human to that substance at the site is less
than a maximum hazard index recommended by a medical health officer
for that site.




(2)

A responsible person who asks a director for a decision that the
standards in subsection (1) have been met for a contaminated site must




(a)

provide information to support and justify the basis for the request,
and




(b)

participate in and pay for a public community based consultation
process facilitated by a medical health officer which




(i)

is for the purpose of developing a recommendation on the acceptable
level of human health risk for the site,




(ii)

will consider remediation options in relation to levels of resulting
human health risk at the site,




(iii)

will be conducted in conjunction with any requirement under section 52
of the Act and section 55 (1) of this regulation, and




(iv)

is carried out over a time period not exceeding 3 months from the date
of the request under subsection (1) unless the person making the
request, a medical health officer and the director agree to an
alternate time period.




(3)

Despite subsections (1) and (2), a director must consider a
contaminated site to have been satisfactorily remediated without
review and recommendation by a medical health officer if




(a)

for each non-threshold carcinogenic substance, the calculated human
lifetime cancer risk due to exposure to that substance at the site is
less than or equal to one in 100 000, and




(b)

for each substance for which a hazard index is calculated, the hazard
index due to exposure of a human to that substance at the site is less
than or equal to one.




(4)

A director must not decide that the standards in subsection (1) have
been met before receiving written recommendations with supporting
rationale from a medical health officer respecting the matters
described in subsection (1) (a) and (b).




(5)

If a person demonstrates to the satisfaction of a director that the
local background concentration of any substance at a particular site
results in the standards required by subsection (1) or (3) being
exceeded, the remediation standards for that substance must be the
calculated lifetime cancer risk and calculated hazard index which
results from exposure of a human to the local background concentration
of that substance at the site.




(6)

A person who applies the risk-based standards of this section must
also prepare an environmental risk assessment report which identifies




(a)

the potential onsite and offsite environmental risks of any substances
causing contamination before and after remediation, and




(b)

procedures, including monitoring, designed to mitigate any significant
potential risks identified in paragraph (a).




(7)

A director may impose requirements on a responsible person to prevent
or mitigate risks identified




(a)

in the environmental risk assessment report required under subsection

the risk to human health due to exposure to that substance at the site
is less than or equal to a maximum value recommended by a medical
health officer for the environmental management area,




(b)

the maximum value recommended by a medical health officer under
paragraph (a) takes a form other than that of a hazard index or cancer
risk, and




(c)

the recommendation under paragraph (a) has been reviewed and endorsed
by the provincial health officer.




(2)

A responsible person who asks a director for a decision that the
standards in subsection (1) have been met for a contaminated site must




(a)

provide information to support and justify the basis for the request,
and




(b)

participate in and pay for a public community based consultation
process, acceptable to and facilitated by a medical health officer,
that




(i)

is for the purpose of developing a recommendation on the acceptable
level of human exposure and health risk for the site,




(ii)

considers remediation options in relation to levels of human exposure
and health risk at the site,




(iii)

is conducted in conjunction with any requirement under section 52 of
the Act and section 55 (1) of this regulation, and




(iv)

is carried out over a time period not exceeding 6 months from the date
of the request under subsection (1), unless the person making the
request, a medical health officer and the director agree to an
alternate time period.




(3)

been met before receiving written recommendations with supporting
rationale from a medical health officer respecting the matters
described in subsection (1) (a) and a written review and
endorsement of the recommendations from the provincial health officer
under subsection (1) (c).




(4)

Despite subsections (1) and (2), the director must consider an
environmental management area to have been satisfactorily remediated
with respect to each substance from a source specified in section 14
without review and recommendation from a medical health officer if




(a)

for each non-threshold carcinogenic substance, the calculated human
lifetime cancer risk due to exposure to that substance at the site is
less than or equal to one in 100 000, and




(b)

for each substance for which a hazard index is calculated, the hazard
index due to exposure of a human to that substance at the site is less
than or equal to one.




(5)

A person who applies the risk-based standards of this section with
respect to specified substances must also prepare an environmental
risk assessment report that identifies




(a)

the potential onsite and offsite environmental risks of each specified
substance before and after the remediation, and




(b)

procedures, including monitoring, designed to mitigate any significant
potential risks identified in paragraph (a).




(5.1)

If a person demonstrates to the satisfaction of a director that the
local background concentration of any substance at a particular
environmental management area results in the standards required by
subsection (1) or (4) being exceeded, the remediation standards for
that substance must be the calculated lifetime cancer risk and
calculated hazard index that result from exposure of a human to the
local background concentration of that substance at the environmental
management area.




(6)

A director may impose requirements on a responsible person to prevent
or mitigate risks identified




(a)

in the environmental risk assessment report required under subsection
(5), or




(b)

by the director using other available data.

administering the property, and




(c)

whether the receiver should seek to terminate the appointment in
accordance with subsection (5) or abandon the contaminated site,


and during that period, subject to subsections (11) to (13), the
receiver is not required to comply with the remediation order or the
pollution abatement order.




(11)

A receiver may, upon giving notice in writing to a director, apply to
the court for an extension of the 30 day period described in
subsection (10), but this provision does not apply if the director
agrees to the extended time proposed by the receiver.




(12)

The court, on hearing an application under subsection (11), must not
order an extension unless it determines that an extension is
reasonably necessary to permit the receiver to ascertain the
environmental condition of the site and the extent and cost of
fulfilling the duties arising from the operation or control of the
site and compliance with the director's order.




(13)

If a director requires compliance with a remediation order or a
pollution abatement order within the 30 day period to reduce the
threat of a contaminated site, the director may, upon giving written
notice to the receiver, seek a court order to reduce the 30 day period
described in subsection (10), but this provision does not apply if the
receiver agrees to the reduced time proposed by the director.




(14)

Despite any other provision in this section, a director may agree to
the continued involvement of a receiver in the remediation of a
contaminated site even if there are insufficient available funds to
satisfy the costs of remediation.
