, a fine imposed in a prosecution for an offence under subsection (3)
of this section is deemed to be a fine imposed for the contravention
of a bylaw of the regional district.




(5)

If a person is convicted of an offence referred to in subsection (1)
(a) or (b), on application by the regional district or another person
for compensation, the court must give consideration to the application
and, in addition to any penalty imposed, may order the person
