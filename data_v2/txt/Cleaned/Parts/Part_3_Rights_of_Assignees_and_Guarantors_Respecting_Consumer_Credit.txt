[SBC 2004] CHAPTER 2



Part 3 â€” Rights of Assignees and Guarantors Respecting Consumer Credit





Assignee's obligations




15

(1)


Subject to subsection (2), an assignee of a right of a supplier in a
consumer transaction has no greater right than, and is subject to the
same obligations as, the assignor respecting the credit given to the
consumer.




(2)

A consumer must not receive from, and is not entitled to set off
against, an assignee of the supplier an amount greater than the
balance owing on the contract at the time of the assignment.






Guarantor has same rights as consumer




16


A guarantor may rely on a defence that is available to a consumer in
an action commenced by a supplier against the guarantor, whether or
not the consumer is a party to the action, but a guarantor must not
use the infancy or bankruptcy of the consumer as a defence.
