Override and application of common law rules

negligence of the worker's fellow workers.

Family Compensation Act

in an action for the recovery of damages for an injury sustained by or
causing the death of the worker while in the service of that worker's
employer for which the employer would otherwise have been liable.




(3)

Contributory negligence on the part of the worker must be taken into
account in assessing the damages in an action.
