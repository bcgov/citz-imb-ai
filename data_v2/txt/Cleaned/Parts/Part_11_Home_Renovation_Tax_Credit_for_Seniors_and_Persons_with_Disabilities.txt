administered or managed by the corporation and that includes the

same time during the taxation year, the total amount of qualifying
expenditures that may be claimed by all of the individuals in respect
of the residence cannot exceed $10 000;




(b)

subject to subsection (7.1), if an individual and the individual's
spouse or common-law partner on December 31 of a taxation year are

to implement the qualifying renovation to which that outlay or expense
is directly attributable begins within a reasonable time after the
outlay or expense is made or incurred.






Part-year residents




143

(1)


An individual who is resident in Canada for only part of a taxation
year is entitled to claim for the year only the amount the individual
would be entitled to claim for the year under section 142

[home renovation tax credit for seniors and persons with
disabilities]

that can reasonably be considered wholly applicable to any period in
the year throughout which the individual was resident in Canada,
computed as though that period were the whole taxation year.

disabilities]

as can reasonably be considered wholly applicable to the taxation
year.




(2)

The sum of all amounts that may be claimed under section 142 for all
taxation years of the individual ending in a calendar year must not
exceed the total amount that the individual would have been entitled
to claim under that section in respect of the calendar year if the
individual had not become bankrupt.




(3)

If an individual becomes bankrupt in a calendar year and, when the
bankruptcy occurs, the individual is not a qualifying individual for
the taxation year that ends at the time of the bankruptcy but becomes
a qualifying individual for the taxation year that ends at the end of
the calendar year, the bankrupt individual is eligible to claim a tax
credit under section 142 for the taxation year that ends at the time
of the bankruptcy.

bankruptcy occurs, the individual is a qualifying relation of another

the calendar year, the bankrupt individual is eligible to claim a tax
credit under section 142 for the taxation year that ends at the time
of the bankruptcy.






Death




145

(1)


If, when an individual dies, the individual is not a senior but would
have become a senior by the end of the calendar year in which the
individual dies, the individual is eligible to claim a tax credit
under section 142

[home renovation tax credit for seniors and persons with
disabilities]

for the taxation year that ends on the date of death.

(3)

If an individual is a qualifying relation of another individual who,
immediately before death, is not a senior but who would have become a

individual who is the qualifying relation is eligible to claim a tax
credit under section 142 for a taxation year that ends in the calendar
year as if the other individual had not died.
