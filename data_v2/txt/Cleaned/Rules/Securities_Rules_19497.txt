disclosure first occurred;




(d)

Add the amounts determined under paragraph (c) for each class of

respect of the determination of profit made or loss avoided, an
offender not receive the benefit of, and not bear the burden of,
market changes unrelated to the offender's misconduct;




(c)

that, in recognition that it may take a period of time for the impact
of an offender's misconduct, or for the information that is the basis
for the misconduct, to be fully reflected in the market valuation of a
security or derivative, the determination of profit made or loss
avoided be based on market valuations over the period of time
necessary to reflect the impact of the misconduct or the information;




(d)

that all direct and indirect profits made, and all direct or indirect
losses avoided, be accounted for in the determination.
