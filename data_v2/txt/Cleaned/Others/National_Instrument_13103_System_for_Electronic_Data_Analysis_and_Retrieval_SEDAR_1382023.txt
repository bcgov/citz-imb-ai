Profile requirements




4

(1)


Before a person or company transmits a document through SEDAR+ for the
first time, the person or company must file a profile by transmitting
it through SEDAR+.




(2)

If information contained in a profile becomes inaccurate, the person
or company must file an updated profile with the accurate information
by transmitting it through SEDAR+ at the earlier of




(a)

the next time the person or company transmits a document through
SEDAR+ after the date on which the person or company knew or
reasonably should have known that the information contained in the
profile is inaccurate, and




(b)

10 days after the date on which the person or company knew or

Payment of fees




5

(1)

authority or regulator that would be the principal regulator if Part 3
of Multilateral Instrument 11-102

through SEDAR+ a Form 45-106F1
Report of Exempt Distribution
, and the person or company does not have a head office in Canada or
