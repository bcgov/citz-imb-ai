Notice regarding a business location that is a residence



For the administration of securities legislation or derivatives
legislation, including commodity futures legislation, or both, the
regulator or, in Québec, the securities regulatory authority may require
access to the business location to review the books, records and
documents of the registered firm. If applicable, the SRO may also
require access to the business location for the administration of the
rules of the SRO.


If the business location specified in this form is a residence, the
regulator, securities regulatory authority or SRO may request consent to
enter the residence.


If consent is not provided, it may affect the ability of the regulator,
securities regulatory authority or SRO to access the books, records or
documents of a registered firm and to determine whether securities
legislation, derivatives legislation (including commodity futures
legislation) or the rules of the SRO are being complied with. As a
result, the regulator, securities regulatory authority or SRO may take
action if it is unable to access and review the books, records or
documents of a registered firm held at the business location.

Notes:


Form 31-103F1
Calculation of Excess Working Capital
must be prepared using the accounting principles that you use to prepare
your financial statements in accordance with National Instrument 52-107
Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards
. Section 12.1 of Companion Policy 31-103CP

Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant
Obligations

provides further guidance in respect of these accounting principles.


Line 5. Related-party Debt
— Refer to the CPA Canada Handbook for the definition of "related party"
for publicly accountable enterprises. The firm is required to deliver a
copy of the executed subordination agreement to the regulator or, in
Québec, the securities regulatory authority on the earlier of (a) 10
days after the date the agreement is executed or (b) the date an amount
subordinated by the agreement is excluded from its calculation of excess
working capital on Form 31-103F1
Calculation of Excess Working Capital
.

The firm must notify the regulator or, in Québec, the securities
regulatory authority, 10 days before it repays the loan (in whole or
in part), or terminates the subordination agreement.

See section 12.2 of National Instrument 31-103

Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant
Obligations

.


Line 8. Minimum Capital
— The amount on this line must be not less than (a) $25,000 for an
adviser and (b) $50,000 for a dealer. For an investment fund manager,
the amount must be not less than $100,000 unless subsection 12.1 (4) of
National Instrument 31-103

Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant
Obligations

applies.


Line 9. Market Risk
— The amount on this line must be calculated according to the
instructions set out in Schedule 1 to Form 31-103F1
Calculation of Excess Working Capital
. A schedule supporting the calculation of any amounts included in Line
9 as market risk should be provided to the regulator or, in Québec, the
securities regulatory authority in conjunction with the submission of
Form 31-103F1
Calculation of Excess Working Capital
.


Line 11. Guarantees
— If the registered firm is guaranteeing the liability of another party,
the total amount of the guarantee must be included in the capital
calculation. If the amount of a guarantee is included in the firm's
statement of financial position as a current liability and is reflected
in Line 4, do not include the amount of the guarantee on Line 11.


Line 12. Unresolved Differences
— Any unresolved differences that could result in a loss from either
firm or client assets must be included in the capital calculation. The
examples below provide guidance as to how to calculate unresolved
differences:


(i) If there is an unresolved difference relating to client securities,
the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the fair value of
the client securities that are short, plus the applicable margin rate
for those securities.


(ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the registrant's
investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the
fair value of the investments (securities) that are short.


(iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the amount
to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the shortfall
in cash.


Please refer to section 12.1 of Companion Policy 31-103CP

contracts, sales of banking and insurance products and services).

2. Reportable outside activities


Instructions: Consider all of the activities that you participate in

is business-related. Activities performed for an affiliated entity are

raising money for an entity through the issuance of securities or
derivatives or promoting the sale of an entity's securities or
derivatives outside of your activities with your sponsoring firm or
another registered firm, complete a separate Schedule D for each entity
for which you performed these activities.

of securities or derivatives are considered to be directly involved in
