force as a valid bylaw until it is repealed or amended, unless the
amendment is adopted after a regulation under subsection (2) has
continued the necessary authority.




(2)

If a bylaw is continued under subsection (1), a local government that

to the bylaw and the Lieutenant Governor in Council may make
regulations for that purpose.
