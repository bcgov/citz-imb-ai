Law is in effect.
8.5.2

First Nation may refer the matter to be finally determined by arbitration in accordance with

Two.
8.5.4
Access to extract Groundwater on Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands
requires the consent of the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation.
8.6.0  HYDRO POWER RESERVATIONS
8.6.1
In addition to the Maa‑nulth First Nation water reservations
established in accordance with 8.2.1, on the Effective Date, British Columbia will establish

power purposes including related storage purposes, as follows:
a. in favour of Huu‑ay‑aht First Nations, for five years after the Effective

If a Maa‑nulth First Nation applies for a Water Licence for
hydro power purposes and any related storage purposes in relation to a water reservation
established for that Maa‑nulth First Nation in accordance with 8.6.1, British Columbia will
grant the Water Licence if the proposed hydro power project conforms with Federal Law or
Provincial Law and there is sufficient Available Flow in the applicable specified Stream
subject to that water reservation.
