Motor Assisted Cycle Regulation
Motors
1
The motors of a motor assisted cycle must
(a)
be electric motors,
(b)
have continuous power output ratings that in total do not exceed 500 watts, and
(c)
not be capable of propelling the motor assisted cycle at a speed greater than 32 km/hr on level ground.
[en. B.C. Reg. 56/2018, s. 1.]
Wheels
2
(1)
The wheels of a motor assisted cycle, including the rubber tires that make contact with the ground, must be 350 mm or more in diameter.
(2)
A motor assisted cycle must not have more than 3 wheels in contact with the ground.
[am. B.C. Reg. 202/2022, s. 1.]
Operation of pedals or hand cranks requirement
2.1
The pedals or hand cranks attached to a motor assisted cycle must be capable of being operated while the motors of the motor assisted cycle are engaged and provide assistance propelling the motor assisted cycle.
[en. B.C. Reg. 202/2022, s. 2.]
Motor shut-off requirement
3
(1)
If a motor assisted cycle is equipped with an accelerator controller, the motor assisted cycle must be equipped with a mechanism, separate from the accelerator controller, that
(a)
allows the operator to turn the motors on and off from a normal seated position while operating the motor assisted cycle, or
(b)
prevents the motors from turning on or engaging before the motor assisted cycle attains a speed of 3 km/hr.
(2)
The motors of a motor assisted cycle must disengage and no longer provide assistance propelling the motor assisted cycle as follows:
(a)
if the motors are engaged by pedalling, when the operator stops pedalling;
(b)
if the motors are engaged by hand cranking, when the operator stops hand cranking;
(c)
if the motors are engaged by operating an accelerator controller, when the operator releases or disengages the accelerator controller;
(d)
regardless of how the motors are engaged, when the operator applies a brake.
[en. B.C. Reg. 202/2022, s. 3.]
Generators
4
A motor assisted cycle must not be equipped with a generator, alternator or similar device powered by a combustion engine.
Brake performance requirement
5
(1)
A motor assisted cycle must be equipped with brakes on all wheels or on each axle.
(2)
The braking system must be capable of bringing the motor assisted cycle, while being operated at a speed of 30 km/hr, to a full stop within 9 m from the point at which the brakes were applied.
Drive system and equipment securement
6
The motor drive systems and all energy storage devices of a motor assisted cycle must be secured to prevent movement in any direction relative to the motor assisted cycle while the motor assisted cycle is operating.
[am. B.C. Reg. 56/2018, s. 3.]
Electrical terminals
7
All electrical terminals on a motor assisted cycle must be completely insulated or covered.
