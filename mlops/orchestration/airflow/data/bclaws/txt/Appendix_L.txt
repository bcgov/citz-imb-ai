demand the amount to be changed to that specified in a notice and the Licensee shall, within
60 days of such notice, change the Security to that specified and provide the Owner with
evidence of the change, except that while Security is waived under Section 5.1, this section
shall not apply.
ARTICLE 6 — ASSIGNMENT
6.1 The Licensee shall not assign this licence or sublicense any part of the
Land, without the prior written consent of the Owner, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
6.2 Notwithstanding Section 6.1, the Licensee may, without the prior written
consent of the Owner assign or sublicense its interest in all or a part of the Land to a
British Columbia crown corporation, other governmental agencies or departments and
universities or colleges.
ARTICLE 7 — TERMINATION
7.1 The Licensee further covenants and agrees with the Owner that:
(a) if the Licensee
(i) defaults in the payment of any money payable by the Licensee under this
Agreement, or
(ii) fails to observe, abide by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement
(other than the payment of any money payable by the Licensee under this Agreement), and the
Licensee's default or failure continues for 60 days after the Owner gives written notice of
the default or failure to the Licensee, or
(b) if the Licensee
(i) becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the general benefit of its
creditors,
(ii) commits an act which entitles a person to take action under the
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act
(Canada) or a bankruptcy petition is filed
or presented against the Licensee or/the Licensee consents to the filing of the petition or
a decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudging the Licensee bankrupt
under any law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or
(iii) voluntarily enters into an arrangement with its creditors;
this Agreement will, at the Owner's option and with or without entry, terminate
and the Licensee's right to use and occupy the Land will cease.
7.2 If the condition complained of (other than the payment of any money payable
by the Licensee under this Agreement) reasonably requires more time to cure than 60 days,
the Licensee will be deemed to have complied with the remedying of it if the Licensee
commences remedying or curing the condition within 60 days and diligently completes the
same.
7.3 The Licensee will make no claim for compensation, in damages or otherwise,
upon the lawful termination of this Agreement under Section 7.1.
7.4 The Licensee may deliver a written notice to the Owner cancelling this
Agreement and thereafter the licence and the rights herein granted will terminate 180 days
after the date of receipt by the Owner of such written notice.
ARTICLE 8 — NOTICE
8.1 Any notice required to be given by either party to the other will be deemed
to be given if mailed by prepaid registered mail in Canada or delivered to the address of
the other at the addresses specified for each on the first page of this licence, or at such
other address as a party may, from time to time, direct in writing, and any such notice will
be deemed to have been received if delivered, on the day of delivery, and if mailed, 7 days
after the time of mailing, except in the case of mail interruption in which case actual
receipt is required.
8.2 In order to expedite the delivery of any notice required to be given by
either party to the other, a concurrent facsimile copy of any notice will, where possible,
be provided to the other party but nothing in this section, and specifically the lack of
delivery of a facsimile copy of any notice, will affect the deemed delivery provided in
section 8.1.
8.3 The delivery of all money payable to the Owner under this Agreement will be
effected by hand, courier or prepaid regular mail to the address specified above, or by any
other payment procedure agreed to by the parties, such deliveries to be effective on actual
receipt.
ARTICLE 9 — MISCELLANEOUS
9.1 No provision of this Agreement will be considered to have been waived unless
the waiver is in writing, and a waiver of a breach of a provision of this Agreement will not
be construed as or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach of the same or any
other provision of this Agreement, and a consent or approval to any act requiring consent or
approval will not waive or render unnecessary the requirement to obtain consent or approval
to any subsequent same or similar act.
9.2 No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Owner under this Agreement is
exclusive of any other remedy in this Agreement or provided by law, but that remedy will be
in addition to all other remedies in this Agreement or then existing at law, in equity or by
statute.
9.3 This Agreement shall not entitle the Licensee to exclusive possession of the
Land and the Owner may, for any purpose, grant to others interests in the Land or rights to
enter on or use or occupy the Land, or may otherwise authorize other persons to enter on or
use or occupy the Land, so long as the grant or authorization does not materially affect the
exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder. The question of whether a grant materially
affects the exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder shall be determined by the Owner
acting reasonably. If the Owner, by written instrument, grants a licence, right or interest
to others to use or occupy the Land, such grant will contain a provision identical to
Subsection 3.1 (c) of this Agreement obligating the new grantee to keep the Land in a safe,
clean and sanitary condition satisfactory to the Owner.
9.4 This Agreement extends to, is binding upon and enures to the benefit of the
parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted
assigns.
9.5 Time is of the essence in this Agreement.
9.6 In this licence, unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes
the plural and the masculine includes the feminine gender and the corporation.
9.7 The captions and headings contained in this licence are for convenience only
and are not to be construed as defining or in any way limiting the scope or intent of the
provisions herein.
9.8 If any section of this licence or any part of a section is found to be
illegal or unenforceable, that part or section, as the case may be, shall be considered
separate and severable and the remaining parts and sections of the licence shall not be
affected thereby and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
law.
The parties have executed this Agreement as of the date of reference of this
Agreement.
