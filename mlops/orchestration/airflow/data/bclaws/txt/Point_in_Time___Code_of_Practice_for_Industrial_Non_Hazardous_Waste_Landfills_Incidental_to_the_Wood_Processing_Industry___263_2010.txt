monitoring ground water,
Section 20 (3) and (5) BEFORE amended by BC Reg 179/2021, effective July 7, 2021.
(3)
The procedures for monitoring groundwater under subsection (2) (b) must
(a)
provide for

an assessment of the risk to ground water quality from the large landfill facility,
(ii)
the detection of changes in ground water quality caused by the large landfill facility, and

the volume and characteristics of the waste to be discharged to the large landfill,
(ii)
the location and capacity of the large landfill,
(iii)
the use of ground water that can reasonably be expected to be made,
