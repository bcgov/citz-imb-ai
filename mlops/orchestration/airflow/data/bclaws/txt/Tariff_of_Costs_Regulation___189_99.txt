under section 45 or 48 of the Act but only if those costs

were incurred on or after June 28, 1999, and
(b)

(2)

with section 45 (7) (a) of the Act.
[en. B.C. Reg. 99/2005, s. 2.]
Tariff of costs
3
(1)
If costs are payable under the Act, they must be assessed as follows:
(a)
legal costs must be assessed under Schedule 1;
(b)
real estate appraisal costs must be assessed under Schedule 2.
(2)
When making an assessment of costs under section 45 or 48 of the Act, the reviewer
must allow those costs under the tariff that were proper or reasonably necessary to
conduct the in-progress board proceeding.
(3)
If costs are payable under section 45 of the Act, the board may, when it makes an
adjudication of compensation following a hearing, fix the scale, from Scale 1 to 3 in
section 4
(1), under which the costs will be assessed.
(4)
The board may order that legal costs be assessed on a different scale from real
estate appraisal costs, and may order that one or more steps in the in-progress board
proceeding be assessed under a different scale from that fixed for other steps.
[am. B.C. Reg. 99/2005, ss. 3 and 4.]
Scale of costs
4
(1)
When fixing the scale of costs, the board must have regard to the following
principles:
(a)
Scale 1 is for matters of less than ordinary difficulty or
importance;
(b)
Scale 2 is for matters of ordinary difficulty or importance;
(c)
Scale 3 is for matters of more than ordinary difficulty or
importance.
(2)
When fixing the appropriate scale under which costs will be assessed, the board
may take into account any of the following:
(a)
whether a difficult issue of law, fact or construction is involved;
(b)
whether a difficult appraisal issue is involved;
(c)
whether an issue is of importance to a class or body of persons, or is of
general interest;
(d)
whether the result of the in-progress board proceeding effectively determines
the rights and obligations as between the parties beyond the relief that was actually
granted or denied.
(3)
Subject to section 3 (3), if
(a)
costs are payable under section 45 or 48 of the Act, or
(b)
payment of assessed costs has been agreed to on a settlement but no scale has
been fixed or agreed to,
the costs must be assessed under Scale 2 unless a party, on application, obtains
an order of the board that the costs be assessed under another scale.
(4)
For the purpose of determining legal costs under Schedule 1, the value allowed on an
assessment is as follows:
(a)
Scale 1 - $100 for each unit;
(b)
Scale 2 - $140 for each unit;
(c)
Scale 3 - $180 for each unit.
(5)
For the purpose of determining real estate appraisal costs under Schedule 2,
the value allowed on an assessment is as follows:
(a)
Scale 1 - $80 for each unit;
(b)
Scale 2 - $100 for each unit;
(c)
Scale 3 - $120 for each unit.
(6)
If an item in the tariff provides for maximum and minimum numbers of units, the
reviewer has the discretion to allow a number within that range of units, and must have
regard to the following principles when assessing costs:
(a)
one unit is for matters upon which little time should ordinarily have been
spent;
(b)
the mid-point of the range is for matters upon which an average amount of time
should ordinarily have been spent;
(c)
the maximum number of units is for matters upon which a great deal of time
should ordinarily have been spent.
(7)
If an item in the tariff provides for
(a)
an amount for each day but the time spent during the day is less than 2 1/2
hours, only 1/2 of the amount is allowed for that day,
(b)
an amount for each day but the time spent during the day is more than 5 hours,
the amount allowed for that day must be increased by 1/2 of the amount, or
(c)
an amount for preparation for an attendance but the time spent on the attendance
is less than 2 1/2 hours, only 1/2 of the amount for preparation is allowed.
[am. B.C. Reg. 99/2005, s. 4.]
Expenses and disbursements
5
(1)
In addition to the costs allowed on a review under the tariff, the reviewer may
allow a reasonable amount for expenses and disbursements that were necessarily and
properly incurred in the conduct of the in-progress board proceeding.
(2)
Subject to subsection (4), if tax is payable by a party in respect of legal or real
estate appraisal costs, the reviewer must allow an additional amount calculated on the
monetary value of the units assessed equal to the percentage rate of tax
payable.
(3)
Subject to subsection (4), if tax is payable by a party in respect of expenses or
disbursements, the reviewer must allow an additional amount calculated on the monetary
value of the expenses or disbursements assessed equal to the percentage rate of tax
payable.
(4)
If a person claims an additional amount under subsection (2) or (3) for tax
imposed under Part IX of the
Excise Tax Act
(Canada) payable on          legal or real estate appraisal costs or on expenses or disbursements, that person must
provide proof that
(a)
the person is not a registrant under the
Excise Tax Act
(Canada),            and
(b)
the person is not entitled to and cannot claim reimbursement of any tax imposed
under Part IX of the
Excise Tax Act
(Canada) paid in            respect of the costs, expenses or disbursements to which the additional amount claimed
relates.
(5)
In the absence of the proof required by subsection (4), no additional
amounts for tax imposed under Part IX of the
Excise Tax Act
(Canada) payable on          costs, expenses or disbursements is allowed under subsection (2) or
(3).
(6)
An allowance must not be made for interest on legal or real estate appraisal costs
or expense or disbursement claims.
