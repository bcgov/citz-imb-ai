Improvements exempt from taxation
2
(1) 							The following improvements on lands referred to in section 1 are exempted from property tax levies under any Act:
(a) paved runways, paved taxiways and paved common-use aprons for fixed-wing aircraft;
(b) sidewalks and other paving not otherwise included under paragraph (a) that are used for community airport purposes;
(c) airport navigation aids, including runway lights and unenclosed communication towers;
(d) perimeter airport fencing;
(e) lights and light standards.
(2)
As an exception, an exemption under subsection (1) does not apply to improvements held or occupied by a person other than the operator of the community airport.

For greater certainty, a structure or work that is a building designed primarily for the shelter of people, living things, plant or personal property is not an improvement to which an exemption under subsection (1) may apply.
