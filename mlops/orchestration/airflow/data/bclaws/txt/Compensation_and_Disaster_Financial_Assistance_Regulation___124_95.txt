Multiple claims for assistance for repair
29
If assistance has been provided under this regulation on 2 occasions to repair, rebuild or replace a public facility in a disaster prone area, the local government body seeking assistance to repair, rebuild or replace the public facility is ineligible to receive that further assistance unless the minister determines that, after the second claim was made, the local government body took all corrective or preventive actions that could reasonably have been taken to avoid recurrence of the damage or destruction.
No assistance for structures in flood plain area
30
If an area is designated under the
Municipal Act
as flood plain and a public facility is built or installed in that area after the area has been so designated, no assistance will be provided to repair, rebuild or replace the public facility if it is damaged in a flood unless the structure was determined by the Minister of Environment, Lands and Parks or by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to have been properly flood protected.
Claimant must act to protect property

Assistance for an accepted claim may be reduced or denied if the minister determines that the local government body claimant took no or insufficient action to protect the claimant's property before, during or after the occurrence of a disaster.
Effect of litigation on payment of assistance
32
(1)
If civil litigation is initiated by a local government body claimant to recover some or all of the loss, costs or damages suffered as a result of a disaster, assistance must not be paid to the claimant under this regulation unless
(a)
before payment of the assistance, the claimant agrees, in a manner satisfactory to the Provincial Emergency Program, that if judgment is awarded to the claimant in the litigation and the judgment includes an award in respect of an eligible expense for which assistance is provided, the claimant will repay to the government the portion of the amount recovered under the judgment that is attributable to that eligible expense up to a maximum amount repayable under this paragraph of the amount of assistance received by the claimant in respect of that eligible expense, or
(b)
the assistance is paid after the conclusion of the litigation in an amount that reflects the recovery made by the claimant under the judgment.
(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1) (a), if less than the full amount of the judgment referred to in that subsection is recovered by the claimant, the portion of the amount recovered under the judgment that is attributable to an eligible expense is the proportion of the amount recovered that the judgment awarded in respect of the eligible expense bears to the whole of the judgment amount awarded.
Division 4 — Process for Payment of Assistance
Payment process generally
33
(0.1)
In this section and section 34,
"advance payment"
, in respect of a project, means an advance payment of the assistance that may be provided under this section to a local government body in respect of the project.
(1)
If a disaster occurs for which assistance may be provided under this Part, a local government body that intends to make a claim for assistance must
(a)
promptly notify the Provincial Emergency Program that it will be seeking assistance under this section, and
(b)
specify the purposes for which that assistance will be sought.
(2)
The Provincial Emergency Program must, after reviewing the notice provided by a local government body under subsection (1), notify the local government body as to whether it is eligible to receive some or all of the requested assistance.
(3)
A local government body that has provided a notice under subsection (1) and that has been advised under subsection (2) that it is eligible for assistance under this section must, promptly after being advised of its eligibility, submit a recovery plan to the Provincial Emergency Program detailing the various projects it intends to undertake for cleanup and restoration and the recovery plan may be phased if the works detailed in the plan will take time to complete.
(4)
A recovery plan submitted under subsection (3) must include
(a)
an estimate of the response costs,
(b)
for each project within the recovery plan, a description of the damage incurred, the work to be done and an estimate of the costs required to restore a public facility to pre-disaster condition,
(c)
an identifying project number assigned by the claimant to each project in the recovery plan, and
(d)
any other information the Provincial Emergency Program may require.
(5)
Recovery plans must be approved by the Provincial Emergency Program before implementation, and any work undertaken before that approval is given may ultimately be determined to be ineligible for assistance.
(6)
The Provincial Emergency Program may appoint persons to act as adjusters and to conduct on-site assessments to confirm the damage described and costs estimated in the recovery plan.
(7)
The Provincial Emergency Program may, in respect of a recovery plan submitted for approval, approve the plan as submitted, approve the plan subject to terms and conditions that the Provincial Emergency Program may impose or reject the plan and must, after approving or rejecting the plan,
(a)
notify the local government body of that decision, and
(b)
if the plan is approved or is approved subject to terms and conditions, notify the local government body that funding for the approved plan will be made available in accordance with this section.
(8)
After it receives notice under subsection (7) that its recovery plan has been approved, the local government body must, at any time that it becomes aware that it will require assistance in an amount greater than the amount estimated in its recovery plan, notify the Provincial Emergency Program in writing of the increased funding, by project, stating the amount required and why the increase is needed.
(8.1)
After a local government body receives notice under subsection (7) that its recovery plan has been approved, the local government body may request an advance payment of the assistance that may be provided to the local government body in respect of a project referred to in the recovery plan, other than for a claim described in section 26.
(8.2)
After a request for an advance payment has been submitted under subsection (8.1), the Provincial Emergency Program must review the request and must notify the local government body, in writing, of the results of that review and, if an advance payment is to be provided, the total amount of the advance payment that is to be provided to the local government body in respect of the project.
(8.3)
In providing an advance payment to a local government body, the Provincial Emergency Program
(a)
may provide the advance payment in phases, and
(b)
must not provide an advance payment that, in total, is greater than 50% of the estimated total amount of assistance payable in respect of the project.
(9)
Subject to subsection (10), claims made under this section in respect of a project referred to in the recovery plan may be submitted to the Provincial Emergency Program
(a)
on the completion of that project, or
(b)
if the project is phased as contemplated by subsection (3), at the end of each phase.
(10)
All claims under this section must be submitted within 18 months after the date of the approval notice provided by the Provincial Emergency Program under subsection (7).
(11)
Claims submitted under subsection (9) must be prepared on the following basis:
(a)
recovery plan projects required to restore facilities must be distinguished and recorded separately from ongoing maintenance and other routine repair work;
(b)
accounts must be maintained separately by project numbers assigned in the recovery plan;
(c)
accurate time sheets for labour and equipment must be kept by project number to assist in the calculation of eligible costs;
(d)
all invoices for goods and services must be kept by project number and must be accompanied by statements indicating the reason for purchasing the goods and services and their applicability to recovery operations.
(12)
After a claim has been submitted under subsection (9), the Provincial Emergency Program must review the claim and must notify the local government body, in writing, of the results of that review and, if some or all of the claim has been accepted, of the amount of assistance that is to be provided to the local government body in respect of that claim.
(13)
After determining the amount of assistance that is to be provided to a local government body under this section, the Provincial Emergency Program must, subject to subsection (14), promptly provide payment of that amount to the local government body along with an explanation as to how the final amount was determined and the reasons for the deletion of any claimed items.
(14)
If an advance payment has been provided under this section to a local government body in respect of a project for which a claim has been accepted under subsection (12), the Provincial Emergency Program must deduct the amount of the advance payment from the amount of assistance that is to be paid to the local government body under subsection (13) in respect of that claim.
[am. B.C. Reg. 110/2022, s. 7.]
Recovery of overpayment
34
(1)
If a local government body uses any portion of an advance payment for purposes unrelated to the project in respect of which the advance payment was provided, the portion of the advance payment used for unrelated purposes is an overpayment that may be recovered as a debt due to the government from the local government body.
(2)
If a local government body that received an advance payment does not submit a claim under section 33 in respect of the project within the period set out in section 33 (10), the amount of the advance payment is an overpayment that may be recovered as a debt due to the government from the local government body.
(3)
If the total amount of an advance payment provided to a local government body in respect of a project exceeds the total amount of assistance that is to be provided to the local government body in respect of the project, the excess is an overpayment that may be recovered as a debt due to the government from the local government body.
(4)
For certainty, the Provincial Emergency Program may recover an overpayment referred to in subsection (1) or (3) from a local government body before the local government body submits a claim under section 33 in respect of the project.
