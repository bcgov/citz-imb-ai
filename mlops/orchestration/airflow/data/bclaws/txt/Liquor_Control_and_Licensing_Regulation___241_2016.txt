If a licensee who holds a wine store licence is required by the terms and conditions to report to the general manager the amount the licensee receives from the sales of liquor, the renewal fee for the wine store licence is based on the amount of the liquor sales in the 12-month period that ends 6 months before the expiry of the licence.
(4)
If the operations of a licensee started less than 18 months before the expiration of the licence being renewed, the amount to be used as the amount spent on liquor purchases or the amount received from liquor sales for the 12-month period that ends 6 months before the expiration of the licence is calculated in accordance with the following:
Amount of liquor purchases or sales for the 12-month period
= A ÷ B × 365
where
A
is
the total amount spent on liquor purchases or received from liquor sales by the licensee during the 12-month period;
B
is
the number of days calculated by determining the months that the licensee was in operation during the 12-month period and then totaling the number of days in those months.

includes a former licensee and a deemed licensee referred to in section 52 of the Act;

includes a former permittee referred to in section 53 of the Act.
Contravention
2
(1)
A contravention in respect of a licensee refers to a licensee's contravention of a provision of the Act or this regulation, or a licensee's failure to comply with a term or condition of the licence, that is set out under the heading "Contravention" in the table to this Schedule.
(2)
A contravention in respect of a permittee refers to a permittee's contravention of a provision of the Act or this regulation, or a permittee's failure to comply with a term or condition of the permit, that is set out under the heading "Contravention" in the table to this Schedule.
Type of contravention
3
A contravention is of the same type as another contravention if each contravention falls within the same item in the table to this Schedule.
First, second and subsequent contraventions — licensee
4
(1)
A contravention is a first contravention in respect of a licensee if
(a)
the contravention was committed at or in respect of an establishment under the licensee's licence or an event site under an authorization held by the licensee, and
(b)
the licensee has not committed a contravention of the same type at or in respect of that establishment or any event site under an authorization held by the licensee within the 24-month period preceding the commission of the contravention.
(2)
A contravention is a second contravention in respect of a licensee if
(a)
the contravention was committed at or in respect of an establishment under the licensee's licence or an event site under an authorization held by the licensee, and
