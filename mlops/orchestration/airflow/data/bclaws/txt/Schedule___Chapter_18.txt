Nation's own source revenue contribution to the funding of Agreed-Upon Programs and Services
contemplated by 18.1.2d., taking into account the following:

for that Maa‑nulth First Nation to generate revenues;

should decrease over time as it becomes more self-sufficient; and
f. other matters as agreed to by that Maa‑nulth First Nation, Canada and British
Columbia.
18.1.5
In negotiating each Maa‑nulth First Nation's own source
revenue contribution to the funding of Agreed-Upon Programs and Services in accordance with

Maa‑nulth First Nation, Canada and British Columbia to be funded from that special purpose
fund;
vi. gifts or charitable donations;
vii. amounts received as compensation for specific losses or damages to property
or assets;
viii. Specific Claim Settlements; and
ix. other sources agreed to by that Maa‑nulth First Nation, Canada and British
Columbia; and
b. own source revenue arrangements will not permit:
i. Canada to benefit from a decision of British Columbia to vacate tax room or to
transfer revenues or tax authorities to that Maa‑nulth First Nation; or
ii. British Columbia to benefit from a decision of Canada to vacate tax room or
to transfer revenues or tax authorities to that Maa‑nulth First Nation.
18.1.6
If a Maa‑nulth First Nation, Canada and British Columbia do
not reach agreement on a subsequent Fiscal Financing Agreement by the expiry date of an
existing Fiscal Financing Agreement, that Fiscal Financing Agreement:
a. continues in effect for up to two years from its original expiry date, or for
such other period of time as that Maa‑nulth First Nation, Canada and British Columbia may
agree to in writing; and
b. terminates on the earlier of:
i. the expiry of the extended term determined in accordance with a.;
or
ii. the date of commencement of a subsequent Fiscal Financing
Agreement.
18.1.7
None of the creation of each Maa‑nulth First Nation
Government, the inclusion of Maa‑nulth First Nation Government law-making authority in this
Agreement, nor the exercise of a Maa‑nulth First Nation Government law-making authority
creates or implies any financial obligation or service responsibility on the part of any
Party, other than as described in a Fiscal Financing Agreement.
18.1.8
For greater certainty, where a Maa‑nulth First Nation, Canada
and British Columbia agree in the initial Fiscal Financing Agreement that Canada will
provide Time Limited Federal Funding for any responsibilities of that Maa‑nulth First Nation
specified in that agreement and Canada duly provides the Time Limited Federal Funding,
Canada has no obligation to negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on the provision of
further funding for any of those responsibilities.
18.1.9
For greater certainty, where a Maa‑nulth First Nation, Canada
and British Columbia agree in the initial Fiscal Financing Agreement that British Columbia
will provide Time Limited Provincial Funding for any responsibilities of that Maa‑nulth
First Nation specified in that agreement and British Columbia duly provides the Time Limited
Provincial Funding, British Columbia has no obligation to negotiate and attempt to reach
agreement on the provision of further funding for any of those
responsibilities.
18.1.10
Any funding required for the purposes of the Fiscal Financing
Agreement, or any other agreement that is reached as a result of negotiations that are
required or permitted under any provision of this Agreement and that provides for financial
obligations to be assumed by a Party, is subject to the appropriation of
funds:
a. in the case of Canada, by the Parliament of Canada;
b. in the case of British Columbia, by the Legislature; or
c. in the case of a Maa‑nulth First Nation, by its Maa‑nulth First Nation
