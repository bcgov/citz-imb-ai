In this regulation:
"charge"
means a development cost charge imposed under section 559 (1) of the

means every person on whom a charge is imposed.
[am. B.C. Reg. 98/2018, Sch. 2.]
Payment may be by instalment
2
A developer liable to pay a charge may elect to pay it by instalments, subject always to the conditions set out in sections 3 to 7.
Exception
3
Section 2 does not apply where the charge is under $50 000 unless the council has by bylaw authorized that all charges under $50  000 imposed within its jurisdiction may be paid by instalments in accordance with this regulation.
Payment of charge in full
4
The developer shall pay the charge in full within 2 years after the date that the subdivision is approved or the building permit is granted by paying not less than
(a)
1/3 of the total charge at the time of the approval of the subdivision or granting of the permit, and
(b)
1/2 of the balance within one year after the date of the approval of the subdivision or granting of the permit.
Failure to pay instalment

Where a developer elects to pay the charge by instalments and fails to pay an instalment within any time required for payment by section 4, the total balance of the charge becomes due and payable immediately.
Interest

No interest is payable on the unpaid balance of a charge until it becomes due and payable, but when it does, it is a condition of election under section 2 that interest is payable from that date until payment at the rate or rates prescribed under section 11 (3) of the

Financial Institutions Act
, or
(b)
a bond of an insurer that has a business authorization issued under the
