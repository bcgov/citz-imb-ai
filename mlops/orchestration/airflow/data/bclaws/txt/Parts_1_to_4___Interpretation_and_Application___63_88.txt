Division 8 — Disposal in a Secure Building
Siting requirements
33
(1)
A person must not locate a secure building within a wetland area or an area immediately adjacent to a wetland so that natural drainage from the secure building would flow directly into a wetland area.
(2)
A person must not locate a secure building where it cannot be constructed
(a)
entirely above the seasonally high water table, and
(b)
with a minimum a separation depth of 3 m of unsaturated soil material with a permeability less than 1 x 10
-6
cm/s above a seasonally high water table including the zone of capillary rise.
(3)
A person must not locate a secure building where it would be underlain by less than 5 m of fine grained unconsolidated material with a permeability of less than 1 x 10
-6
cm/s over fractured or permeable bedrock formations (e.g. sandstone, limestone, dolomite).
(4)
A person must not locate a secure building within 100 m of any nonintermittent watercourse or any other permanent waterbody.
(5)
A person must not locate a secure building within
(a)
a designated community water supply watershed, Category I, as defined in
Guidelines for Watershed Management of Crown Lands used as Community Water Supplies
,
(b)
the Greater Victoria Water District watershed, or
(c)
the Greater Vancouver Water District watershed.
[am. B.C. Reg. 375/2008, ss. 1 and 12.]
Operational requirements
34
(1)
The owner of a secure building must
(a)
at appropriate times during construction and installation inspect
(i)
synthetic liners to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of punctures, blisters or tears,
(ii)
floors, walls, doors, hatches and roofs for defects, and
(iii)
clay liners for imperfections (e.g. lenses, cracks, channels)
which would increase permeability,
(b)
during operation inspect weekly and immediately after any catastrophic event all floors, walls, doors, hatches, roofs and drainage control facilities, for evidence of deterioration, malfunction, leaks or improper operation, and
(c)
immediately repair or correct any defects or malfunctioning works as determined by any inspections specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) so as to maintain the integrity of all works.
(2)
The owner of a secure building must carry out an approved monitoring program by
(a)
establishing a groundwater monitoring system with a sufficient number of wells, installed at appropriate locations (upgradient and downgradient) and depths, to yield from the uppermost aquifer groundwater samples that
(i)
represent the quality of groundwater that would not be affected by leakage, if any, from a secure building, and
(ii)
represent the quality of groundwater that would be affected by leachate, if any, from a secure building,
(b)
ensuring the quality of groundwater monitoring data by
(i)
casing sampling wells with appropriate materials to ensure the integrity of the boreholes,
(ii)
preventing contamination
(A)
of any part of the well during construction, and
(B)
from the surface during operation, and
(iii)
implementing procedures for
(A)
decontamination of sampling equipment,
(B)
sample collection,
(C)
sample preservation and shipment,
(D)
sample custody, and
(E)
analytical procedures and quality assurance,
(c)
selecting indicator parameters (e.g. specific conductance, pH, total organic carbon) and chemical constituents for analysis of groundwater that
(i)
provide a reliable indication of the quality of groundwater below the secure landfill from the perspective of human health hazards and environmental quality,
(ii)
reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste, and
(iii)
provide a reliable indication of movement of any contaminant with groundwater flow,
(d)
sampling groundwater sufficiently often to provide data that is representative of varying groundwater flow conditions, but in any case no less frequently than once every 3 months,
(e)
measuring the groundwater surface elevation each time the groundwater is sampled, and
(f)
reporting monitoring results at intervals specified by a director.
(3)
The owner of a secure building must, as operations proceed, record in tabular and graphic form the exact location and type of hazardous waste in relation to one or more permanently secured datum points and keep this information available for inspection by an officer.
(4)
The owner of a secure building must
(a)
within 3 days after detecting any defects or malfunctioning works, notify a director, and
(b)
within 3 days after receiving monitoring data indicating non-compliance with respect to groundwater conditions, notify a director.
[am. B.C. Regs. 319/2004, ss. 2 and 22; 375/2008, ss. 1 and 12.]
Performance standards
35

The owner of a secure building must not use it to store any waste which is listed in Schedule 3.
(2)
The owner of a secure building must design, construct, install and maintain an approved liner system
(a)
to prevent any migration of leakage from the secure building to any subsurface soil or groundwater during the operating life and closure period,
(b)

(i)
if composed of clay materials, is not less than 0.5 m thick, and
(ii)
if synthetic, is at least 1 mm thick,
(c)
constructed of materials having appropriate chemical properties, strength and thickness to prevent failure due to
(i)
pressure gradients,
(ii)
contact with leakage to which it may be exposed, and
(iii)
stress of installation and operations, and
(d)
placed on base materials capable of providing support and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner system to prevent failure due to compression, uplift or settlement.
