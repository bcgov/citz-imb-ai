If a Naramata special debt financing service is established, any authorized borrowing is deemed to be borrowing done or authorized in relation to that service and any security issued in relation to the authorized borrowing is deemed to be security issued in relation to borrowing for that service.
(4)
If all or part of the costs of the Naramata special debt financing service are to be recovered by means of a parcel tax under the

that parcel tax is waived under section 360 (4) (b)

of the
Local Government Act
in relation to each of the parcels on which the tax was imposed,
that tax is deemed to be waived in relation to the parcels, owned at that time by the same person or persons, in relation to which, in accordance with subsection (4) (b), no parcel tax was imposed.
(11)
Despite section 375 of the
Local Government Act
, the regional district may, by bylaw, establish how the parcel tax imposed under this section is to be dealt with if a parcel subject to the tax is subdivided, including establishing that the parcel tax is to be imposed on only one of the parcels created by subdivision or that the tax is to be apportioned in accordance with the bylaw.
