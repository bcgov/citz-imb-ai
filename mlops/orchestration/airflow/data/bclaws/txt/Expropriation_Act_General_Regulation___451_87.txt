Security interests

For the purposes of section 37 of the Act, the court shall establish the value of a security interest in the expropriated land by determining the market value of the security interest at the date of expropriation referred to in section 29 of the Act.

When the amount owing to the security holder is greater than the market value of the security holder's security interest and there is no collateral security other than the covenant of the purchaser or borrower to pay the amount of the debt, the security interest shall be deemed to be fully paid, discharged and satisfied on payment to the security holder of the market value of the security interest.
(3)
When the amount owing to the security holder is greater than the market value of the security holder's security interest and there is collateral security other than the covenant of the purchaser or borrower to pay the amount of the debt, and whether that collateral is by way of security on other property or a guarantee of a third party or otherwise, the compensation shall not fully discharge the debt and the court shall determine the balance remaining and the manner in which it is to be repaid.
(4)
When the expropriation is of a part of land that is subject to a security interest, the court must determine the market value of the expropriated part and must allocate the compensation between the security holder and the other owners as it considers just in the circumstances.
