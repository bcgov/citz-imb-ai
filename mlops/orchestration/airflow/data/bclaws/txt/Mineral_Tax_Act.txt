(2)
The commissioner may file a certificate under this section with a district
registrar of the Supreme Court and, when filed, the certificate has the same effect and

it.
Recovery of tax by attachment of amounts owed to operator
35
(1)

suspects that a person is about to advance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, or

paid.
(3)
If under this section the commissioner demands that a person pay to the
commissioner, on account of the liability under this Act of an operator, money otherwise
payable by the person to the operator as interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an
annuity or other periodic payment, the demand
(a)
applies to all of those payments to be made by that person to the operator until
the liability under this Act is satisfied, and
(b)
operates to require payments to the commissioner out of each payment of the
amount stipulated by the commissioner in the demand.

name, the demand under subsection (1), (2) or (3) may be
addressed to the name or style under which the person carries on business and, in the case

employed at the place of business of the addressee.

If persons carry on business in partnership, the demand under subsection
(1),
(2) or (3) may be addressed to the partnership in its name
and, in the case of personal service, is deemed to have been validly served if served on
one of the partners or left with an adult person employed at the place of business of the
partnership.

chattels

or the agent must sell at public auction the property distrained or as much of it as may
be necessary.

If the property distrained is sold for more than the amount of the tax and costs
and no claim to the surplus is made by any other person on the ground that the property
sold belonged to that person or that the person was entitled by lien or other right to the
surplus, the surplus must be paid to the person in whose possession the property was when
the distress was made and that person's receipt must be taken for it.
(6)
If a claim is made by the person for whose taxes the property was distrained and
the claim is admitted, the surplus must be paid to the claimant and the claimant's receipt

otherwise.
