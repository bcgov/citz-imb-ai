The boundaries of a placer title shall be measured and the area of the placer title shall be determined by establishing its lines running from or through the No. 1 post and from or through the No. 2 post, at right angles to the location line, and by establishing its side lines parallel to the location line. (see figure 12)
Figure 12. Maximum size of a placer claim.

(b) 1 000 m for a placer title issued on or after June 1, 1975,
the surveyor shall establish the effective position of the No. 2 post at a point on the location line a distance specified in section 3 (a) or (b), as the case may be, from the No. 1 post but shall not disturb the actual position of the No. 2 post.
(4)
Where during the conduct of a survey, it is found that
(a) either of the posts of a placer title is on a previously located placer title or on a boundary of a previously located placer title,
(b) the boundary line of a previously located placer title is not at right angles to the location line of the placer title being surveyed, and
(c) the area of the placer title being surveyed, including a fraction created, does not exceed
(i)  32.37 ha for a placer title located prior to June 1, 1975, or
(ii)  50 ha for a placer title located on or after June 1, 1975,
the British Columbia land surveyor conducting the survey shall include the fraction created along the boundary touched or crossed by the location line within the placer title being surveyed.
Locating placer claims
13
(1)
On request, a gold commissioner shall furnish a person with a set of 2 metal tags, one embossed "PLACER INITIAL POST (No. 1)" and the other embossed "PLACER FINAL POST (No. 2)". (see figure 13)

(2) 						Every placer claim shall be marked on the ground by the locator by
(a) placing an "PLACER INITIAL POST (No. 1)" called "No. 1" and "PLACER FINAL POST (No. 2)" called "No. 2" from which the location of the placer claim is determined,
(b) securely affixing to the squared surface of that side of the No. 1 post which faces in the direction of the No. 2 post, that portion of a the metal tag embossed "PLACER INITIAL POST (No. 1)" and legibly and permanently impressing on it the following information:
(i)  the name given to the placer claim;
(ii)  the name of the locator;

(vi)  a statement of the number of metres or lying to the right or to the left, or both, of the location line determined when facing the direction of the No. 2 post,
(c) marking the location line between the No. 1 and No. 2 posts by blazing standing trees on 2 sides approximately facing the No. 1 and No. 2 posts and by cutting underbrush or marking the line between the posts in as permanent a manner as conditions permit, so that, from each mark on the line, the next mark on the foresite is visible and, similarly, the last mark on the backsite is also visible, and
(d) securely affixing to the squared surface of that side of the No. 2 post, which faces in the direction of the No. 1 post, that portion of the metal tag embossed "PLACER FINAL POST (No. 2)" and legibly and permanently impressing on it the following information:
(i)  the name given to the placer claim;
(ii)  the name of the locator;
(iii)  the name of the person for whom the locator is acting as an agent, if any
(iv)  the distance from the No. 1 post;
(v)  the date and time of day of completion of the location. (see figure 14)
(3)
Where a cairn of stones is used for the No. 1 post or No. 2 post, the metal tag, with the information impressed on it in accordance with subsection (2) (b) and (d), shall be placed securely within the cairn of stones.
(4)
The location of a placer claim shall be considered complete only after the No. 1 post has been placed, the No. 2 post has been placed or witnessed and the location line has been marked in accordance with this regulation.
(5)
For purposes of the Act, the legal corner post of a placer claim is the No. 1 post.

(a) placing a witness post for the No. 2 post on the location line as close as possible to where the No. 2 posts should have been placed,
(b) legibly and permanently marking the side of the witness post that faces in the direction of the post being witnessed, with the following information:
(i)  the words "No. 2 WITNESS POST";
(ii)  the direction and distance to the true position of the No. 2 post, and
(c) affixing to the squared surface of the side of the witness post that faces in the direction of the No. 2 post being witnessed the metal tag embossed "PLACER FINAL POST (No. 2)" and legibly and permanently impressing on it the information required under section 13 (1) (d). (see figure 15)
