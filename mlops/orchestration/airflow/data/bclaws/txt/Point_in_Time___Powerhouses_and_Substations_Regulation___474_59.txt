(6)
Low voltage protection
— All motors so employed or arranged that an unexpected starting of the motor is a hazard, except those with an emergency use and where the opening of the circuit may cause a special hazard, such as exciter or condenser pump motors, shall be equipped with low voltage protection which will automatically open the motor circuit when the voltage falls below an operating value.
(7)
Low voltage releases
— Where the speed control of direct current motors is accomplished by varying the field resistance, and the nature of the load and the range of the field rheostat are such as to make a dangerous speed attainable and no speed limit devices are used, the field rheostat shall be arranged with low voltage releases or other devices so that the motor cannot be started or continued in operation under dangerously weakened field, except where the operation of such a device might result in serious injury to service or apparatus.

Conductors of more than 750 volts in conduit or sheathing
— Conductors operating at more than 750 volts (unless separately supported and effectively isolated by elevation or by enclosing in suitable compartments or screens) shall be suitable metal-sheathed cable, run in metal conduits or suitable fire-resistive ducts or compartments, with the metal sheathing permanently grounded. Other covering may be used in suitable grounded metal conduit or insulating duct when installed in dry locations. The conduit or duct shall provide a smooth runway, with smooth outlets. Metal conduit, if used, shall be made electrically and mechanically continuous with the metal casings of all conduit fittings. If not exposed to moisture, a metal sheath need not be continuous over splices, provided that the sheaths are suitably bonded together electrically around the splice by a conductor having current capacity not less than No. 6 copper.

Open Conductors of More than 750 Volts
— When any open insulated conductors of more than 750 volts, or any open bare conductor of more than 300 volts to ground, are necessarily brought closer to the floor-line than the clearances required for isolation by elevation, they shall be guarded by permanent screens, by enclosing partitions or by suitable barrier-guards. Where barrier-rails only are used, the surrounding floors shall be provided with suitable insulating platforms, mats or covers.
(5)
When even at less than 300 volts to ground, bare conductors shall be guarded if not isolated by elevation, wherever liable to be short-circuited or grounded by conducting tools or other objects.

29
(1)
Conductors in locations where inflammable gas normally exists shall be in metal conduit or metal-sheathed cable. All fittings and outlets of such conduit and cable shall be electrically and mechanically continuous with the conduit or metal sheath, and the conduit shall be sealed to prevent entrance of gases.
(2)
This rule does not apply to conductors of large cross-section which obviously cannot be placed in conduit, such as copper bars connecting large cells with end-cell switches.
(3)
Conductors in damp locations, if neither in conduit nor in waterproof metal sheaths in other suitable ducts, shall be effectively isolated and supported on a suitable type of insulator.

Disconnectors
33
(1)
Unless a circuit breaker or switch operating on a circuit of over 750 volts makes an air-break, there shall be installed between it and the source of energy supply a suitable air-break disconnector, or equivalent device having an air-gap suitable for the operating voltage of the circuit.
(2)
An air-break disconnector shall be inserted in each conductor between electrical equipment or lines, and sources of supply of more than 750 volts, if the equipment or lines may be worked on while the sources may be alive.

(5)
Switch-blades shall maintain such alignment under service conditions that they can be closed with a single unhesitating motion. The minimum size of blade for any disconnecting switch shall be 1" x 5/32".
(6)
Safety catches shall be provided on disconnecting switches when mounted in such a way that gravity tends to open them, and also when the magnetic forces due to short circuits are of values liable to open them.
Accidental closing
34
(1)
All types of switches shall be so installed as to minimize the danger of accidental operation, and, where practicable, so that gravity cannot close them. Such switches as may tend to close by gravity shall be provided with a proper latch or stop-block to prevent accidental closing.
(2)
Circuit breakers, switches and disconnectors shall be so arranged that they can be secured or blocked in the open position, or plainly tagged to prevent careless closing while work is being done on equipment controlled by them.
(3)
Locking is recommended rather than blocking wherever parts of equipment are remote from the point of control.
Where switches are required
35
Suitable switches or circuit breakers which may be manually operated shall be inserted in all leads (except a grounded conductor) to generators, motors, transformers (except instrument transformers), and all outgoing supply circuits, except as listed below:
(a) in most cases the switch called for should be capable of opening the circuit under overloads; in some cases, as between generators and transformer banks used with them, disconnectors only may be required;
(b) where 2 or more pieces of electrical supply equipment or supply lines are operated as a single unit, no switch is necessarily required between them;
(c) when switches in transformer vaults are unnecessary for operating requirements, permission for their omission may be given;
(d) in certain cases permission may be given for omission of switches from generator field-leads, and for some classes of generators single-pole switches may be used.

(1)
All circuit leads to motors, constant-potential generators, transformer primaries (except series transformers), and station auxiliaries, and all outgoing circuits, shall, except as provided in (2) and (3) below, be protected from excessive current by suitable fuses or automatic circuit breakers or approved type fuses.
(2)
A motor-driven generator or a rotary converter, if adequately protected from excessive load by fuses or automatic circuit breakers in the motor leads or the primary supply leads, may not require such devices in the generator or secondary leads.
(3)
No fuses or circuit breakers are required in the following cases:
(a) grounded conductors;
(b) field-excitation circuits;
(c) leads of alternating current generators;
(d) leads connecting 2 or more pieces of electrical supply equipment operated as a single unit;
(e) circuits supplying interconnected three-wire systems of direct current distribution;
(f) circuits the opening of which may cause greater hazard to life or property through interruption of service.
Fuse protection
37
(1)
All fuses, except those in two-wire circuits operating at not more than 150 volts between conductors and carrying not more than 30 amperes, shall be made "dead" before handling; and shall always be made "dead" before handling, regardless of voltage and current, in locations where a person may have to stand on grounded surfaces when re-fusing. This rule requires an individual switch ahead of every fusible cut-out as specified for the purpose of disconnecting the fuses of each circuit from all sources of supply.
(2)
Combined disconnectors and fuses and protected type fuses up to 2 500 volts, which can be handled without subjecting the hand of the operator to proximity to unprotected live parts, and with which danger of grounding to metal case in the process of operating is adequately eliminated, need not have separate air-break switches ahead of them.
Arcing or suddenly moving parts
38
(1)
Fuses and circuit breakers shall, as far as possible, be so located and shielded that persons will not be burned by their operation.
(2)
Parts of equipment which move suddenly in such a way that persons in the vicinity are liable to be injured by being struck by them, such as handles, levers or other parts of circuit breakers, shall be guarded or isolated.
Accessibility and indicating arrangements
39
(1)
All circuit breakers, switches, fuses, starting rheostats and other control devices shall be readily and safely accessible to authorized persons unless remotely controlled. They shall be so arranged or marked as to identify the equipment controlled by them, and, with the exception of fuses, shall indicate whether they are open or closed.
(2)
The control devices for switches shall indicate whether switches are open or closed. Lever-operated circuit breaker type switches shall be equipped with indicating device to show whether they are open or closed whenever the position of the handles does not clearly do so.

(4)
Switchboards shall have the number of bare parts at different potentials on any panel reduced to a minimum and these parts shall be effectively separated.
Guarding live parts on switchboards
44
(1)
All switchboards operating at more than 300 volts to ground and located near passageways shall be guarded from these by suitable enclosures or barriers, and shall (unless under constant attendance during operation) be made inaccessible to other than authorized persons.
(2)
For the protection of the operator, where parts of more than 300 volts to ground are not otherwise guarded or isolated by elevation, suitable insulating floors, mats or platforms providing good footing shall be so placed that the operator cannot readily touch the live parts unless standing on such floors, mats or platforms.
(3)
No switchboard shall have exposed on its face within 6 feet from floor-line any current-carrying part of more than 750 volts, except as noted in paragraph (5) below, and excepting direct current railway boards not exceeding 1 500 volts, which, where exceeding the nominal 750 volts, shall be so constructed that the operator cannot inadvertently touch parts of more than 750 volts. Dead-face panels and remote control are recommended as means for accomplishing this result where isolation by elevation is impracticable or undesirable.
(4)
When working space adjacent to live parts cannot be provided in accordance with above rule, suitable guards shall be arranged to protect the operator from accidental contact with parts of more than 300 volts. Suitable insulating guardrails, sufficiently spaced from the face or back of the board, or suitable guards perpendicular to the face or the back of the board, and extending out beyond the live parts, shall be used where practicable.
(5)
Plug-type switchboards shall, except while connections are being changed, have no current-carrying part exposed on face of boards, and if practicable they and their plug connectors shall be so arranged where the operating voltage exceeds 150 as to have all current-carrying parts guarded so long as they are alive, even while connections are being changed.
(6)
No switchboard shall have current-carrying parts of more than 7 500 volts exposed (unguarded), unless these parts are effectively isolated by elevation, except at times when occasionally left exposed by removal of covers or entrance into enclosures, such as switch and instrument-transformer cells or compartments, which are ordinarily unoccupied by persons. For such parts, if exposed while alive for any purpose (including buses and disconnectors in compartments), working space shall be provided complying with the requirements stated under Regulation 12.
Section 8 — Lightning Arresters
Location
45
(1)
Lightning arresters shall be attached to all ungrounded sides of each system of more than 7 500 volts connected to overhead circuits, except circuits in cables with grounded metal sheath.
(2)
This rule need not be complied with in locations where thunderstorms are infrequent at all seasons of the year.
(3)
Lightning arresters with auxiliaries, when installed inside of buildings, shall be located well away from all other equipment, passageways and combustible parts of buildings.
Provisions for disconnecting
46
(1)
Lightning arresters on circuits of more than 2 000 volts shall be so arranged, isolated and equipped that they may be readily disconnected from the line by air-break manual disconnectors, having air-gaps of not less than 4 times the equivalent needle-point sparking distance in air of the operating voltage of the circuit to which the arresters are connected, and never less than 7 inches.
(2)
Lightning arresters, unless provided with disconnectors which are always opened before work is done on the arresters, shall be so arranged that necessary adjustments are possible (without approach to current-carrying parts) through the use of permanently grounded mechanisms or suitable insulating appliances. Where charging or adjusting must be done with arresters alive, permanently grounded mechanisms or suitable insulating appliances shall always be provided.
(3)
All choke-coils, gap-electrodes or other attachments inherent to the lightning protective equipment shall have an insulation from the ground, or other conductors equal at least to the insulation demanded at other points of the circuit in the station.
Connections and groundings
47
(1)
Line connections and ground leads shall be run as directly as possible, and be of low impedance and ample current capacity.
(2)
Kinks, coils and sharp bends in the wires between the arresters and the outdoor lines shall be avoided.
(3)
Lightning arrester ground connections shall not be made to the same artificial ground as circuits or equipment but shall be spaced at least 20 feet therefrom. The combined resistance of the ground wires and ground connection shall not be less than 25 ohms. In the case of driven-pipe grounds, at least 2 pipes not less than 7 feet apart shall be used.
Section 9 — Transmission-line Telephone Protection
Transmission-line telephone protection
48
All telephone equipment which is connected to telephone lines which are carried on the same poles as power wires of over 5 000 volts, or which parallel power lines in such a manner that under normal conditions more than 150 volts are induced between the terminals of the telephone equipment and ground, shall be provided with adequate telephone protective equipment to obviate the possibility of accident from high voltage on the telephone lines.
