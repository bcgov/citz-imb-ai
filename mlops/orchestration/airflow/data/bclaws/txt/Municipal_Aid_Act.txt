Grants
2
(1)
At the times and in the manner the Lieutenant Governor in Council may prescribe, the minister must in each year pay from the consolidated revenue fund to each municipality a grant equal to the product obtained by multiplying the assessed value of Provincial land and improvements on it in the municipality by the rate, including debt, fixed by the municipality in that year for general municipal and regional district taxation purposes.
(2)
The assessed values of Provincial land and improvements on it to be used for the calculation of grants under subsection (1) must be determined by the British Columbia Assessment Authority as at December 31 of the preceding year and the British Columbia Assessment Authority must certify the assessed values so determined to the minister on or before April 15 in each year.
(3)
If, as a result of the change in the method of determining the grant, the grant payable under subsection (1) is less than the grant paid to the municipality in 1977, subsection (1) does not apply and instead the minister must pay from the consolidated revenue fund a grant equal to the grant paid to the municipality on Provincial land and improvements on it in 1977.
