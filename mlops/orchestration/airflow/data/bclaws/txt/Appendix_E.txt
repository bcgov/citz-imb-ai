fixtures, improvements, or chattels outside of the Area of the Works, or damage any crops,
merchantable timber, livestock, drains, ditches, culverts, fences, trails, bridges, or roads
on the Lands, and such damage is not caused as a result of the Grantor's breach of the terms

or permittees, then Hydro will:
(a) compensate the Grantor for such damages, to the extent caused by Hydro;
or

incidental to the business of Hydro in connection with any of the foregoing;
3.0  Right of Way Area
3.1 The parties acknowledge that they have made reasonable efforts to identify
all the existing Works and related Right of Way Area as of the date of this Agreement.
However, as there may still be some Works that were missed in the identification process the
parties agree that for such Works the Grantor grants to Hydro for so long as required, a
right of way over those portions of the Lands upon which such Works are located on the
following terms:
(a) for such Works, Hydro holds the same rights, privileges and obligations as
apply to Hydro for the use of the Right of Way Area and the Area of the Works under this
Agreement, including the right of reasonable access over the Lands for the purpose of
gaining access to such Works; and
(b) the Grantor may at any time require Hydro to attach a revised survey plan to
this Agreement to include those additional portions of the Lands.
4.0  Non-Exclusive Use
4.1 This Agreement will not entitle Hydro to exclusive possession of the Hydro
Right of Way Area or other parts of the Lands and the Grantor reserves the right to grant
other dispositions of any Lands affected by this Agreement, so long as the grant does not
materially affect or interfere with the exercise of Hydro's rights under this
Agreement.
5.0  Protection of the Environment
5.1 Hydro will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement having regard
for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent measures to minimize the danger or
disruption to the Environment.
6.0  Covenants of Hydro
6.1 Hydro covenants separately with the Grantor that:
(a) After the construction of the Works or any relocation of the Works in
accordance with Section 8.1 on or about the Right of Way Area, Hydro will cause that portion
of the Lands used by Hydro for the Works as contemplated in Section 2.1(a) to be surveyed by
a British Columbia Land Surveyor and will deliver such survey plan to the Grantor. Upon the
delivery of such survey plan to the Grantor, that portion of the Lands so surveyed will be
deemed to be the Right of Way Area for purposes of interpreting this Agreement and as
modified under this Agreement from time to time. The Grantor authorizes Hydro and the
registrar of the relevant land title office to do all things necessary in relation to the
filing of the survey plan for the Right of Way Area, including inserting the number assigned
by the relevant land title office to such plan;
(b) Hydro shall pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies, charges
and assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account of Hydro which
relate to the Works and which Hydro is liable to pay;
(c) Hydro shall keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro under this Agreement
in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Lands by Hydro, and on written notice from the Grantor, to make safe,
clean, and sanitary any portion of them that contravene the provisions of this covenant,
provided that Hydro has no obligation to keep any portion of the Lands suitable for use by
anyone except Hydro;
(d) Hydro shall bury and maintain all underground works as may be required so as
not to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(e) Hydro shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize disturbance
of any archaeological material discovered by Hydro on the Right of Way Area, and to
immediately notify the Grantor;
(f) Hydro shall not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in
excavations or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as
backfilling proceeds;
(g) Hydro shall not commit or suffer any wilful or voluntary waste, spoil or
destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon anything that may
be or become a nuisance or annoyance to the Grantor, except to the extent required by Hydro
acting reasonably, to exercise its rights under this Agreement; and
(h) Hydro shall permit the Grantor to enter upon the Right of Way Area at any
time to examine its condition.
7.0  Work Plans
7.1 Except in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended emergency, Hydro
will provide to the Grantor a written work plan describing the proposed work located on,
outside or related to the Right of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work
under this Agreement:
(a) construction of any new Works;
(b) relocation of any Works; and
(c) construction or relocation of any Access Improvements.
In accordance with this Section, prior to undertaking any work, Hydro will
deliver a copy of the work plan to the Grantor for comment by the Grantor. The Grantor will
no more than fourteen (14) days after receiving the work plan, provide to Hydro in writing
any comments that it may have, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to accommodate any
suggestions or requests presented by the Grantor to Hydro provided they do not result in
delays, increased costs or technical difficulties.
8.0  Relocation of Works due to change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for any
reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way Area or the Excluded Right
of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works, then the Grantor will consent to the relocation
and replacement of such Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:
(a) Hydro will before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the Grantor
indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for approval by the Grantor, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable
conditions;
(b) Hydro will take into account any likely material effect of the relocated
Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into account the cost efficiencies of the
location selected by Hydro for the relocated Works in relation to alternative
locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and
(d) if Works are relocated from the Excluded Right of Way Area to the Lands Hydro
will pay the Grantor the fair market value of the new Right of Way Area provided the Grantor
has not caused any portion of such Excluded Right of Way Area to become unsuitable for any
of the Works.
9.0  Relocation of Works at the request of the Grantor
9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right of Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Hydro will relocate any Works in the
Right of Way Area to a new location on the Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Hydro, suitable for use for
the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance and operation, and cost
factors;
(b) the Grantor gives Hydro reasonable notice to permit proper design, planning
and construction of the Works to be relocated;
(c) the Grantor agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses, including costs
of design, supervision and construction (before any relocation, the Grantor will pay the
costs and expenses as estimated by Hydro, with appropriate adjustments based on actuals
after the relocation is complete); and
(d) the rights, liberties and rights of way under this Agreement will extend to
the relocated Works and associated areas.

Hydro shall, in respect of such Right of Way Area:
(a) quit peaceably such Right of Way Area;
(b) remove any Access Improvements no longer required in relation to such Right
of Way Area;
(c) remove all above ground Works from such Right of Way Area within a reasonable
period of time and any Works remaining on that portion of the Right of Way Area will be
absolutely forfeited to and become the property of the Grantor. If the Grantor removes any
remaining above ground Works within four (4) years, Hydro will, on demand by the Grantor,
reimburse the Grantor for all reasonable costs of removal; and
(d) remain liable for any environmental damage to the Lands arising from any
below ground Works that remain on or in such Right of Way Area, except if the Grantor uses
or authorizes the use of any of the remaining below ground Works for any purpose then Hydro
will not be liable for any environmental damage caused by the Grantor's use, or authorized
use; and to the extent necessary, this covenant will survive the termination of this
Agreement.

or permittees, that Hydro will:
(a) compensate the Grantor for such damages, to the extent caused by Hydro;

3.0  Right of Way Area
3.1 The parties acknowledge that they have made reasonable efforts to identify
all the existing Works and related Right of Way Area as of the date of this Agreement.
However, as there may still be some Works that were missed in the identification process the
parties agree that for such Works the Grantor grants to Hydro for so long as required, a
right of way over those portions of the Lands upon which such Works are located on the
following terms:
(a) for such Works, Hydro holds the same rights, privileges and obligations as
apply to Hydro for the use of the Right of Way Area and the Area of the Works under this
Agreement, including the right of reasonable access over the Lands for the purpose of
gaining access to such Works; and
(b) the Grantor may at any time require Hydro to attach a revised survey plan to
this Agreement to include those additional portions of the Lands.
4.0  Non-Exclusive Use
4.1 This Agreement will not entitle Hydro to exclusive possession of the Hydro
Right of Way Area or other parts of the Lands and the Grantor reserves the right to grant
other dispositions of any Lands affected by this Agreement, so long as the grant does not
materially affect or interfere with the exercise of Hydro's rights under this
Agreement.
5.0  Protection of the Environment
5.1 Hydro will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement having regard
for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent measures to minimize the danger or
disruption to the Environment.
6.0  Covenants of Hydro
6.1 Hydro covenants separately with the Grantor that:
(a) After the construction of the Works or any relocation of the Works in
accordance with Section 8.1 on or about the Right of Way Area, Hydro will cause that portion
of the Lands used by Hydro for the Works as contemplated in Section 2.1(a) to be surveyed by
a British Columbia Land Surveyor and will deliver such survey plan to the Grantor. Upon the
delivery of such survey plan to the Grantor, that portion of the Lands so surveyed will be
deemed to be the Right of Way Area for purposes of interpreting this Agreement and as
modified under this Agreement from time to time. The Grantor authorizes Hydro and the
registrar of the relevant land title office to do all things necessary in relation to the
filing of the survey plan for the Right of Way Area, including inserting the number assigned
by the relevant land title office to such plan;
(b) Hydro shall pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies, charges
and assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account of Hydro which
relate to the Works and which Hydro is liable to pay;
(c) Hydro shall keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro under this Agreement
in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Lands by Hydro, and on written notice from the Grantor, to make safe,
clean, and sanitary any portion of them that contravene the provisions of this covenant,
provided that Hydro has no obligation to keep any portion of the Lands suitable for use by
anyone except Hydro;
(d) Hydro shall bury and maintain all underground works as may be required so as
not to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(e) Hydro shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize disturbance
of any archaeological material discovered by Hydro on the Right of Way Area, and to
immediately notify the Grantor;
(f) Hydro shall not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in
excavations or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as
backfilling proceeds;
(g) Hydro shall not commit or suffer any wilful or voluntary waste, spoil or
destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon anything that may
be or become a nuisance or annoyance to the Grantor, except to the extent required by Hydro
acting reasonably, to exercise its rights under this Agreement; and
(h) Hydro shall permit the Grantor to enter upon the Right of Way Area at any
time to examine its condition.
7.0  Work Plans
7.1 Except in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended emergency, Hydro
will provide to the Grantor a written work plan describing the proposed work located on,
outside or related to the Right of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work
under this Agreement:
(a) construction of any new Works;
(b) relocation of any Works; and
(c) construction or relocation of any Access Improvements.
In accordance with this Section, prior to undertaking any work, Hydro will
deliver a copy of the work plan to the Grantor for comment by the Grantor. The Grantor will
no more than fourteen (14) days after receiving the work plan, provide to Hydro in writing
any comments that it may have, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to accommodate any
suggestions or requests presented by the Grantor to Hydro provided they do not result in
delays, increased costs or technical difficulties.
8.0  Relocation of Works due to change
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for any
reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way Area or the Excluded Right
of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works, then the Grantor will consent to the relocation
and replacement of such Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:
(a) Hydro will before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the Grantor
indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for approval by the Grantor, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable
conditions;
(b) Hydro will take into account any likely material effect of the relocated
Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into account the cost efficiencies of the
location selected by Hydro for the relocated Works in relation to alternative
locations;
(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and
(d) if Works are relocated from the Excluded Right of Way Area to the Lands Hydro
will pay the Grantor the fair market value of the new Right of Way Area provided the Grantor
has not caused any portion of such Excluded Right of Way Area to become unsuitable for any
of the Works.
9.0  Relocation of Works at the request of the Grantor
9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right of Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Hydro will relocate any Works in the
Right of Way Area to a new location on the Lands, provided that:
(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Hydro, suitable for use for
the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance and operation, and cost
factors;
(b) the Grantor gives Hydro reasonable notice to permit proper design, planning
and construction of the Works to be relocated;
(c) the Grantor agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses, including costs
of design, supervision and construction (before any relocation, the Grantor will pay the
costs and expenses as estimated by Hydro, with appropriate adjustments based on actuals

Hydro shall, in respect of such Right of Way Area:
(a) quit peaceably such Right of Way Area;
(b) remove any Access Improvements no longer required in relation to such Right
of Way Area;
(c) remove all above ground Works from such Right of Way Area within a reasonable
period of time and any Works remaining on that portion of the Right of Way Area will be
absolutely forfeited to and become the property of the Grantor. If the Grantor removes any
remaining above ground Works within four (4) years, Hydro will, on demand by the Grantor,
reimburse the Grantor for all reasonable costs of removal; and
(d) remain liable for any environmental damage to the Lands arising from any
below ground Works that remain on or in such Right of Way Area, except if the Grantor uses
or authorizes the use of any of the remaining below ground Works for any purpose then Hydro
will not be liable for any environmental damage caused by the Grantor's use, or authorized
use; and to the extent necessary, this covenant will survive the termination of this
Agreement.

1. Upland Owner Consent
UPLAND OWNER CONSENT
TO: Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia, as
represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Lands ("British Columbia")
FROM: [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation]
("____________________")
WHEREAS:
A. [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] is the owner in fee simple of the land
located __________, legally described as [INSERT LEGAL DESCRIPTION] (the
"Upland");
B. British Columbia is the owner in fee simple of the parcel or tract of land
being the foreshore fronting on the Upland and all land covered by water adjoining the
Upland (the "Foreshore");
C. The Upland and Foreshore are adjacent to each other and the [Applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation], as owner of the Upland, is entitled to exercise its riparian right
of access to the Upland by crossing the Foreshore;
D. British Columbia wishes to interfere with the [Applicable Maa‑nulth First
Nation's] riparian right of access to the Upland by authorizing, under _______________
existing license(s) of occupation (collectively, the "Licenses"), the use of the identified
portions of the Foreshore for the following purposes:
(i) log booming and storage operation on the portion of the Foreshore shown
outlined in heavy bold on the attached Schedule "A" ("Log Booming Area") pursuant to a
license dated _____________ and numbered _______________, which has a term expiring
_________________; and
(ii) floating sport fishing resort business on the portion of the Foreshore shown
outlined in heavy bold on the attached Schedule "B" ("Resort Fishing Area") pursuant to a
license dated _____________ and numbered _______________, which has a term expiring
_____________________; and
[Note to Draft: These purposes will need to be amended to reflect the terms of
the actual foreshore tenures]
E. [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] is prepared to consent to such
interference pursuant to the provisions set out below:
NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of ONE
($1.00) dollar and other good and valuable consideration, now paid by British Columbia to
the
[Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] (the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:
1. The [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation], as owner of the Upland, on the terms
set forth herein, hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its
servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees and all those
claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the Licenses, with the [Applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation] right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and repass over the Log
Booming Area and the Resort Fishing Area to gain access to and from the
Upland.
2. The [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] acknowledges and agrees that the
consent hereby given entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents,
contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming through them, in
accordance with the Licenses, to:
(a) construct, erect, place, install, moor, maintain, replace, renovate and
repair buildings, structures, works, improvements and chattels on all or any part of the Log
Booming Area or the Resort Fishing Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with
the purposes authorized and approved in the respective Licences;
(b) do all other acts within the Log Booming Area or the Resort Fishing Area,
reasonably necessary or incidental to the purposes authorized and approved in connection
with the respective Licenses.
3. The [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] or any of its successors or assigns,
as the case may be, will give written notice of this Consent to any person to whom it
proposes to dispose of any portion of the Upland which borders on the Foreshore, which
notice will be received by that person prior to such disposition. Prior to or concurrently
with such disposition, the [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] or any of its successors or
assigns, as the case may be, will obtain a written ratification of this Consent by the
transferee of such portion of the Upland in the same form as this Consent and will deliver
an originally executed copy thereof to British Columbia. For the purposes of this paragraph,
the word "dispose" means any transfer by any method to any person entitled to exercise a
riparian right of access to the Upland.
4. British Columbia covenants and agrees with the [Applicable Maa‑nulth First
Nation's] that nothing in this Consent will be deemed or otherwise construed so as to permit
British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees
and all those claiming through them to enter onto the Upland or to construct, place, erect
or install any buildings, structures, improvements or works thereon.
5. This Consent is effective from and after __________________, 200__ ("Effective
Date") until:
(a) ____________________, or the earlier termination of License No.
______________ in respect of the interference over the Log Booming Area; and
(b) ____________________, or the earlier termination of License No.
______________ in respect of the interference over the Resort Fishing Area.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] and British Columbia
have duly executed this Consent as of the Effective Date.

authorized
