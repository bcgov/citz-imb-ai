1
In this Schedule:
"pensionable earnings"
means earnings paid for periods that qualify as pensionable service;
"pensionable service"
means service for which contributions have been made under section 38 or that has been purchased under section 39.
2
The Part 3 pension plan must be a defined benefit pension plan.
3
The formula for calculating the amount of a plan participant's pension under the Part 3 pension plan must be based on the following:
P = 3.5% x E x S
where
P  is the amount of the annual pension of a plan participant,
E  is the highest 3-year average annual pensionable earnings of the plan participant, and
S  is the number of years plus any portion of a year of pensionable service of the plan participant.
4
The maximum pension that a plan participant may receive under the Part 3 pension plan is 70% of the highest 3-year average pensionable earnings of the plan participant.
5
A person is not entitled to a pension under the Part 3 pension plan unless the person has at least 6 years of service.
6
A plan participant who meets the terms of the Part 3 pension plan is entitled to an unreduced pension at age 65.
7
A plan participant who is at least 60 years of age and is otherwise entitled to receive a pension under the Part 3 pension plan may receive a reduced pension in an amount that is calculated by subtracting, from the unreduced amount, 0.25% of that amount for each month by which the plan participant's age is less than 65 years.
8
(1)
The normal form of pension for a plan participant with a spouse at retirement is "joint life and last survivor", payable for
(a)
the life of the plan participant, and
(b)
the life of the surviving spouse,
but the pension payable to the surviving spouse is reduced, on the death of the plan participant, to 60% of the pension to which the plan participant was entitled.
(2)
The normal form of pension for a plan participant who does not have a spouse at retirement is "single life guaranteed", payable for the longer of
(a)
the life of the plan participant, and
(b)
a term of 10 years.
(3)
Despite subsections (1) and (2), a plan participant who is entitled to a pension payable in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) may elect to be paid the plan participant's pension in another form, but the amount of the pension must be adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of the pension that is otherwise payable in accordance with subsection (1) or (2).
9
The government must pay the plan participant's and the government's contributions under section 38 to the pension plan for any period that disability benefits are payable to the plan participant by the government.
