the use of the improvement.
19.3.5
For greater certainty, the exemption from taxation in 19.3.1

received by the Maa‑nulth First Nation; and
b. becomes payable to the Maa‑nulth‑aht within 90 days and is paid to the

19.5.2 only applies to an Indian during the period that
section 87 of the

If a Maa‑nulth First Nation Government imposes a tax within
Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands and concludes a tax agreement for that purpose with Canada or
British Columbia as contemplated in 19.2.1, 19.5.2 does not apply to the extent that the
Maa‑nulth First Nation Government, Canada or British Columbia, as the case may be, imposes a
tax that the particular taxation agreement specifies is applicable to Maa‑nulth First Nation
Citizens and other Indians within the Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands of the applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation.
