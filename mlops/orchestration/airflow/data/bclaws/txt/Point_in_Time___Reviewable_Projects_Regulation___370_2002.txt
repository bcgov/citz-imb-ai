Environmental Assessment Act
Reviewable Projects Regulation
Part 1 — Interpretation
Definitions
1
In this regulation:
"Act"
means the
Environmental
Assessment Act
;
"applicable table"
, in relation to a new project, a modification to an
existing facility or a dismantling and abandonment of an existing facility, means
whichever of Tables 1 to 15, set out in this regulation, lists in Column 1 the category
of facility within which the new or existing facility fits;
"CWF"
means the contaminant weighting factor set out in Appendix 1
for a permitted contaminant;
"existing facility"
means a constructed or substantially constructed
facility, whether or not operating, but does not include a facility that has permanently
ceased operations and has been abandoned;
"facility"
means one or more physical works or structures that have
been or will be constructed as part of a project;
"foreshore"
means land in tidal or non-tidal areas that, as a result of
the rise and fall of the sea or water in an estuary or stream between the natural
boundary and the ordinary low water mark, is periodically covered by salt water or fresh
water and periodically exposed;
"natural boundary"
has the same meaning as in the
Land
Act
;
"new facility"
means a proposed facility, or a facility for which
construction has begun but which has not started regular operations;
"SIC code"
means the code assigned to a category of projects under the
"Standard Industrial Classification", 1980, Fourth Printing March 1989, published by the
Minister of Supply and Services (Canada);
"stream"
has the same meaning as in the
Water Sustainability Act
;
"submerged land"
means land that lies below the ordinary low water mark
of a stream, marine coast line or estuary and that is normally covered by salt water or
fresh water;
"waste discharge"
means the quantity of gaseous, liquid or solid waste
contaminants introduced into the environment from a facility.
[am. B.C. Reg. 41/2016, s. 27.]
How to calculate total waste discharge
2
(1)
The total waste discharge for a facility is the quantity of waste that is
permitted under the
Environmental Management Act
to be
discharged from the facility.
(2)
The total waste discharge for a facility is calculated by adding the products
obtained by multiplying the CWF for each permitted contaminant by the permitted
discharge rate, in tonnes or other unit of measurement specified in Appendix 1,
for that contaminant.
[am. B.C. Reg. 30/2005, s. 1.]
Reviewable projects prescribed
3
(1)
A new project that is in a category described in Column 1 of the applicable
table is prescribed as a reviewable project if it meets the criteria set out opposite in
Column 2.
(2)
A proposed modification of an existing project that is in a category described
in Column 1 of the applicable table is prescribed as a reviewable project if it meets
the criteria set out opposite in Column 3.
(3)
A proposed dismantling and abandonment of an existing facility that is in a
category described in Column 1 of the applicable table is prescribed as a reviewable
project if it meets the criteria set out opposite in Column 4.
(4)
For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), if a new project or the
modification of an existing project requires construction of a facility before regular
operations can proceed, the time when the new project or the modification must meet the
criteria is by the time the construction is completed.
What assessment of construction includes
4
(1)
Subject to subsection (2) and unless otherwise indicated in the
applicable table,
(a)
an assessment of a new project includes the assessment of the construction,
operation, dismantling and abandonment phases of the project, and
(b)
an assessment of the modification of an existing project includes the
assessment of the construction, operation, dismantling and abandonment phases of the
modified portion of the existing project.
(2)
If an applicable table includes a Column 4 setting out the criteria that, when
met, result in the dismantling and abandonment of an existing project in that category
being prescribed as a reviewable project, an assessment of the construction of a new
project in that category or of the modification of an existing project in that category
does not include an assessment of the dismantling and abandonment phases for projects in
that category.
