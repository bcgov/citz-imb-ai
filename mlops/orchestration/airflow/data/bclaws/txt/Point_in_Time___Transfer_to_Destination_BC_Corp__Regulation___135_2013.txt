4.01 Subject to sections 4.02 and 4.03, the Province will assign to the Corporation, and the Corporation will assume all obligations of the Province under the Assumed Contracts, in each case to the extent permitted by law and by the terms of the Assumed Contracts.

(a) the Corporation will indemnify the Province for any and all losses arising in connection with any action by a third party arising from, in connection with or otherwise with respect to actions taken or failed to be taken by the Province consistent with the Corporation's request under this section,
(b) if the Corporation receives the benefits thereunder, the Corporation will perform and comply with, at the Corporation's cost, all of the Province's obligations incurred during such period under such Foreign Contracts as if the Corporation were the Province thereunder, and

Should additional charges be incurred as a result of the over-booking, Supplier will be responsible for payment of such charges.;
