4.01 Subject to sections 4.02 and 4.03, the Province will assign to the Corporation, and the Corporation will assume all obligations of the Province under the Assumed Contracts, in each case to the extent permitted by law and by the terms of the Assumed Contracts.

(a) the Corporation will indemnify the Province for any and all losses arising in connection with any action by a third party arising from, in connection with or otherwise with respect to actions taken or failed to be taken by the Province consistent with the Corporation's request under this section,
(b) if the Corporation receives the benefits thereunder, the Corporation will perform and comply with, at the Corporation's cost, all of the Province's obligations incurred during such period under such Foreign Contracts as if the Corporation were the Province thereunder, and
(c) immediately after any required consents to assignment are obtained for any such Foreign Contracts, the provisions of section 4.02 will apply to such Foreign Contracts without the need for payment of any further consideration or the taking of any further action.

Purpose:
Product Services, formerly known as Super, Natural British Columbia (SNBC), is an integrated reservation and information program that provides opportunity for reservations to be made on behalf of the Supplier.

1.2 Assist the Supplier with maintaining the Reservation Program as it relates to their Property information, rates, rules and inventory.;
1.3 Provide Property information to visitors at VC's ("Visitors") and to on-line users accessing via the Internet ("Users"). Through the VC's, the counsellors will qualify the requirements of each Visitor and suggest to them the Property that best suits their needs. They will offer suggestions based on a rotation basis determined by the reservation system. It is the counsellor's discretion to provide the Visitor with reasonable alternatives based on what is available.;
1.4 Through the Website, the search criteria entered will deem what is appropriate and it is the sole discretion of the User to select the Property that best suits their needs.;
1.5 Process reservations as requested or agreed to but only after providing check-sum verification (number of digits matches brand & expiry date is appropriate), but not integrity verification (funds available, card stolen etc) on the credit card.;
1.6 Forward an email(s) or fax, based on the Suppliers preference, notifying them of a reservation being made through the Reservation Program. The notification will be sent immediately after a reservation is completed.;
1.7 Inform Visitors / Users who reserve of the Suppliers payment and cancellation policy information, if any, as provided by the Supplier.;
1.8 Send the Supplier a monthly invoice for commissions as calculated in accordance with Section 2.;
1.9 Provide the Supplier with access to reports, via the extranet, to assist them in managing their Property(s).
B. The Supplier agrees to:
1.10 Ensure the Property is approved and enrolled in the current year's HelloBC Listing Program in order to participate in the Reservation Program.;
1.11 Obtain and maintain throughout the term of this Agreement, all applicable licenses necessary to do business in British Columbia. If the Supplier is a management company, will advise Product Services of any deficiencies in the owner's permits and licenses.;
1.12. Notify Product Services immediately of any changes in license or ownership.;
1.13. Through the extranet, be responsible for loading and updating Property Information, to allow the sales channels to provide current information to Visitors / Users and process reservations appropriately.

1.14. Through the extranet, provide inventory and rates on the system for 12 months in advance. In addition, property information must be kept current, including but not limited to, unit amenities, photos and policies.;
1.15. Through the extranet, update Property inventory when units are unavailable due to sold out status ("Close-Outs").;
1.16 The rates offered will be competitive with those being offered through other reservation providers and overall provide fair market value.;
1.17. Through the extranet, acknowledge all new, modified and cancelled reservations.;
1.18. Honour all reservations made by or through the Reservation Program at the rates and conditions for the Property in effect with Product Services at the time the reservation was made.;
1.19. Be solely responsible for any over-booking resulting through no fault of Product Services, and provide within 24 hours, or in the case of same day arrival immediately, find similar, alternative, room in Suppliers own Property or in another Tourism BC approved accommodation for Guest and promptly advise Product Services of the details of such change. Should additional charges be incurred as a result of the over-booking, Supplier will be responsible for payment of such charges.;
1.20. Be solely responsible for verifying credit card information provided by the customer, processing all payments, and negotiating directly with the credit card company if the user does not pay for a reservation whether as a result of cancellation or otherwise.;
1.21. Pay the Product Services commission, as stated in the Fees Section 2.;
1.22.

Reservations must be reconciled and the Ministry is to receive payment for the reconciled amount within 30 days of receipt of such invoice by the Supplier.;
2. Commission Rates
2.1 The Supplier agrees to pay a one time subscription fee of $100.00, plus tax, payable to the Minister of Finance, in advance of the date of this agreement. Your Property will be activated in the system once this fee, along with a signed copy of the Product Sales Reservation Program Agreement, is received.;
2.2 The Supplier agrees to pay the following commission rates on each reservation, upgrade, rescheduling, extension, change and/or cancellation that they receive payment for as follows;
• 10% commission for all reservations made through our Websites (www.hellobc.com); and
• 15% commission for all reservations made through Visitor Centres (VC's).
2.3 These commission rates will apply even if:
• the Supplier changes Guest's rate to a non-commissionable rate at the time of Guest's arrival as Product Services will have sent the Supplier business that it might not have otherwise had.; or
• Guest does not show up for the reservation made and the Supplier charges the Guest according to its cancellation policies.
2.4. The commission rates will be calculated on:
• The updated total if a Guest changes a reservation by extending their stay; or

4.1. This Agreement shall have an initial term commencing at time of signing and will continue until either party cancels this Agreement.

4.2. Product Services will use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain and operate the reservation system during the term of this Agreement. However, if Product Services ceases to operate any of the services referred to herein, either partially or totally, temporarily or permanently, and whether through the fault of Product Services or the reservation system or otherwise, neither Product Services nor any other person or entity associated with Product Services shall be liable for any direct, indirect or consequential damages or losses whatsoever (including loss of business, income or profits) suffered at any time by the Supplier or the Property as a result.;
