Devolution of real estate to personal representatives
77
(1)
Despite a testamentary disposition, if real estate is vested in a person without a right in any other person to take by survivorship, on the person's death it devolves to and becomes vested in the person's personal representatives as if it were a chattel real vesting in them.
(2)
This section applies to real estate over which a person executes by will a general power of appointment as if it were real estate vested in the person.

real estate of the deceased is registered or vested in the deceased without a right in any other person to take by survivorship, or in the deceased's predecessor in title,
the real estate is deemed to have vested in the personal representative of the deceased under subsection (1) or (2), and no further order or grant is necessary.
(7)
Sections 78 to 80 apply to all real estate vested or to be vested by the operation of this section.
Administration of real estate

(a)
the effect of probate or letters of administration as respects chattels real,
(b)
dealings with chattels real before probate or administration, and
(c)
the payment of costs of administration and other matters in relation to the administration of personal estate,
apply to real estate, so far as they are applicable, as if that real estate were a chattel real vesting in the personal representatives.

(5)
Despite subsection (4), if probate is granted to one or some of several persons named as executor, power being reserved to the others or other to prove, the sale, transfer or disposition of real estate may be made by the proving executor or executors without the authority of the court, and is as effectual as if all persons named as executors had concurred in it.
(6)
In the administration of the assets of a person dying on or after June 1, 1921, the person's real estate must be administered in the same manner, subject to the same liabilities for debt, costs and expenses, and with the same incidents as if it were personal estate.

convey the real estate to any person entitled to it as heir, devisee or otherwise.

At any time after the end of one year from the death of the owner of any real estate, if the person's personal representatives have failed on the request of the person entitled to the real estate to convey the real estate to that person, on the application of that person and after notice to the personal representatives, the court may order that the conveyance be made.
(5)
The production of an attested and proved assent by the personal representatives of a deceased owner of registered real estate authorizes the registrar of land titles to register the person named in the assent as owner of the real estate.
Liability of real estate to duty
80
Nothing in this Part affects any duty payable in respect of real estate, or imposes on real estate any other duty than was payable in respect of it immediately before June 1, 1921.

(4)
For the purposes of subsection (1) (c), commissions payable when goods are shipped, delivered or paid for, if shipped, delivered or paid for within the 3 months referred to in that paragraph, are deemed to have been earned in those months.
Ranking of debts and rights of sureties
102
(1)
In the administration of an insolvent estate, all debts due and payable by the deceased at the time of death, and all debts due but not then actually payable, subject to rebate of interest, have the right to rank on the insolvent estate.
(2)
A person who is then liable, as surety or otherwise, for a debt of the deceased and who subsequently pays the debt,
(a)
if the creditor has proved the creditor's claim on the debt, stands in the place of the original creditor, or
(b)
if the creditor has not proved the creditor's claim on the debt, is entitled to prove against the rank on the insolvent estate for the debt to the same extent and with the same effect as the original creditor might have done.
Claims dependent on conditions or contingency
103
(1)
If a creditor of the deceased claims on a contract dependent on a condition or contingency that does not happen before the declaration of the first dividend or distribution of or out of the insolvent estate, a dividend must be reserved on the amount of the conditional or contingent claim, until the condition or contingency is determined.
(2)
As an exception to subsection (1), if it appears to the court by which the administration of the insolvent estate is decreed or ordered that the administration may then be kept open for an undue length of time, the court may direct that the value of the contingent or conditional claim be ascertained before a special referee or arbitrator, to be appointed by the court.
(3)
A referee or arbitrator appointed under subsection (2) has, for the purposes of the appointment, all the rights, powers and authorities given under the
Arbitration Act
, and must make an award.
(4)
After hearing all interested parties, the court may reject or confirm the award under subsection (3).
(5)
If the award is rejected, another special referee or arbitrator must be appointed as provided in subsection (2), to establish the value of the claims, subject to the control of the court, and must make an award.
(6)
If the award is confirmed, the amount mentioned in it must be that for which the creditor ranks on the insolvent estate as for a debt payable absolutely.
Legal priority and rights of secured creditors
104
(1)
In the preparation of a dividend sheet or distribution of or out of an insolvent estate, regard must be had to the rank and privilege of every creditor.
(2)
The rank and privilege of every creditor, on whatever they may be legally founded, must not be disturbed by this Act.
(3)
If a creditor holds security for the creditor's claim from the insolvent estate or the deceased, a dividend must not be allotted or paid to the creditor until the amount for which the creditor ranks as a creditor on the insolvent estate as to dividends from it is established as later provided in this Act.
(4)
In computing the proportion of creditors when the proportion is required to be determined, the amount referred to in subsection (3) is the amount that the creditor is to be held to represent.
Execution not executed in lifetime of deceased
105
(1)
A lien or privilege on an insolvent estate, or any part or portion of it, must not be created for the amount of a judgment debt, or of the interest on it, by the issue or delivery of a writ or process of execution of any kind or nature to any sheriff or other officer lawfully entrusted with it in the lifetime of the deceased, if the due execution of the writ or process took place after the death of the deceased.
(2)
Subsection (2) does not affect any lien or privilege for costs.
Creditor holding security
106
(1)
If a creditor holds security of any kind or nature for the amount of the creditor's debt or claim, or a part of it, from the insolvent estate or the deceased, the creditor must, in the creditor's claim,
(a)
specify the nature and amount of the security in the creditor's claim, and
(b)
on the creditor's oath, put a specified value on the debt or claim.
(2)
Despite Part 5 of the
Personal Property Security Act
, the court in which the administration of the insolvent estate has been decreed or ordered may, after hearing all parties, either
(a)
authorize the retention of the property or effects constituting the security, or on which it attaches, by the creditor at the specified value, or
(b)
require from the creditor an assignment and delivery of the security, property or effects at an advance of 10% on the specified value, to be paid out of the insolvent estate as soon as the security can with ordinary diligence be realized on.
(3)
In either of the cases, the difference between the value at which the security is retained or assumed and the amount of the claim of the creditor is the amount for which the creditor ranks, and which the creditor is to be held to represent as stated above.
(4)
If a creditor holds a claim based on negotiable instruments
(a)
on which the deceased was, and the insolvent estate is, only indirectly or secondarily liable, and
(b)
which is not mature or exigible,
the creditor must be considered to hold security under this section, and must put a value on the liability of the party primarily liable as being the creditor's security for payment.
(5)
If a claim referred to in subsection (4) (a)
(a)
is mature or exigible at the date of the death of the deceased, and
(b)
remains unpaid after that date, whether before or after proof,
the creditor is entitled for ranking to treat the claim as unsecured.
(6)
For all other purposes except ranking, a creditor to whom subsection (5) applies
(a)
must still be considered to hold security within the meaning of this section, and
(b)
for all those purposes, must put a value on the liability of the party primarily liable as being the creditor's security for payment.
(7)
If the deceased was liable as a member of a firm or partnership and the creditor holds security from another member or members of the firm or partnership as security for the creditor's debt or claim, the creditor must be considered to hold security within the meaning of this section.
Mortgages to be assigned to creditor, subject to encumbrances
107
(1)
If the security consists of a mortgage on real estate, or on ships or shipping, the property mortgaged must only be assured, assigned and delivered to the creditor subject to all previous mortgages and liens on it holding rank and priority before the creditor's claim, on the creditor
(a)
assuming and binding himself or herself to pay all the previous mortgages and liens, and
(b)
securing the previous charges on the property mortgaged, in the same manner and to the same extent as they were previously secured on it.
(2)
After the requirements of subsection (1) are met, the holders of the previous mortgages and liens have no further recourse or claim on the insolvent estate.
(3)
If there are mortgages or liens on the property subsequent to those of the creditor, the creditor must only obtain the property if one or more of the following requirements are met:
(a)
the subsequently secured creditors consent;
(b)
the subsequently secured creditors file their claims specifying their security as of no value;
(c)
the creditor pays the subsequently secured creditors the value placed by them on their security;
(d)
the creditor gives security to the satisfaction of the court ordering the administration that the insolvent estate will not be troubled by the claims of subsequently secured creditors.
Debts contracted in respect of different estates
108
If the deceased whose estate is insolvent owes debts both individually and as a member of a partnership or as a member of 2 or more different partnerships, the claims against the deceased rank first on the estate by which the debts they represent were contracted, and only rank on the other estate or estates after all the creditors of the other estate or estates have been paid in full.
