2
(1) 							As provided in this Act and for the raising of a revenue for Provincial purposes, every owner of a mine is to be assessed and taxed on the owner's net income derived from mining operations.
(2)
For the purposes of determining net income derived from mining operations, any income derived from the acquisition, storage or transportation of materials used in the manufacturing of mineral ore or processed mineral ore into any product must be included.
(3)
If the net income for the fiscal year exceeds
(a) in the case of the fiscal year being a full year, $50 000, or
(b) in the case of the fiscal year being less than a full year, the proportion of $50 000 that the number of days in the fiscal year bears to the number in the full year,

(4)
As a limit on subsection (3), the total tax payable under that subsection for a fiscal year must not exceed half the amount by which the entire net income exceeds

(b) the proportion of $50 000 referred to in paragraph (b) if the fiscal year is less than a full year.
(5)
The tax on the net income for a fiscal year is deemed to be the tax for the calendar year in which the fiscal year commenced.
(6)
For the purposes of this section, all mines owned, leased, worked or operated by the same person, or under the same general management or control or the income of which accrues to the same person, are, for the purpose of determining liability to taxation, deemed to be and must be dealt with as one and the same mine and not as separate mines.
(7)
If mining operations are carried on by 2 or more affiliated or associated corporations under the same general management or control or the income of which accrues for the benefit of the same shareholders, the income from the various operations must be combined and dealt with as the income of one and the same taxpayer.

must be reduced by the aggregate of the excluded income.

Assessment may be appealed to minister

(1)
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, a person who objects to the amount at which the person is assessed or who considers that he or she is not liable to taxation, may personally or by agent, within 90 days after the date of the giving of the notice of assessment provided for in this Act, serve a notice of an appeal from it to the minister by mailing it by registered mail addressed to the Commissioner of Income Tax, Victoria, British Columbia.

Irregularity in procedure does not affect assessment
26
An assessment must not be varied or disallowed because of an irregularity, informality, omission or error on the part of a person in the observation of a directory provision up to the date of the issuing of the notice of assessment.
Due date of tax not affected by appeal
27
(1)
Neither the giving of a notice of appeal by a taxpayer or any delay in the hearing of the appeal in any way affects the due date, the interest or penalties or liability for payment provided by this Act for tax that is the subject matter of the appeal or in any way delays the collection of the tax.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), if the tax is set aside or reduced on appeal, the minister must refund to the taxpayer

(b) any additional interest or penalty imposed and paid on the tax or excess.
Tax constitutes a lien in favour of the government

A tax imposed or assessed under this Act forms a lien and charge in favour of the government on the entire assets of the taxpayer or of the taxpayer's estate in the hands of a trustee, effective on the last day of the fiscal year of the taxpayer for which the tax is imposed, and has priority over all other claims of every person, except claims secured by liens, charges or encumbrances registered prior to that date.
(2)
The liens and charges created by this section and their priority are not lost or impaired by
(a) neglect, omission or error of the commissioner or of any agent or officer or by the taking or failure to take proceedings to recover the taxes due,
(b) the tender or acceptance of partial payment of the taxes, or
(c) want of registration.

(b) file the certificate with a district registrar of the Supreme Court.
