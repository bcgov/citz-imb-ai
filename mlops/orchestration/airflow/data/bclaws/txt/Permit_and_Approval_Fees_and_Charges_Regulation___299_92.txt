Permit application fees
2
(1)
A person applying for a permit and a permit holder applying for an amendment to a permit must pay an application fee of $400 at the time the application is submitted.
(2)
An application fee is not refundable by reason only that the permit or amendment is refused.
[en. B.C. Reg. 149/2004, s. 1; am. B.C. Reg. 46/2018, App. 1, s. 3.]
Annual charge for a permit
3
(1)
Subject to section 5, a permit holder must pay annually a charge for each permit held by the permittee.
(2)
Subject to subsection (5), the charge for each permit under subsection (1) is calculated by adding the base fee for the permit type, as specified in Column 2 of Schedule A opposite the permit type in Column 1, to the sum of the fees, calculated in accordance with subsection (3), for each contaminant authorized under the permit.
(3)
The fee for each contaminant under subsection (2) is calculated by multiplying the quantity of the contaminant, determined in accordance with subsection (4), authorized by permit for the 12 months prior to the anniversary date of the permit by the unit fee for that contaminant, as specified in Schedule B, C or D for the applicable payment date as set out in Column 2 opposite the contaminant in Column 1.
(4)
The quantity of each contaminant discharged that is used to calculate the annual charge is determined from
(a)
the maximum authorized discharge rate and concentration specified in the permit or by regulation, and
(b)
the discharge factors as determined in accordance with procedures approved by the director if the permit does not specify the concentration of the contaminants contained in the discharges.
(5)
The charge for each permit under subsection (1) is the base fee for the permit type, as specified in Column 2 of Schedule A opposite the permit type in Column 1, if the permit
(a)
authorizes a discharge under one of the following regulations:
(i)
the Antisapstain Chemical Waste Control Regulation;
(ii)
the Placer Mining Waste Control Regulation, or
(b)
is required under section 3.1 (1) of the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation.
(6)
If a permit is amended after its anniversary date and, as a result, the amount of the annual charge changes, the change to the annual charge takes effect on the next anniversary date.
[am. B.C. Regs. 149/2004, s. 2; 321/2004, s. 32 (c); 60/2012, s. (b); 132/2016, Sch. s. 2; 46/2018, App. 1, s. 4.]
Approval charges
4
(1)
Subject to section 5, a person who holds an approval under section 15 of the Act must pay a charge for each approval held by the person.
(2)
The charge for each approval under subsection (1) is calculated by adding the base fee for the approval type, as specified in Column 2 of Schedule A opposite the approval type in Column 1, to the sum of the fees, calculated in accordance with subsection (3), for each contaminant authorized under the approval.
(3)
The fee for each contaminant under subsection (2) is calculated by multiplying the quantity of the contaminants authorized to be discharged during the period for which the approval is granted by the unit fee for that contaminant, as specified in Schedule B, C or D for the applicable payment date as set out in Column 2 opposite the contaminant in Column 1.

Mines Act

(3)
If a person has posted a reclamation security under the
Mines Act
, the fee for suspended solids is zero.
