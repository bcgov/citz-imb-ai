Explanatory Note for Table of Legislative Changes – 4th Edition
This 4th Edition Table of Legislative Changes (TLC) shows any Act provisions and changes
enacted or brought into force between January 1, 2024 and the date to which this Act
is updated,
enacted between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2023 that are not in force as of
the date to which this Act is updated and were not repealed or superseded as of December 31, 2023,
and
enacted between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2004, or consolidated in the Supplement,
if any, to this Act, that are not in force as of the date to which this Act is updated,
were not inoperative as of December 31, 2004, or were not repealed or superseded as
of December 31, 2023.
See the 1st Edition TLC, 2nd Edition TLC and 3rd Edition TLC, if any, for not-in-force
and in-force provisions and changes from the 1997-2023 period and from the Supplement,

This Table may have 1, 2 or 3 parts: "Changes by Regulation" or "Order"

cites provisions that authorize Changes by Regulation or order in council, "Changes
Not in Force"
(italics)

The "Section" column identifies sections of the Act affected by changes; sections

(see abbreviations below). The "Citation" column cites the enactments making the changes.
The "Into force" column (under "Changes Not in Force") shows how or when the changes
