Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement
CHAPTER 16 — CAPITAL TRANSFER AND NEGOTIATION LOAN
REPAYMENT
16.1.0  CAPITAL TRANSFER
16.1.1
Subject to 16.1.2 and 16.2.2, the Capital Transfer from Canada
to each Maa‑nulth First Nation will be paid in accordance with the applicable Capital
Transfer Payment Plan.
16.1.2
If British Columbia or Canada acquires lands for a Maa‑nulth
First Nation before the Effective Date in accordance with 2.10.26, the Capital Transfer
payment amounts for the Effective Date and the first three anniversaries of the Effective
Date in the Capital Transfer Payment Plan for that Maa‑nulth First Nation will be adjusted
by deducting the amount paid for such lands in a manner described in the notes for
finalizing the Capital Transfer Payment Plans.
16.2.0  NEGOTIATION LOAN REPAYMENT
16.2.1
Subject to 16.3.1, each Maa‑nulth First Nation will make
negotiation loan repayments to Canada in accordance with the applicable Negotiation Loan
Repayment Plan.
16.2.2
Canada may set off and deduct from a payment made in
accordance with 16.1.1 the amount of a repayment to be made in accordance with 16.2.1 on the
same date, except to the extent that the loan repayment amount has been prepaid in
accordance with 16.3.1.
16.3.0  PREPAYMENTS
16.3.1
In addition to any negotiation loan repayment amount required
in accordance with 16.2.1, a Maa‑nulth First Nation may make negotiation loan prepayments to
Canada. All prepayments will be applied to the outstanding scheduled negotiation loan
repayment amounts in consecutive order from the Effective Date. A Maa‑nulth First Nation
will notify Canada of a prepayment at least 30 days before the date of that
prepayment.
16.3.2
The "n" anniversary for which a prepayment is to be applied is
the earliest anniversary for which a scheduled negotiation loan repayment amount, or a
portion thereof, remains outstanding. Any loan prepayment applied to an outstanding
negotiation loan repayment amount, or to a portion thereof, is credited at its future value,
as of the "n" anniversary, determined in accordance with the following
formula:
Future Value = Prepayment * (1+CR)
K
* (1+CR*H/365)
where,
"/" means divided by;
"*" means multiplied by;
"K" is the number of complete years between the date of the prepayment and the
"n" anniversary;
"H" is one plus the number of days remaining in the period between the date of
the prepayment and the "n" anniversary, once the number of complete years referred to in "K"
above has been deducted; and
"CR" is 4.545 percent.
16.3.3
If the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding
amount of the negotiation loan repayment amount scheduled for the "n" anniversary, the
excess is deemed to be a prepayment made on the "n" anniversary so that the future value of
the excess is applied as of the next anniversary in a manner analogous to that described in
this paragraph.
16.3.4
On receipt of a loan prepayment, Canada will issue a letter to
the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation setting out the amount of the prepayment received and
the manner in which it will be applied.

NOTES FOR FINALIZING THE CAPITAL TRANSFER PAYMENT PLANS
These notes do not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these notes is to
enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the amounts to be shown in the final
version of this Schedule. Interest at a rate of 4.545% per annum beginning on Effective Date
and compounded annually was used to establish the provisional payment amounts in each
Capital Transfer Payment Plan.
1. In these notes,
"Revision Date"
means the date 30 days before the Effective Date, or
another date if the Parties agree.
"Signing Date"
means the date on which this Agreement is signed by
the Parties after ratification of this Agreement by the Maa‑nulth First Nations in
accordance with 28.2.1.
"Transition Date"
means the date 15 months after the Signing
Date.
2. If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is less than 15
months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment amount in the Capital Transfer Payment
Plans is adjusted as follows:
provisional payment amount * M/L
where,
"/" means divided by;
"*" means multiplied by;
"L" is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2006 published by Statistics
Canada at the same time that the values used in M are published; and
"M" is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar quarter for
which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the Revision Date.
3. If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is greater than
15 months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment amount in the Capital Transfer
Payment Plans is adjusted as follows:
provisional payment amount * [(P/Q) * (1 + CR)
Y
*
(1+CR*D/365)]
where:
"Q" is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2006 published by Statistics
Canada at the same time that the values used in P are published;
"P" is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar quarter for
which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the Transition Date;
"Y" means the number of complete years between the Transition Date and the
Effective Date;
"D" is the number of days remaining in the period between the Transition Date and
the Effective Date, after deducting the complete years in that period that have been taken
into account in the determination of Y; and
"CR" is 4.545 percent.
The purpose of applying this paragraph is to limit the period for which the
Capital Transfer is adjusted by FDDIPI to the period that ends on the date that is 15 months
after the Signing Date, and to lengthen the period of which the Capital Transfer is adjusted
by the calculation rate to the period between the date that is 15 months after the Signing
Date and the Effective Date.
4. If British Columbia or Canada acquires lands for a Maa‑nulth First Nation in
accordance with 2.10.26 and 16.1.2, on the Revision Date the Capital Transfer payment
amounts for the Effective Date and the first three anniversaries of the Effective Date in
the Capital Transfer Payment Plan for that Maa‑nulth First Nation will be adjusted by
deducting the amount paid (as adjusted for inflation in the equation below), as described in
the following equation. This deduction will occur after the provisional payment plan has
been adjusted for inflation as described in these notes in 2 and 3 above.
T
n
= C

which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the Revision Date; and
"W" is the value of FDDIPI published by Statistics Canada at the same time that
the FDDIPI value above in "M" was published, for the calendar quarter immediately preceding
that calendar quarter in which the land was purchased.
If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is greater than 15
months, then "R" is the amount paid by British Columbia or Canada to purchase lands in
accordance with 2.10.26, multiplied by:
P/V * (1 + CR)
Y
* (1+CR*D/365)
where,
"P" is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar quarter for
which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the Transition Date;

NOTES FOR FINALIZING THE NEGOTIATION LOAN REPAYMENT PLAN
These notes do not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these notes is to
enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the amounts to be shown in the final
version of this Schedule.
The provisional loan repayment amounts are based on total outstanding
negotiation loans and interest accrued up to March 31, 2006. Final negotiation loan
repayment amounts, including any further loans made and interest accrued after March 31,
2006, will be calculated and included in the final loan repayment schedules in accordance
with the following notes.
In these notes:
"
Revision Date
" has the same meaning as in Schedule 1 of
this Chapter.
1. Before the Revision Date, Canada and the Maa‑nulth First Nations will jointly
produce a document capturing the final loan and interest amounts as of the Effective Date
and setting out the amounts of all the loans from Canada to the Maa‑nulth First Nations, all
interest accrued to date, and the relevant terms and conditions of those
loans.
2. On the Revision Date, the provisional negotiation loan repayment amounts in
the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plans are adjusted to final negotiation loan repayment
amounts by:
a) determining the amount of the additional negotiation loans made by Canada to
each Maa‑nulth First Nation which were not included in the calculation of the provisional
negotiation loan repayment amounts and any applicable additional interest accrued since the
provisional negotiation loan and interest amounts were calculated; and
b) prorating and adjusting the additional amounts determined in accordance with
paragraph 2a) for that Maa‑nulth First Nation over the applicable Negotiation Loan Repayment
Plan such that the amounts in the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plans are proportional to
the amounts in the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan and such that each final
Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan incorporates interest on unpaid loan balances at 4.545% per
annum beginning on the Effective Date and compounded annually which is the same rate of
interest used to establish the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan.
3. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in accordance with
paragraph 2, the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plans are amended to incorporate the adjusted
figures and the headings in each Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan are replaced by the
following headings:
