the normal flow rate is the flow rate that results from all operating modes within the processing facility design intent, and
(c)
the accidental flow rate is the highest flow rate that
(i)
results from an uncontrolled or unplanned event, and
(ii)
is the sum of the combined flow rates from all possible uncontrolled or unplanned scenarios that may occur simultaneously.
