Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement
CHAPTER 5 — ACCESS
5.1.0  MAA‑NULTH FIRST NATIONS' RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
5.1.1
Except as modified by this Agreement, each Maa‑nulth First
Nation has the same rights and obligations in respect of public access to its Maa‑nulth
First Nation Lands as other owners of estates in fee simple have in respect of public access
to their land.
5.1.2
Each Maa‑nulth First Nation's liability for public access to
its Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands, other than Maa‑nulth First Nation Private Lands, is
comparable to the liability of the provincial Crown for public access to unoccupied
provincial Crown lands.
5.2.0  DESIGNATION OF MAA‑NULTH FIRST NATION PRIVATE LANDS
5.2.1
On the Effective Date, the Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands
identified for illustrative purposes as "Subject Lands" in Appendix H and legally described
in Part 1 (a) of the applicable Appendices B-2 to B-5 are designated as Maa‑nulth First
Nation Private Lands.
5.2.2
After the Effective Date, each Maa‑nulth First Nation may
designate portions of its Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands as Maa‑nulth First Nation Private
Lands if:
a. that Maa‑nulth First Nation has granted an Interest comparable to an Interest
granted by British Columbia on provincial Crown lands that excludes public access;
or
b. the Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands are used for commercial, cultural, resource
development or other uses that are incompatible with public access.
5.2.3
If a Maa‑nulth First Nation intends to designate its Maa‑nulth
First Nation Lands as Maa‑nulth First Nation Private Lands in accordance with 5.2.2, that
Maa‑nulth First Nation will:
a. provide reasonable notice to British Columbia, Canada and the public of the
proposed designation; and
b. consider any views advanced by British Columbia, Canada or the public in
respect of the proposed designation.
5.2.4
If a Maa‑nulth First Nation intends to change the locations or
boundaries of Maa‑nulth First Nation Private Lands, it will:
a. provide reasonable notice to British Columbia, Canada and the public of the
proposed changes; and
b. consider any views advanced by British Columbia, Canada or the public in
respect of the proposed changes.
5.2.5
If the designation of Maa‑nulth First Nation Public Lands as
Maa‑nulth First Nation Private Lands has the effect of preventing public access to an area
or location to which there is a public right of access under Federal Law or Provincial Law
such as navigable waters or Crown roads, the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation will provide
reasonable alternative means of public access to that area or location.
5.2.6
Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands described as "Subject Lands" in
Appendix I may not be designated by the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation as Maa‑nulth First
Nation Private Lands without the consent of British Columbia.
