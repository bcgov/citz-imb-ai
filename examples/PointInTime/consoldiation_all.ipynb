    "## ðŸ“˜ **Title**: `consolidation_all.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§¾ **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook automates the process of loading **multiple CSV files across multiple consolidation snapshots** of acts and regulations into a Neo4j graph database. It performs the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connects to Neo4j using credentials stored in environment variables.\n",
    "* Iterates through folders containing `rank_*.csv` files for each consolidation snapshot.\n",
    "* Clears existing nodes with the same label (if any) before loading new ones.\n",
    "* Loads each CSV file into Neo4j using `LOAD CSV` and Cypher.\n",
    "* Creates both **vector indexes** and **text indexes** on the loaded nodes to support semantic and keyword search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each consolidation folder (e.g., `consol_42`) gets its own unique label like `consolidation_42_act` or `consolidation_42_reg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“‚ **Before You Run This Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to copy all the CSV files into the Neo4j container so that they are accessible via the `file:///` protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”§ Step-by-step Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Locate your CSV folders**\n",
    "   Typically under:\n",
    "   `./Processed_embeddings/acts/consol_*/rank_*.csv`\n",
    "   and\n",
    "   `./Processed_embeddings/regs/consol_*/rank_*.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Copy the folders into the Neo4j container's import directory**\n",
    "   Assuming your container is named `neo4j`, run the following (adjust path accordingly):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker cp ./Processed_embeddings neo4j:/var/lib/neo4j/import/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Or if using **Podman**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   podman cp ./Processed_embeddings neo4j:/var/lib/neo4j/import/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify inside the container (optional)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker exec -it neo4j bash\n",
    "   ls /var/lib/neo4j/import/Processed_embeddings/acts/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensure APOC is enabled and the import path is correct**\n",
    "   Make sure `apoc.import.file.enabled=true` and `dbms.directories.import=/var/lib/neo4j/import` are set in your `neo4j.conf`."
