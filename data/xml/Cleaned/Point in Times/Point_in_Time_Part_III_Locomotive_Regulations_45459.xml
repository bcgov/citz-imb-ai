          <sectiontext>Every railway company will be held responsible for the general condition of all locomotives under its control. The mechanical officer in charge at each point where boilerwork is done will be held responsible for the inspection and repair of all locomotive boilers and appurtenances under his jurisdiction. He must know that all defects disclosed by any inspection are properly repaired before the locomotive is returned to service. Such railway company shall appoint a practical boilermaker, as inspector, to carry out repairs, inspections and tests of locomotives, and all reports of such filed with the ministry shall bear his signature in conjunction with that of the mechanical officer in charge of the shop where such repairs, tests and examinations are made. The safe working pressure for each locomotive boiler shall be fixed by the chief inspector of the ministry after full consideration has been given to the design, workmanship, age and condition.</sectiontext>

In particular, Part III, relating to the design, registration and construction of unfired pressure vessels, shall govern the design, registration and construction of unfired pressure vessels used on locomotives; and Part V, relating to the design, registration and construction of railway locomotive boilers, shall govern the design, registration and construction of locomotive boilers and their appurtenances.</sectiontext>

Time "out of service" must be properly accounted for by "out of service" reports and notations of months claimed "out of service" made on the back of each subsequent inspection report and cab-card.
