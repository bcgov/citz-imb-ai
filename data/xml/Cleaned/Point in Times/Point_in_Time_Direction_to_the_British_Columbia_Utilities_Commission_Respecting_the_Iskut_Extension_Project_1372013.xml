      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:strong>BRITISH COLUMBIA HYDRO AND POWER AUTHORITY,</in:strong> with an office on the
        18th Floor, 333 Dunsmuir Street, Vancouver, BC V6B 5R3</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>("BC Hydro"); </bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>AND: </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>
        <in:strong>HIGHWAY 37 POWER CORP.,</in:strong> a corporation formed under the laws of
        British Columbia with an office at Suite 200 – 580 Hornby Street, Vancouver, BC V6C

        <in:strong>RED CHRIS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LTD.,</in:strong> a corporation formed under the

        3B6</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>("<in:strong>RCDC</in:strong>");</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>WHEREAS: </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A. RCDC holds certain agreements, rights and permits to develop the Red Chris
        Mine, and has submitted a service request, as amended, to BC Hydro for the Red Chris Mine
        (the "<in:strong>RCDC Service Request</in:strong>") in accordance with the Tariff to take
        electrical service at 55,000 kV.A at BC Hydro's Bob Quinn Substation
          ("<in:strong>BQN</in:strong>") which is currently under construction;</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>B. H37P holds certain agreements, rights and permits to develop a proposed 287kV
        transmission line (the "<in:strong>287kV Line</in:strong>") between BQN and a substation to
        be developed by BC Hydro in the vicinity of Tatogga Lake ("<in:strong>TAT</in:strong>") or
        if BC Hydro elects not to develop TAT then to the Mine Link in the vicinity of Tatogga Lake;
        and</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>C. RCDC, H37P and BC Hydro have determined that, as an alternative to RCDC
        taking electrical service for the Red Chris Mine at BQN, H37P should develop the 287kV Line,
        BC Hydro should acquire the 287kV Line from H37P, and RCDC should take electrical service
        for the Red Chris Mine at TAT, or on an interim basis via the Tap, as that is expected to
        permit RCDC to meet its expected Red Chris Mine ISD, would provide a better means of
        providing electrical service to the Red Chris Mine, and would facilitate the supply of
        electricity by BC Hydro to and the receipt of electricity by BC Hydro from other existing
        and future communities and developments in the region, all on the terms and conditions set
        out in this Agreement.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>IN CONSIDERATION of $1 paid by each of the Parties to the other and other good
        and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by
        each of the Parties) and the mutual promises contained in this Agreement the Parties agree

cost a commercial general liability policy in an amount not less than $10,000,000 per
occurrence. The policy shall also include a Forest and Prairie Protection Acts expense
endorsement, a standard "non owned automobile liability endorsement", products and
completed operations liability, broad form property damage, and shall provide coverage not
less than the insurance required by IBC Form 2100 or its equivalent replacement. The
policy shall remain in place for a period ending not earlier than twenty four (24) months
after the Closing Date. The policy shall name BC Hydro as additional insured and shall
contain a cross-liability and severability of interest clause and a waiver of subrogation
clause in favour of BC Hydro. H37P shall require the same insurance, including naming

      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:strong>2.6 <in:u>Consult on Contractors</in:u>.</in:strong> H37P will consult and
cooperate with BC Hydro with respect to the selection and retention of contractors in
respect of the 287kV Line, but nothing herein shall restrict or limit H37P's sole and
absolute discretion in selecting and retaining contractors.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:strong>2.7 <in:u>First Nations Consultation for the 287kV Line</in:u>.</in:strong>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) To the extent H37P is legally capable of doing so and in accordance with

respect of any Potential Impacts, and if required shall take measures to address,
prevent, mitigate or otherwise accommodate First Nations in respect of any Potential
Impacts as required by Applicable Laws ("<in:strong>H37P's Consultation and Accommodation
Obligations</in:strong>").</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) H37P shall not agree to accommodation arrangements that include any equity
participation in or revenue sharing in respect of the 287kV Line.</bcl:indent1>

Consultation and Accommodation Obligations, and in any event no later than twelve (12)
months before the 287kV Line ISD Deadline, H37P shall provide to BC Hydro full and
complete consultation records, details of any accommodation offered and accepted, and
such other information related to H37P's Consultation and Accommodation Obligations as
BC Hydro may reasonably request. BC Hydro shall, as soon as reasonably possible after
receipt of such records and other information, determine, acting reasonably, whether
H37P has met H37P's Consultation and Accommodation Obligations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) If BC Hydro determines, acting reasonably, that H37P has not met or is unable to
meet H37P's Consultation and Accommodation Obligations, then BC Hydro may assume H37P's
Consultation and Accommodation Obligations on behalf of H37P, and BC Hydro's actual
costs of doing so and costs related to adequately accommodating First Nations for
Potential Impacts, if any, shall be deducted from the Purchase Price.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:strong>2.8 <in:u>Warranty on 287kV Line</in:u>.</in:strong>
      </bcl:lefttext>

which appear within twenty four (24) months from the date BC Hydro gives or should have
given written acceptance of the remedial work performed by H37P.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) The warranties and representations in this Section 2.8 stand separate and apart
from any other warranties or representations given in this Agreement, and do not detract
from or amend said warranties or representations or BC Hydro's remedies
thereunder.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:strong>2.9 <in:u>Development of TAT</in:u>.</in:strong>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) BC Hydro may, at its option, engineer, design, construct, develop and commission
TAT.</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:indent2>(i) the 287kV Line is interconnected to TAT, and H37P was never required to
interconnect the 287kV Line with the Mine Link via the Tap; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(ii) 287kV Line is interconnected with the Mine Link via the Tap but TAT is
completed one (1) year or less after the Red Chris Mine ISD,</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>then RCDC shall pay $5.5 million to BC Hydro, on account of the Basic
Transmission Extension (as that term is defined in Tariff Supplement No. 6) that RCDC
would have been required to pay in accordance with Tariff Supplement No. 6, as
follows:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(iii) $&lt;*&gt; by &lt;*&gt;; and </bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(iv) $&lt;*&gt; by &lt;*&gt;. </bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) Any work required pursuant to Section 2.9(b) within the boundaries of TAT shall be
undertaken by BC Hydro and not by RCDC or H37P, as applicable, but at RCDC's or H37P's
cost, as applicable. BC Hydro may invoice RCDC or H37P or both for BC Hydro's actual
costs of doing such work, and RCDC and H37P shall pay all such invoices within thirty
(30) days of receipt.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(e) If RCDC disconnects the Mine Link from the 287kV Line via the Tap and
interconnects the Mine Link to TAT as required by Section 2.9(b) prior to the Closing
Time, then from that time until the Closing Time BC Hydro shall allow RCDC to wheel
electricity delivered at the Point of Delivery by BC Hydro pursuant to the Red Chris
Mine ESA from the 287kV Line to the Mine Link across such of TAT's facilities as
necessary at no cost to RCDC.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:strong>2.10 <in:u>Application of Tariff</in:u>.</in:strong> RCDC agrees that for
purposes of calculating rates payable by RCDC in connection with electrical service to
RCDC's Red Chris Mine, this Agreement constitutes and shall be deemed to be the
equivalent of the Facilities Agreement provided for in Tariff Supplement No. 6 for the
construction and installation of facilities to permit interconnection of the Red Chris
Mine with the NTL or with an extension thereto. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, RCDC acknowledges that accordingly, and in combination with the Red Chris
Mine ESA, RCDC is a customer to which BC Hydro's Tariff Supplement No. 37 as filed with
the British Columbia Utilities Commission on December 11, 2012 would
apply.</bcl:lefttext>

      <bcl:indent1>(c) BC Hydro will reasonably cooperate with H37P and RCDC so as to permit H37P and

            activities in satisfying the requirements of Sections 5.1 and 5.2. In completing such assessments
            BC Hydro shall advise H37P and RCDC of any material deficiencies BC Hydro identifies
            with such activities, provided no such interim assessment shall prevent BC Hydro, acting
            reasonably, from subsequently taking the position that the requirements of Sections
              5.1 and 5.2 have not been satisfied.</bcl:indent1>

          5.2(h) or both, or a failure to satisfy or waive the conditions in Sections 5.2(e) and
          5.2(f) if the failure to satisfy the condition in Section 5.2(f) is solely as a result of
          the BQN Upgrades not being complete, then BC Hydro shall reimburse H37P for interest
          incurred in financing a portion of the construction costs of the 287kV Line equal to the
          Purchase Price at an interest rate equal to the greater of the actual interest rate
          payable by H37P or 5% per annum from the time the balance of the conditions precedent in
          Section 5.2 are satisfied or waived until the BQN Upgrades are complete or the conditions
          in each of Sections
            5.2(e) and 5.2(f) are satisfied or waived, whichever is first to occur. For
          greater certainty, a delay in establishing a Closing Date that triggers an obligation for
          BC Hydro to reimburse H37P for interest incurred in financing the Purchase Price pursuant
          to this Section 6.2 will not result in a termination of this Agreement, and provided the
          applicable conditions are satisfied or waived as required to establish a Closing Date not

            Assets for which Consents are not received on or before Closing (collectively, the
            "Unassigned Interests"), the transfer and assignment of the Unassigned Interests will
            not be effective in each case until the applicable Consent has been received, and such
            Unassigned Interests will be held by H37P following the Closing in trust (to the extent
            permitted by Applicable Laws) for the benefit and exclusive use of BC Hydro. H37P shall
            continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable Consents
            and until such time as they are received, H37P shall only make use of any Unassigned
            Interests in accordance with the lawful directions of BC Hydro that do not conflict with
            the terms of such Unassigned Interests. BC Hydro will reimburse H37P for all

          H37P is unlikely to complete its obligations pursuant to Section 2.3 by the 287kV Line ISD
          Deadline, and H37P fails in BC Hydro's opinion to accelerate the likely completion date of
          its obligations pursuant to Section 2.3 to a date on or before the 287kV Line ISD
          Deadline within thirty (30) days of receiving a written demand notice from BC Hydro to

            fair market value consideration less the reasonable costs RCDC would have incurred had
            it had to develop a transmission line between BQN and the Mine Link sufficient to
            provide electrical service to the Red Chris Mine; and</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:lefttext>BC Hydro may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.2 if the
            only matter supporting BC Hydro's determination that H37P is unlikely to complete its

            fulfil, in all material respects, any of its covenants under this Agreement to be
            performed or fulfilled on or before the Closing Time, BC Hydro may terminate this

            any of its covenants under this Agreement to be performed or fulfilled on or before the
            Closing Time, H37P may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to BC Hydro and

            to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a
            right of termination will not be an election of remedies. Except as otherwise expressly
            provided in this SECTION 7, nothing in this SECTION 7 shall limit or affect any other
            rights or causes of action any Party may have with respect to the representations,
            warranties, covenants and indemnities in its favour contained in this
            Agreement.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) On termination of this Agreement, the agreement contained herein to modify the
            Point of Delivery and configuration of the RCDC Service Request to specify a Point of
            Delivery for the Red Chris Mine at TAT, or at the Tap if the Mine Link is connected to
            the 287kV Line via the Tap, terminates, and the Point of Delivery of the RCDC Service
            Request shall revert to BQN and remain subject to the Tariff without modification in any
            way by this Agreement. If a transmission line between BQN and TAT or another location in
            the vicinity of Tatogga Lake is subsequently developed or acquired by BC Hydro, any
            service request for the Red Chris Mine, whether or not specifying a Point of Delivery at
            any point on that line shall be subject to the Tariff and all applicable rates for
            electrical service pursuant thereto.</bcl:indent1>
