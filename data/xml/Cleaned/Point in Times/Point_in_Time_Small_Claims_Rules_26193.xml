      <bcl:text>The purpose of these rules is to make it as easy as possible for people to use the court to resolve their disputes. If necessary, there will be a trial and a judge or a justice of the peace will decide the claim. However, both sides are encouraged to try to come to an agreement. A settlement is always possible, even after a judge or a justice of the peace has made a decision.</bcl:text>
