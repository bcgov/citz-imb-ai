        <subsandwich>1. Complete this table for each of the NEOs for your company's three most recently completed financial years. Note the following:</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Columns (c) and (d) — include any cash or non-cash base salary and bonus earned by the NEO. For non-cash compensation, disclose the fair market value of the compensation at the time the compensation is earned. Amounts deferred at the election of a NEO must be included in the financial year in which earned. If the amount of salary and/or bonus earned in a given financial year is not calculable, that fact must be disclosed in a footnote and the amount must be disclosed in the subsequent financial year in the column for the financial year in which earned.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Any salary or bonus earned in a covered year that was foregone, at the election of a NEO, under a program of your company under which non-cash compensation may be received in lieu of a portion of annual compensation, need not be included in the salary or bonus columns. Instead, you may disclose the non-cash compensation in the appropriate column for that year (i.e. columns (f), (g) and (i)). If the election was made under a LTIP and therefore is not reportable at the time of grant in this table, a footnote must be added to the salary or bonus column disclosing this fact and referring to the table in section 3.1.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Commissions can be treated as salary or bonus. You can add a footnote to the table to indicate that such amounts are paid under a commission arrangement and disclose details of the arrangement in the compensation committee report (Item 9).</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Column (e) — disclose all other compensation of the NEO that is not properly categorized as salary or bonus, including</subsandwich>

          <paragraphnumber>a</paragraphnumber>
          <paragraphtext>Perquisites and other personal benefits, securities or property, unless the aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $50,000 and 10 per cent of the total of the annual salary and bonus of the NEO for the financial year. Generally, a perquisite is the cost or value of a personal benefit provided to the NEO that is not available to all employees. Examples of things that could be perquisites are</paragraphtext>
        </paragraph>
        <parasandwich>• Car allowance</parasandwich>

        <parasandwich>• CPP or Qu<eacute/>bec Pension Plan</parasandwich>

        <parasandwich>• Long-term benefits available to all employees</parasandwich>
        <parasandwich>• Medical</parasandwich>
        <parasandwich>Each perquisite or other personal benefit exceeding 25 per cent of the total perquisites and other personal benefits reported for a NEO must be identified by type and amount in a footnote to column (e). Perquisites and other personal benefits must be valued on the basis of the aggregate incremental cost to your company and its subsidiaries;</parasandwich>
        <paragraph>
          <paragraphnumber>b</paragraphnumber>
          <paragraphtext>The above-market portion of all interest, dividends or other amounts paid concerning securities, options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), loans, deferred compensation or other obligations issued to a NEO during the financial year or payable during that period but deferred at the election of the NEO. Above-market or preferential means a rate greater than the rate ordinarily paid by the company or its subsidiary on securities or other obligations having the same or similar features issued to third parties. Any above-market portion not reported in column (e) should be reported in column (i);</paragraphtext>

        <subsandwich>• Column (f) — includes the number of securities under option (with or without SARs awarded with the options) and, separately, the number of securities subject to freestanding SARs. The figures in this column for the most recent fiscal year should equal those reported in the table in section 4.1, column (b). These figures are not cumulative.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• If at any time during the most recently completed financial year your company repriced options or freestanding SARs previously awarded to a NEO, disclose the repriced options or SARs as new options or SARs grants in column (f).</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Column (g) — includes the dollar value (net of consideration paid by the NEO) of any shares or units that are subject to restrictions on resale (calculated by multiplying the closing market price of your company's freely trading shares on the date of grant by the number of stock or stock units awarded).</subsandwich>

        <parasandwich>• whether dividends or dividend equivalents will be paid on the shares and units that are subject to restrictions on resale disclosed in the column.</parasandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Column (h) — includes the dollar value of all payouts under LTIPs.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Awards of shares or units that are subject to restrictions on resale that are subject to performance-based conditions prior to vesting may be disclosed as LTIP awards under the table in section 3.1 instead of under column (g). If this approach is selected, once the share or unit vests, it must be reported as an LTIP payout in column (h).</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• If any specified performance target, goal or condition to payout was waived regarding any amount included in LTIP payouts, disclose this fact in a footnote to column (h).</subsandwich>

        <subsandwich>1. Complete this table for individual grants of options to purchase or acquire securities of your company or any of its subsidiaries (whether or not in conjunction with SARs) and freestanding SARs made during the most recently completed financial year to each of NEO. Note the following:</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• The information must be presented for each NEO in groups according to each issuer and class or series of security underlying the options or SARs granted and within these groups in reverse chronological order. For each grant, disclose in a footnote the issuer and the class or series of securities underlying the options or freestanding SARs granted.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• If more than one grant of options or freestanding SARs was made to a NEO during the most recently completed financial year, a separate row must be used to provide the particulars of each grant. However, multiple grants during a single financial year to a NEO can be aggregated if each grant was made on the same terms (eg. exercise price, expiration date and vesting thresholds, if any).</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• A single grant of options or freestanding SARs must be reported as separate grants for each tranche with a different exercise or base price, expiration date or performance-vesting threshold.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Each material term of the grant, including but not limited to the date of exercisability, the number of SARs, dividend equivalents, performance units or other instruments granted in conjunction with options, a performance-based condition to exercisability, a re-load feature or a tax-reimbursement feature must be disclosed in a footnote to the table.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• Options or freestanding SARs granted in an option repricing transaction must be disclosed.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• If the exercise or base price is adjustable over the term of an option or freestanding SAR in accordance with a prescribed standard or formula, include in a footnote to the table, a description of the standard or formula.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• If any provision of an option or SAR (other than an anti-dilution provision) could cause the exercise or base price to be lowered, a description of the provision and its potential consequences must be included in a footnote to the table.</subsandwich>
        <subsandwich>• In determining the grant date market value of the securities underlying options or freestanding SARs, use either the closing market price or any other formula prescribed under the option or SAR plan. For options or SARs granted prior to the establishment of a trading market in the underlying securities, the initial offering price may be used.</subsandwich>

The dollar value is calculated the same way as in column (c). Options or freestanding SARs are in-the-money at financial year-end if the market value of the underlying securities on that date exceeds the exercise or base price of the option or SAR.</subsandwich>

A board of directors may decide the value in securities of the company it intends to award or pay as compensation. Alternatively, a board of directors may decide the portion of the potential ownership of the company it intends to transfer as compensation. A fair value ascribed to the award will normally result from these approaches.</em>

        <em>3. While compensation practices vary, there are generally two approaches that boards of directors use when setting compensation. A board of directors may decide the value in securities of the company it intends to award or pay as compensation. Alternatively, a board of directors may decide the portion of the potential ownership of the company it intends to transfer as compensation. A fair value ascribed to the award will normally result from these approaches.</em>

        <em>4. In some cases, the grant date fair value disclosed in columns (d) and (e) may differ from the accounting fair value.

        <em>5. While the most commonly used methodologies for calculating the value of most types of awards are the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the binomial lattice model, companies may choose to use another valuation methodology if it produces a more meaningful and reasonable estimate of fair value.</em>
