              <strong>Significant Acquisitions</strong>
                        — Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "significant acquisition" refers to an acquisition of a business, an acquisition of related businesses, a probable acquisition of a business or a probable acquisition of related businesses that satisfies any of the significance tests.</subsectiontext>

              <strong>Required Significance Tests at Date of Acquisition</strong>
                        — For the purposes of this Instrument, an acquisition of a business, an acquisition of related businesses, a probable acquisition of a business or a probable acquisition of related businesses is a significant acquisition, if it satisfies any of the following three tests:</subsectiontext>
          </subsection>
          <parasandwich>1. <strong>The Asset Test.</strong> The issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated assets of the business or related businesses exceeds 20 per cent of the consolidated assets of the issuer calculated using the audited financial statements of each of the issuer and the business or the related businesses for the most recently completed financial year of the issuer ended before the date of the acquisition.</parasandwich>
          <parasandwich>2. <strong>The Investment Test.</strong> The issuer's consolidated investments in and advances to the business or the related businesses exceeds 20 per cent of the consolidated assets of the issuer as at the last day of the most recently completed financial year of the issuer ended before the date of the acquisition for which audited financial statements are included in the short form prospectus, excluding any investments in or advances to the business or the related businesses as at that date.</parasandwich>
          <parasandwich>3. <strong>The Income Test.</strong> The issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated income from continuing operations of the business or related businesses exceeds 20 per cent of the consolidated income from continuing operations of the issuer calculated using the audited financial statements of each of the issuer and the business or related businesses for the most recently completed financial year of each ended before the date of the acquisition.</parasandwich>

            <subsectiontext>
              <strong>Optional Significance Tests Subsequent to the Date of Acquisition</strong>
                        — If an acquisition of a business, an acquisition of related businesses, a probable acquisition of a business or a probable acquisition of related businesses is significant based on the significance tests in subsection (2), the issuer may re-calculate the significance at a more recent date as follows:</subsectiontext>
          </subsection>
          <parasandwich>1. <strong>The Asset Test.</strong> The issuer's proportionate share of the total consolidated assets of the business or the related businesses, as at the date of the issuer's most recent balance sheet included in the short form prospectus, exceeds 20 per cent of the consolidated assets of the issuer, as at the date of the issuer's most recent balance sheet included in the short form prospectus, without giving effect to the acquisition.</parasandwich>
          <parasandwich>2. <strong>The Investment Test.</strong> The issuer's consolidated investments in and advances to the business or the related businesses as at the date of the acquisition or the proposed date of the acquisition exceeds 20 per cent of the consolidated assets of the issuer as at the date of the issuer's most recent balance sheet included in the short form prospectus for a period that ends before the date of the acquisition, excluding any investments in or advances to the business or related business as at that date.</parasandwich>
          <parasandwich>3. <strong>The Income Test.</strong> The income from continuing operations calculated pursuant to the following clause (a) exceeds 20 per cent of the income from continuing operations calculated pursuant to the following clause (b):</parasandwich>

            <subsectiontext>Despite subsection (3), the significance of an acquisition of a business, an acquisition of related businesses, a probable acquisition of a business or a probable acquisition of related businesses may be re-calculated only if, subsequent to the acquisition date, the business or related businesses remained substantially intact, were not significantly reorganized, and no significant assets and liabilities were transferred to other entities.</subsectiontext>

              <em>(1) The objective of the short form prospectus is to provide information concerning the issuer that an investor needs in order to make an informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific disclosure requirements that are in addition to the general requirement under securities legislation to provide full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities to be distributed. Certain rules of specific application impose prospectus disclosure obligations in addition to those described in this Form.</em>
            </subsandwich>
            <subsandwich>
              <em>(2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or interpreted in National Instrument 44-101 Short Form Prospectus Distributions shall bear that definition or interpretation. Other definitions are set out in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions.</em>
            </subsandwich>
            <subsandwich>
              <em>(3) In determining the degree of detail required a standard of materiality should be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgement in the particular circumstance, and should generally be determined in relation to an item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is considered material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. The potential significance of items should be considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an offsetting effect. This concept of materiality is consistent with the financial reporting notion of materiality contained in the Handbook.</em>

            <subsandwich>
              <em>(4) Unless an item specifically requires disclosure only in the preliminary short form prospectus, the disclosure requirements set out in this Form apply to both the preliminary short form prospectus and the short form prospectus. Details concerning the price and other matters dependent upon or relating to price, such as the number of securities being distributed, may be left out of the preliminary short form prospectus, along with specifics concerning the plan of distribution, to the extent that these matters have not been decided.</em>

            <subsandwich>
              <em>(5) Any information required in a short form prospectus may be incorporated by reference in the short form prospectus, other than confidential material change reports. Clearly identify in a short form prospectus any document incorporated by reference. If an excerpt of a document is incorporated by reference, clearly identify the excerpt in the short form prospectus by caption and paragraph of the document. Any material incorporated by reference in a short form prospectus is required under sections 10.2 and 10.3 of National Instrument 44-101 to be filed with the short form prospectus unless it has been previously filed.</em>

            <subsandwich>
              <em>(6) The disclosure must be understandable to readers and presented in any easy to read format. The presentation of information should comply with the plain language principles listed in section 9.2 of Companion Policy 44-101CP Short Form Prospectus Distributions. If technical terms are required, clear and concise explanations should be included.</em>
            </subsandwich>
            <subsandwich>
              <em>(7) No reference need be made to inapplicable items and, unless otherwise required in this Form, negative answers to items may be omitted.</em>

            <subsandwich>
              <em>(8) Where the term "issuer" is used, it may be necessary, in order to meet the requirement for full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts, to also include disclosure with respect to the issuer's subsidiaries and investees. If it is more likely than not that a person or company will become a subsidiary or investee, it may be necessary to also include disclosure with respect to the person or company.</em>
            </subsandwich>
            <subsandwich>
              <em>(9) An issuer that is a special purpose vehicle may have to modify the disclosure items to reflect the special purpose nature of its business.</em>
            </subsandwich>
            <subsandwich>
              <em>(10) If disclosure is required as of a specific date and there has been a material change or change that is otherwise significant in the required information subsequent to that date, present the information as of the date of the change or a date subsequent to the change instead.</em>
