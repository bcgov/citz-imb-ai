        <em>(3) In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgement in the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is considered material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an offsetting effect. This concept of materiality is consistent with the financial reporting notion of materiality contained in the Handbook.</em>

If it is more likely than not that a person or company will become an entity that the issuer will be required, under the issuer's GAAP, to consolidate, proportionately consolidate or account for using the equity method, it may be necessary to also include disclosure with respect to the person or company.</em>
