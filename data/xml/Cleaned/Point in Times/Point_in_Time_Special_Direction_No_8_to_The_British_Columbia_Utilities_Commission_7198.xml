          <sectiontext>In designing B.C. Hydro electricity rates, the Commission shall ensure that those rates contribute to conservation and efficient electricity use by reflecting the total cost of new sources of electricity supply, and those costs shall be evaluated using a cost of capital consistent with that earned on a pre-income tax basis by the most comparable investor-owned energy utility regulated under the Act.</sectiontext>

          <sectiontext>In determining whether the rates of B.C. Hydro are sufficient to yield a fair and reasonable compensation for the services provided by it, or a fair and reasonable return on the appraised value of its property, the Commission must ensure the rates permit B.C.
