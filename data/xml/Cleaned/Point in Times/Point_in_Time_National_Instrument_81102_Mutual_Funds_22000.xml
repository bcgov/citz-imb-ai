      <lefttext>We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards for assurance engagements established by The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance as a basis for our opinion. Such an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the assertions in management's compliance report.</lefttext>
      <lefttext>In our opinion, the Company's report presents fairly, in all material respects, the Company's compliance for the year ended [insert date] with the applicable requirements of Parts 9, 10 and 11 of National Instrument 81-102 in respect of the Funds.</lefttext>
