Where the Parties fail to agree on a mediator within 15 days after commencement of a mediation, the appointment will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority on the written request of a Party that is copied to the other Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>5. Subject to any limitations agreed to by the Parties, a mediator may employ reasonable and necessary administrative or other support services.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REQUIREMENT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>6. At any time a Party may give the mediator and the other Parties a written notice requiring the mediator to withdraw from the mediation on the grounds that the Party has justifiable doubts as to the mediator's independence or impartiality.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>7. On receipt of a written notice under Section 6, the mediator will immediately withdraw from the mediation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>8. An individual who is a Tla'amin Citizen, or related to a Tla'amin Citizen, will not be required to withdraw under Section 6 solely on the grounds of that citizenship or relationship.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>END OF APPOINTMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>9. A mediator's appointment terminates where:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the mediator is required to withdraw under Section 7;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the mediator withdraws from office for any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the Parties agree to the termination.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>10.

A Party may attend a mediation with or without legal counsel.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>12. Where a mediator is a lawyer, the mediator will not act as legal counsel for any Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>13. At the commencement of the first meeting of a mediation, each Party will advise the mediator and the other Parties of any limitations on the authority of its representatives.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONDUCT OF MEDIATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>14. The Parties will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. make a serious attempt to resolve the Disagreement by:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. identifying underlying interests;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. isolating points of agreement and Disagreement;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii. exploring alternative solutions; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iv. considering compromises or accommodations; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b. cooperate fully with the mediator and give prompt attention and respond to all communications from the mediator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>15. A mediator may conduct a mediation in any manner the mediator considers necessary and appropriate to assist the Parties to resolve the Disagreement in a fair, efficient and cost-effective manner.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>16. Within seven days of the appointment of a mediator, each Party will deliver a brief written summary to the mediator of the relevant facts, the issues in the Disagreement, and its viewpoint in respect of them and the mediator will deliver copies of the summaries to each Party at the end of the seven day period.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>17. A mediator may conduct a mediation in joint meetings or private caucus convened at locations the mediator designates after consulting the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>18. Disclosures made by any Party to a mediator in private caucus will not be disclosed by the mediator to any other Party without the consent of the disclosing Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>19. No transcript or recording will be kept of a mediation meeting, but this does not prevent an individual from keeping notes of the negotiations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>20. In order to assist in the resolution of a Disagreement, a mediation will not be open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>21.

A mediator, or anyone retained or employed by the mediator, is not compellable in any proceeding to give evidence about any oral or written information acquired or opinion formed by that individual as a result of the mediation, and all Parties will oppose any effort to have that individual or that information subpoenaed.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>25. A mediator, or anyone retained or employed by the mediator, is disqualified as a consultant or expert in any proceeding relating to the Disagreement, including any proceeding that involves Persons not a Party to the mediation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REFERRAL OF ISSUES TO OTHER PROCESSES</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>26. During a mediation, the Parties may agree to refer particular issues in the Disagreement to independent fact-finders, expert panels or other processes for opinions or findings that may assist them in the resolution of the Disagreement, and in that event, the Parties will specify:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the terms of reference for the process;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the time within which the process will be concluded; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. how the costs of the process are to be allocated to the Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>27.

A Party may withdraw from a mediation at any time by giving written notice of its intent to the mediator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>29. Before a withdrawal is effective, the withdrawing Party will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. speak with the mediator;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. disclose its reasons for withdrawing; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. give the mediator the opportunity to discuss the consequences of withdrawal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF MEDIATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>30. A mediation is terminated when any of the following occurs:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. subject to Section 27, the expiration of 30 days after the appointment of the mediator or any longer period agreed by the Parties in writing;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the Parties have agreed in writing to terminate the mediation or not to appoint a replacement mediator under Section 10;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. a Party directly engaged in the Disagreement withdraws from the mediation under Section 28; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement sign a written agreement resolving the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>MEDIATOR RECOMMENDATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>31.

A question of law may not be referred to a Panel.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>2. A Reference commences on the date the Parties directly engaged in a Disagreement have agreed in writing to use a Panel under subparagraph 23. b of the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPOINTMENT OF PANEL MEMBERS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>3. A Panel will have three Members unless the Parties agree on a Panel of five Members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>4. A Member will be skilled and knowledgeable in the technical, scientific or traditional knowledge subject matter or issues of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>5. Where there are two Parties and the Panel will have:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. three Members, each Party will appoint one Member and the two appointed Members will jointly appoint the third Member; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. five Members, each Party will appoint two Members and the four appointed Members will jointly appoint the fifth Member.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>6.

A Panel will appoint one of its Members to act as chair of the Panel.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>27. The chair of a Panel is responsible for all communications between the Panel, the Parties and any other Person with whom the Panel wishes to communicate, but this does not preclude a Member from communicating informally with a Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>28. A Panel will make every reasonable effort to conduct its business, and fulfill its obligations under its terms of reference, by consensus, but:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. where consensus is not possible, by actions approved by a majority of its Members; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. where a majority is not possible, by actions approved by the chair of the Panel.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>RIGHT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>29. Where one of two Parties to a Reference, or two of three Parties to a Reference, are not satisfied with the progress of the Reference:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. after receipt of an interim report; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. as a result of the Panel's failure to submit an interim report within the required time,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the dissatisfied Party or Parties, as the case may be, may give written notice to the Panel and the other Party that the Party or Parties are withdrawing from the Reference and that the Reference is terminated.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>30. If one of three Parties to a Reference is not satisfied with the progress of the Reference:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. after receipt of an interim report; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. as a result of the Panel's failure to submit an interim report within the required time,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the dissatisfied Party may give written notice to the Panel and the other Parties that it is withdrawing from the Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>31. Two Parties who receive a notice under Section 30 will advise the Panel in writing that they have agreed:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. to terminate the Reference; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. to continue the Reference.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>32. Where no Party gives a notice under Sections 29 or 30 within 10 days after:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. receipt of an interim report; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the time required to submit an interim report,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>all Parties will be deemed to be satisfied with the progress of the Reference until submission of the next required interim report.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>33. No Party may withdraw from a Reference except as permitted under Sections 29 to 32.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>34. The Parties may, by agreement recorded in the terms of reference, limit the application of all or any part of Sections 35 to 40 in a Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>35. In order to assist in the resolution of the Disagreement, a Reference will not be open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>36. The Parties, and all Persons, will keep confidential:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. all oral and written information disclosed in the Reference; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the fact that this information has been disclosed.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>37. The Parties will not rely on or introduce as evidence in any proceeding, whether or not that proceeding relates to the subject matter of the Reference, any oral or written information disclosed in or arising from the Reference, including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. any documents of other Parties produced in the course of the Reference that are not otherwise produced or producible in that proceeding;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. any views expressed, or suggestions made, in respect of a possible settlement of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. any admissions made by any Party in the course of the Reference, unless otherwise agreed by the admitting Party;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the fact that any Party has indicated a willingness to make or accept a proposal or recommendation for settlement; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. any reports of the Panel.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>38. Sections 36 and 37 do not apply:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. in any proceeding for the enforcement or setting aside of an agreement resolving the Disagreement that was the subject of a Reference;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. where the adjudicator in any proceeding determines that the interests of the public or the administration of justice outweigh the need for confidentiality; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. where the oral or written information referred to in those Sections is in the public forum.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>39. A Member, or anyone retained or employed by the Member, is not compellable in any proceeding to give evidence about any oral or written information acquired or opinion formed by that individual as a result of the Reference and all Parties will oppose any effort to have that individual or that information subpoenaed.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>40. A Member, or anyone retained or employed by the Member, is disqualified as a consultant or expert in any proceeding relating to the Disagreement, including any proceeding that involves Persons not a Party to the Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE AFTER REPORT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>41. Within 21 days after receipt of the final written report of a Panel, the Parties will meet and make an effort to resolve the Disagreement taking into account the report of the Panel or any other considerations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>42. Where the Parties and the Panel agree, the Members may attend the meeting under Section 41 and provide any necessary assistance to the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF REFERENCE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>43.

A neutral evaluation commences on the date that the Parties directly engaged in a Disagreement have agreed in writing to use neutral evaluation under subparagraph 23. c of the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPOINTMENT OF NEUTRAL EVALUATOR</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>2. A neutral evaluation will be conducted by one individual jointly appointed by the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>3. A neutral evaluator will be:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. experienced or skilled in the subject matter or issues of the Disagreement; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. independent and impartial.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>4. Where the Parties fail to agree on a neutral evaluator within 21 days after commencement of a neutral evaluation, the appointment will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority on the written request of a Party that is copied to the other Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>5. Subject to any limitations agreed to by the Parties, a neutral evaluator may employ reasonable and necessary administrative or other support services.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>REQUIREMENT TO WITHDRAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>6. At any time a Party may give a neutral evaluator and the other Parties a written notice requiring the neutral evaluator to withdraw from the neutral evaluation on the grounds that the Party has justifiable doubts as to the neutral evaluator's independence or impartiality.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>7. On receipt of a written notice under Section 6, the neutral evaluator will immediately withdraw from the neutral evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>8. An individual who is a Tla'amin Citizen, or related to a Tla'amin Citizen, will not be required to withdraw under Section 7 solely on the grounds of that citizenship or relationship.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>END OF APPOINTMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>9. A neutral evaluator's appointment terminates where:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the neutral evaluator is required to withdraw under Section 7;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the neutral evaluator withdraws for any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the Parties agree to the termination.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>10. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, where a neutral evaluator's appointment terminates, a replacement will be appointed under Section 4 within the required time commencing from the date of the termination of the appointment.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMMUNICATIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>11. Except in respect of administrative details or a meeting under Section 33, the Parties will not communicate with the neutral evaluator:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. orally except in the presence of all Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. in writing without immediately sending a copy of that communication to all Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>12. Section 11 also applies to any communication by a neutral evaluator to the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONDUCT OF NEUTRAL EVALUATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>13. The Parties will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. cooperate fully with the neutral evaluator;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. comply with any requests made by the neutral evaluator as permitted or required under this Appendix; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. give prompt attention and respond to all communications from the neutral evaluator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>14. A neutral evaluation will be conducted only on the basis of documents submitted by the Parties under Section 19 unless the Parties agree to, or the neutral evaluator requires, additional submissions or other forms of evidence.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>15. Where a hearing is held, the hearing will be conducted as efficiently as possible and in the manner the neutral evaluator specifies, after consultation with the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>16. Where a hearing is held, the Panel will give the Parties reasonable written notice of the hearing date, which notice will, in any event, be not less than seven days.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>17. No transcript or recording will be kept of a hearing, but this does not prevent an individual attending the hearing from keeping notes of the hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>18. The legal rules of evidence do not apply to a neutral evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>19. Within 15 days after the appointment of a neutral evaluator, each Party will deliver to the other Parties and to the neutral evaluator a written submission respecting the Disagreement, including facts upon which the Parties agree or disagree, and copies of any documents, affidavits and exhibits on which the Party relies.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>20. Within 21 days after the appointment of a neutral evaluator, a Party may submit a reply to the submission of any other Party and, in that event, will provide copies of the reply to the Party and the neutral evaluator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>21. Where the matter referred to the neutral evaluator is an objection to a proposed expropriation of an interest in Tla'amin Lands under section 4 of Appendix J-2, the following abridgement of time limits applies to the neutral evaluation process set out in this Appendix, unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. under Section 4, the Parties must agree to a neutral evaluator within 7 days after the commencement of a neutral evaluation; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. under Section 15, if a hearing is held it must be held within 35 days after the commencement of a neutral evaluation.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>22. Where the matter referred to the neutral evaluator is an objection to a proposed expropriation of an interest in Tla'amin Lands under section 4 of Appendix J-2, sections 33, 34, 35. b and 36. a of this Appendix do not apply to the neutral evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>23. For greater certainty, a neutral evaluation concerning an objection to a proposed expropriation of an interest in Tla'amin Lands under section 4 of Appendix J-2 commences for the purposes of Section 1 of this Appendix on the day that notice in writing is received by the Federal Expropriating Authority.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>24. In order to assist in the resolution of the Disagreement, a neutral evaluation will not be open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>25. The Parties, and all Persons, will keep confidential:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. all oral and written information disclosed in the neutral evaluation; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the fact that this information has been disclosed.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>26. The Parties will not rely on or introduce as evidence in any proceeding, whether or not that proceeding relates to the subject matter of the neutral evaluation, any oral or written information disclosed in or arising from the neutral evaluation, including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. any documents of other Parties produced in the course of the neutral evaluation which are not otherwise produced or producible in that proceeding;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. any views expressed, or suggestions made, in respect of a possible settlement of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. any admissions made by any Party in the course of the neutral evaluation, unless otherwise agreed by the admitting Party;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the fact that any Party has indicated a willingness to make or accept a proposal for settlement; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. subject to Section 30, the opinion of the neutral evaluator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>27. Sections 25 and 26 do not apply:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. in any proceedings for the enforcement or setting aside of an agreement resolving the Disagreement that was the subject of a neutral evaluation;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. where the adjudicator in any proceeding determines that the interests of the public or the administration of justice outweigh the need for confidentiality; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. where the oral or written information is in the public forum.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>28. A neutral evaluator, or anyone retained or employed by the neutral evaluator, is not compellable in any proceedings to give evidence about any oral or written information acquired or opinion formed by that individual as a result of a neutral evaluation under this Appendix and all Parties will oppose any effort to have that individual or that information subpoenaed.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>29. A neutral evaluator and anyone retained or employed by the neutral evaluator is disqualified as a consultant or expert in any proceeding relating to the Disagreement, including any proceeding that involves Persons not a Party to the neutral evaluation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>30. Notwithstanding Sections 25 to 28, after an Arbitral Tribunal has delivered its final Arbitral Award, or a court has referred its decision, in respect of a Disagreement, a Party, for the purpose only of making a submission on the allocation of costs of that arbitral or judicial proceeding, may give to the Arbitral Tribunal or the court a copy of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the neutral evaluator's opinion respecting that Disagreement; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the neutral evaluator's notice of termination under Section 6.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>NON-BINDING OPINION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>31. Within 21 days after the later of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the delivery of the last submission required or permitted in a neutral evaluation under this Appendix; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the completion of a hearing,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the neutral evaluator will deliver to the Parties a written opinion with reasons in respect of the probable disposition of the Disagreement should it be submitted to arbitral or judicial proceedings, as the case may be, under the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>32. An opinion under Section 31 is not binding on the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE AFTER OPINION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>33. Within 21 days after delivery of an opinion under Section 31, the Parties will meet and make an effort to resolve the Disagreement, taking into account the opinion of the neutral evaluator or any other considerations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>34. Where the Parties and the neutral evaluator agree, the neutral evaluator may attend a meeting under Section 33 and provide any necessary assistance to the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>FAILURE TO COMPLY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>35. Where a Party fails to participate in the neutral evaluation as contemplated in Sections 13 to 23, the neutral evaluator may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. provide an opinion based solely upon the information and submissions they have obtained; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. give a written notice of termination of the neutral evaluation,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>to the Parties and, in either event, the neutral evaluator will record that Party's failure.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF NEUTRAL EVALUATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>36. A neutral evaluation is terminated when any of the following occurs:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the neutral evaluator gives a notice of termination under Subsection 35. b;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the expiration of 30 days after receipt of an opinion under Section 31 or 35, as the case may be, or any longer period agreed by the Parties;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. all the Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement agree in writing to terminate the neutral evaluation; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. all the Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement sign a written agreement resolving the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COSTS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>37. A Party that has failed to participate in a neutral evaluation as contemplated in Sections 13 to 23 is responsible for its share of the costs of the neutral evaluation, despite its failure to participate.</bcl:indent1><bcl:centertext><in:strong><in:a name="appX-5"/>Appendix X-5</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:centertext><in:strong>Community Advisory Council</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFINITIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:lefttext>In this Appendix:</bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Chapter"</in:strong> means the Dispute Resolution Chapter of this Agreement;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Council"</in:strong> means a community advisory council appointed under this Appendix;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Member"</in:strong> means a member of a Council;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Party"</in:strong> means a participating party to a Reference under this Appendix;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Reference"</in:strong> means a reference of a Disagreement to a Council;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Section"</in:strong> means a section in this Appendix; and</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Subsection"</in:strong> means a subsection in this Appendix.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GENERAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>1.

Within 30 days after a Reference has commenced, each Party will appoint at least one, but not more than three, Members to a Council.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>3. Preferably, the Members will be individuals who are:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. recognized in their respective communities as wise, tolerant, personable and articulate, and who:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. are often sought out for counsel or advice; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. have a record of distinguished public service; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b. available to devote the time and energy as required to provide the assistance described in this Appendix.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>END OF APPOINTMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>4.

In a Reference the Parties will cooperate fully with the Council and give prompt attention and respond to all communications from the Council.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>8. Notwithstanding Section 7, a Party is not required to disclose to the Council or provide it with any information that the Party would not be required to disclose in any arbitral or judicial proceedings in respect of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>9. A Council is expected to conduct itself informally in order that the Parties may take full advantage of the Council's good offices to resolve a Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>10. A Council may establish its own process to suit the particular circumstances of a Reference including meeting with the Parties together or separately, conducting informal interviews or inquiries and facilitating settlement negotiations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>11. A Council will give the Parties its final advice or recommendations on a Disagreement referred to it within 120 days after the commencement of the Reference.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>12.

A Council may, by unanimous decision, extend the time for giving advice or recommendations under Section 11, on one occasion only, to a maximum of 60 additional days.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>14.

A Reference is terminated when any of the following occurs:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the Council gives the Parties its advice under Section 11;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the expiration of the applicable time period in Section 11 or 13; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement sign a written agreement resolving the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:centertext><in:strong><in:a name="appX-6"/>Appendix X-6</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:centertext><in:strong>Arbitration</in:strong></bcl:centertext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFINITIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:lefttext>In this Appendix:</bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Applicant"</in:strong> means:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. in an arbitration commenced under paragraph 27 of the Chapter, the Party that delivered the notice of arbitration; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. in an arbitration commenced under paragraph 28 of the Chapter, the Party that the Parties have agreed will be the applicant in the agreement to arbitrate;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Arbitral Award"</in:strong> means any decision of the Arbitral Tribunal on the substance of the Disagreement submitted to it, and includes:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. an interim Arbitral Award, including an interim award made for the preservation of property; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. an award of interest or costs;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Arbitral Tribunal"</in:strong> means a single arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators appointed under this Appendix;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Arbitration Agreement"</in:strong> includes:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the requirement to refer to arbitration Disagreements described in paragraph 27 of the Chapter; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. an agreement to arbitrate a Disagreement as described in paragraph 28 of the Chapter;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Chapter"</in:strong> means the Dispute Resolution Chapter of this Agreement;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Party"</in:strong> means a participating party to arbitration under this Appendix;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Respondent"</in:strong> means a Party other than the Applicant;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Section"</in:strong> means a section in this Appendix;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Subsection"</in:strong> means a subsection in this Appendix; and</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1><in:strong>"Supreme Court"</in:strong> means the Supreme Court of British Columbia.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GENERAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>1. A reference in this Appendix to a claim, other than in Section 87 or Subsection 116. a, applies to a counterclaim, and a reference in this Appendix to a defence applies to a defence to a counterclaim.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>2. Notwithstanding paragraph 4 of the Chapter, the Parties may not vary Section 52 or 97.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMMUNICATIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>3. Except in respect of administrative details, the Parties will not communicate with an Arbitral Tribunal:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. orally, except in the presence of all other Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. in writing, without immediately sending a copy of that communication to all other Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>4. Section 3 also applies to any communication by an Arbitral Tribunal to the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO OBJECT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>5. A Party will be deemed to have waived its right to object where it knows that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. any provision of this Appendix; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. any requirement under this Agreement or an Arbitration Agreement,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>has not been complied with, and yet it proceeds with the arbitration without stating its objection to noncompliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for stating that objection, within that period of time.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>EXTENT OF JUDICIAL INTERVENTION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>6. In matters governed by this Appendix:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. no court will intervene except as provided in this Appendix; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. no arbitral proceedings of an Arbitral Tribunal or an order, ruling or Arbitral Award made by an Arbitral Tribunal will be questioned, reviewed or restrained by a proceeding under any legislation or other law that permits judicial review except to the extent provided in this Appendix.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CONSTRUCTION OF APPENDIX</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>7. In construing a provision of this Appendix, a court or Arbitral Tribunal may refer to the documents of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and its working group respecting the preparation of the UNCITRAL Model Arbitration Law and will give those documents the weight that is appropriate in the circumstances.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>STAY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>8. Where a Party commences legal proceedings in a court against another Party in respect of a matter required or agreed to be submitted to arbitration, a Party to the legal proceedings may apply to that court to stay the proceedings before or after entering an appearance, and before delivery of any pleadings or taking any other step in the proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>9. In an application under Section 8, the court will make an order staying the legal proceedings unless it determines that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the Arbitration Agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the legal proceedings are permitted under the Chapter.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>10. An arbitration may be commenced or continued, and an Arbitral Award made, even if an application has been brought under Section 8, and the issue is pending before the court.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>INTERIM MEASURES BY COURT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>11. It is not incompatible with an Arbitration Agreement for a Party to request from a court, before or during arbitral proceedings, an interim measure of protection as provided in paragraph 13 of the Chapter and for a court to grant that measure.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMMENCEMENT OF ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>12. The arbitral proceedings in respect of a Disagreement:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. required to be arbitrated as set out in paragraph 27 of the Chapter, commences on delivery of the notice of arbitration to the Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. agreed to be arbitrated as set out in paragraph 28 of the Chapter, commences on the date of the Arbitration Agreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>NOTICE OF ARBITRATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>13. A notice of arbitration under paragraph 27 of the Chapter will be in writing and contain the following information:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. a statement of the subject matter or issues of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. a requirement that the Disagreement be referred to arbitration;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the remedy sought;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the suggested number of arbitrators; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. any preferred qualifications of the arbitrators.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>14. A notice of arbitration under Section 13 may also contain the names of any proposed arbitrators.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>ARBITRATORS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>15. In an arbitration:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. required to be arbitrated as set out in paragraph 27 of the Chapter, there will be three arbitrators; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. agreed to be arbitrated as set out in paragraph 28 of the Chapter, there will be one arbitrator.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>16. An individual eligible for appointment as:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. a single arbitrator or as chair of an Arbitral Tribunal will be an experienced arbitrator or arbitration counsel or have had training in arbitral procedure; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. a member of an Arbitral Tribunal, including a single arbitrator and a chair of an Arbitral Tribunal:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. will be independent and impartial; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. preferably, will have knowledge of, or experience in, the subject matter or issues of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent3><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPOINTMENT OF ARBITRATORS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>17. A Party proposing the name of an arbitrator will also submit a copy of that individual's resume and the statement that individual is required to make under Section 25.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>18. In an arbitration with a single arbitrator, where the Parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within 30 days after the commencement of the arbitration, the appointment will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority on the written request of a Party that is copied to the other Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>19. In an arbitration with three arbitrators and two Parties, each Party will appoint one arbitrator and the two appointed arbitrators will appoint the third arbitrator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>20. In the appointment procedure under Section 19, where:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. a Party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days after receipt of a request to do so from the other Party; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within 30 days after the last of them was appointed,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the appointment will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority on the written request of a Party that is copied to the other Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>21. In an arbitration with three arbitrators and three Parties, the three Parties will jointly appoint the three arbitrators.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>22. In the arbitration procedure under Section 21, where the three Parties fail to agree on the three arbitrators within 60 days after the commencement of the arbitration, the appointments will be made by the Neutral Appointing Authority on the written request of a Party copied to the other Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>23. In an arbitration procedure under Sections 19 or 21, the three arbitrators will select a chair of the Arbitral Tribunal. In the event that the three arbitrators are unable to agree on the selection of a chair before the pre-hearing meeting, they will so advise the Neutral Appointing Authority in writing and the Neutral Appointing Authority will select a chair.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>24. The Neutral Appointing Authority in appointing an arbitrator or the chair of an Arbitral Tribunal will have due regard to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. any qualifications required of the arbitrator as set out in Section 16 or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator or chair.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>25. When an individual is approached in connection with possible appointment as an arbitrator, that individual will provide a written statement:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. disclosing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to their independence or impartiality; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. advising that the individual is not aware of any circumstances of that nature and committing to disclose them if they arise or become known at a later date.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>26. An arbitrator, from the time of appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, will, without delay, disclose to the Parties any circumstances referred to in Section 25 unless the Parties have already been informed of them.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>27. An arbitrator may be challenged only where:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's independence or impartiality; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the arbitrator does not possess the qualifications set out in this Appendix or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>28. A Party may only challenge an arbitrator appointed by that Party, or in whose appointment that Party has participated, for reasons which that Party becomes aware of after the appointment has been made.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>29. An individual who is a Tla'amin Citizen, or related to a Tla'amin Citizen, may not be challenged under Section 27 solely on the grounds of that citizenship or relationship.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CHALLENGE PROCEDURE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>30. A Party who intends to challenge an arbitrator will send to the Arbitral Tribunal a written statement of the reasons for the challenge within 15 days after becoming aware of the establishment of the Arbitral Tribunal, or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in Section 27.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>31. Unless the arbitrator challenged under Section 30 withdraws from office, or the other Parties agree to the challenge, the Arbitral Tribunal will decide on the challenge.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>32. Where a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the Parties or under the procedure under Section 30 is not successful, the challenging Party, within 30 days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the challenge, may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to decide on the challenge.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>33. The decision of the Neutral Appointing Authority under Section 32 is final and is not subject to appeal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>34. While a request under Section 32 is pending, the Arbitral Tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an Arbitral Award unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the Neutral Appointing Authority is made would unduly prejudice the Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the Parties agree otherwise.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>FAILURE OR IMPOSSIBILITY TO ACT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>35. The mandate of an arbitrator terminates where the arbitrator becomes unable at law, or as a practical matter, to perform the arbitrator's functions, or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>36. Where a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in Section 35, a Party may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to decide on the termination of the mandate.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF MANDATE AND SUBSTITUTION OF ARBITRATOR</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>37. In addition to the circumstances referred to under Sections 30 to 32 and 35, the mandate of an arbitrator terminates:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. where the arbitrator withdraws from office for any reason; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. by agreement of the Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>38. Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a replacement arbitrator will be appointed under Sections 17 to 24, as applicable.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>39. Where a single arbitrator or a chair of an Arbitral Tribunal is replaced, any hearings previously held will be repeated.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>40. Where an arbitrator, other than a single arbitrator or a chair of an Arbitral Tribunal, is replaced, any hearings previously held may be repeated at the discretion of the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>41. An order or ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal made before the replacement of an arbitrator under Section 38 is not invalid solely because there has been a change in the composition of the tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>COMPETENCE OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO RULE ON ITS JURISDICTION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>42. An Arbitral Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>43. A plea that an Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction will be raised no later than the submission of the statement of defence, but a Party is not precluded from raising that plea by the fact that the Party has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>44. A plea that an Arbitral Tribunal is exceeding the scope of its jurisdiction will be made as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its jurisdiction is raised during the arbitral proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>45. An Arbitral Tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in Section 43 or 44, admit a later plea where it considers the delay justified.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>46. An Arbitral Tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in Section 43 or 44 either as a preliminary question or in the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>47. Where an Arbitral Tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any Party, within 15 days after having received notice of that ruling, may request the Supreme Court to decide the matter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>48. A decision of the Supreme Court under Section 47 is final and is not subject to appeal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>49. While a request under Section 47 is pending, an Arbitral Tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an Arbitral Award unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the Supreme Court is made would unduly prejudice the Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the Parties agree otherwise.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>INTERIM MEASURES ORDERED BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>50. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may, at the request of a Party, order a Party to take any interim measure of protection as the Arbitral Tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject matter of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>51. The Arbitral Tribunal may require a Party to provide appropriate security in connection with a measure ordered under Section 50.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>EQUAL TREATMENT OF PARTIES</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>52. The Parties will be treated with equality and each Party will be given a full opportunity to present its case.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DETERMINATION OF RULES OF PROCEDURE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>53. Subject to this Appendix, the Parties may agree on the procedure to be followed by the Arbitral Tribunal in conducting the proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>54. Failing any agreement under Section 53, the Arbitral Tribunal, subject to this Appendix, may conduct the arbitration in the manner it considers appropriate.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>55. The Arbitral Tribunal is not required to apply the legal rules of evidence, and may determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>56. The Arbitral Tribunal will make all reasonable efforts to conduct the arbitral proceedings in the most efficient, expeditious and cost-effective manner as is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>57. The Arbitral Tribunal may extend or abridge a period of time:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. set out in this Appendix, except the period specified in Section 106; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. established by the tribunal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>PRE-HEARING MEETING</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>58. Within 10 days after the Arbitral Tribunal is established, the tribunal will convene a pre-hearing meeting of the Parties to reach agreement and to make any necessary orders on:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. any procedural issues arising under this Appendix;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. selection of the Arbitral Tribunal's chair where applicable;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the procedure to be followed in the arbitration;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the time periods for taking steps in the arbitration;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. the scheduling of hearings or meetings, if any;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>f. any preliminary applications or objections; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>g. any other matter which will assist the arbitration to proceed in an efficient and expeditious manner.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>59. The Arbitral Tribunal will prepare and distribute promptly to the Parties a written record of all the business transacted, and decisions and orders made, at the pre-hearing meeting.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>60. The pre-hearing meeting may be conducted by conference call.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>PLACE OF ARBITRATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>61. The arbitration will take place in British Columbia.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>62. Notwithstanding Section 61, an Arbitral Tribunal may meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the Parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or other personal property, or for viewing physical locations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>LANGUAGE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>63. Where the Arbitral Tribunal determines that it was necessary or reasonable for a Party to incur the costs of translation of documents and oral presentations in the circumstances of a particular Disagreement, the Arbitral Tribunal, on application of a Party, may order that any of the costs of that translation be deemed to be costs of the arbitration under paragraph 42 of the Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>STATEMENTS OF CLAIM AND DEFENCE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>64. Within 21 days after the Arbitral Tribunal is established, the Applicant will deliver a written statement to all the Parties stating the facts supporting its claim or position, the points at issue and the relief or remedy sought.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>65. Within 15 days after receipt of the Applicant's statement, each Respondent will deliver a written statement to all the Parties stating its defence or position in respect of those particulars.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>66. Each Party will attach to its statement a list of documents:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. upon which the Party intends to rely; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. which describes each document by kind, date, author, addressee and subject matter.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>67. The Parties may amend or supplement their statements, including the list of documents, and deliver counter-claims and defences to counter-claims during the course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the Arbitral Tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow the amendment, supplement or additional pleadings having regard to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the delay in making it; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. any prejudice suffered by the other Parties.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>68. The Parties will deliver copies of all amended, supplemented or new documents delivered under Section 67 to all the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DISCLOSURE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>69. The Arbitral Tribunal may order a Party to produce, within a specified time, any documents that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. have not been listed under Section 66;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the Party has in its care, custody or control; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the Arbitral Tribunal considers to be relevant.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>70. Each Party will allow the other Parties the necessary access at reasonable times to inspect and take copies of all documents that the former Party has listed under Section 66, or that the Arbitral Tribunal has ordered to be produced under Section 69.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>71. The Parties will prepare and send to the Arbitral Tribunal an agreed statement of facts within the time specified by the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>72. No later than 21 days before a hearing commences, each Party will give the other Parties:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the name and address of any witness and a written summary of the witness's evidence; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. in the case of an expert witness, a written statement or report prepared by the expert witness.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>73. No later than 15 days before a hearing commences, each Party will provide to the other Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal an assembly of all documents to be introduced at the hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>HEARINGS AND WRITTEN PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>74. The Parties may agree in writing that no hearings will be held.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>75. Subject to Section 74, the Arbitral Tribunal will hold hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so requested by a Party.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>76. Subject to Sections 74 and 75, the Arbitral Tribunal has the authority to decide whether to hold hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the proceedings will be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>77. The Arbitral Tribunal will give the Parties sufficient advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the Arbitral Tribunal for the purpose of inspection of documents, goods or other property or viewing any physical location.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>78. All statements, documents or other information supplied to, or applications made to, the Arbitral Tribunal by one Party will be communicated to the other Parties, and any expert report or evidentiary document on which the Arbitral Tribunal may rely in making its decision will be communicated to the Parties.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>79. Unless ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal, all hearings and meetings in arbitral proceedings, other than meetings of the Arbitral Tribunal, are open to the public.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>80. The Arbitral Tribunal will schedule hearings to be held on consecutive days until completion, unless the Parties agree otherwise.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>81. All oral evidence will be taken in the presence of the Arbitral Tribunal and all the Parties unless a Party is absent by default or has waived the right to be present.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>82. The Arbitral Tribunal may order any individual to be examined by the Arbitral Tribunal under oath or on affirmation in relation to the Disagreement and to produce before the Arbitral Tribunal all relevant documents within the individual's care, custody or control.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>83. The document assemblies delivered under Section 73 will be deemed to have been entered into evidence at the hearing without further proof and without being read out at the hearing, but a Party may challenge the admissibility of any document so introduced.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>84. Where the Arbitral Tribunal considers it just and reasonable to do so, the Arbitral Tribunal may permit a document that was not previously listed under Section 66, or produced as required under Section 69 or 73, to be introduced at the hearing, but the Arbitral Tribunal may take that failure into account when fixing the costs to be awarded in the arbitration.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>85. Where the Arbitral Tribunal permits the evidence of a witness to be presented as a written statement, any of the other Parties may require that witness to be made available for cross examination at the hearing.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>86. The Arbitral Tribunal may order a witness to appear and give evidence and, in that event, the Parties may cross examine that witness and call evidence in rebuttal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DEFAULT OF A PARTY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>87. Where, without showing sufficient cause, the Applicant fails to comply with Section 64, the Arbitral Tribunal may terminate the proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>88. Where, without showing sufficient cause, a Respondent fails to comply with Section 65, the Arbitral Tribunal will continue the proceedings without treating that failure in itself as an admission of the Applicant's allegations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>89. Where, without showing sufficient cause, a Party fails to appear at the hearing or to produce documentary evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal may continue the proceedings and make the Arbitral Award on the evidence before it.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>90. Before terminating the proceedings under Section 87, the Arbitral Tribunal will give all Respondents written notice providing an opportunity to file a statement of claim in respect of the Disagreement within a specified period of time.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>EXPERT APPOINTED BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>91. After consulting the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. appoint one or more experts to report to it on specific issues to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. for that purpose, require a Party to give the expert any relevant information or to produce, or to provide access to, any relevant documents, goods or other personal property or land for inspection or viewing.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>92. The Arbitral Tribunal will give a copy of the expert's report to the Parties who will have an opportunity to reply to it.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>93. Where a Party so requests, or if the Arbitral Tribunal considers it necessary, the expert will, after delivery of a written or oral report, participate in a hearing where the Parties will have the opportunity to cross examine the expert and to call any evidence in rebuttal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>94. The expert will, on the request of a Party:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. make available to that Party for examination all documents, goods or other property in the expert's possession, and provided to the expert in order to prepare a report; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. provide that Party with a list of all documents, goods or other personal property or land not in the expert's possession, but which were provided to or given access to the expert, and a description of the location of those documents, goods or other personal property or lands.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>LAW APPLICABLE TO SUBSTANCE OF DISPUTE</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>95. An Arbitral Tribunal will decide the Disagreement in accordance with the law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>96. Where the Parties have expressly authorized it to do so, an Arbitral Tribunal may decide the Disagreement based upon equitable considerations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>97. In all cases, an Arbitral Tribunal will make its decisions in accordance with the spirit and intent of this Agreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>98. Before a final Arbitral Award is made, an Arbitral Tribunal or a Party, with the agreement of the other Parties, may refer a question of law to the Supreme Court for a ruling.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>99. A Party may appeal a decision of the Supreme Court under Section 98 to the British Columbia Court of Appeal with leave of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Where the British Columbia Court of Appeal:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. refuses to grant leave to a Party to appeal a ruling of the Supreme Court under Section 98; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. hears an appeal from a ruling of the Supreme Court under Section 98,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal may not be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>100. While a request under Section 98 is pending, the Arbitral Tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an Arbitral Award unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the costs occasioned by proceeding before the ruling of the Supreme Court is made would unduly prejudice the Parties; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the Parties agree otherwise.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>DECISION MAKING BY PANEL OF ARBITRATORS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>101. In arbitral proceedings with more than one arbitrator, any decision of the Arbitral Tribunal will be made by a majority of all its members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>102. Where there is no majority decision on a matter to be decided, the decision of the chair of the Arbitral Tribunal is the decision of the tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>103. Notwithstanding Section 101, where authorized by the Parties or all the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, questions of procedure may be decided by the chair of the tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>SETTLEMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>104. Where, during arbitral proceedings, the Parties settle the Disagreement, the Arbitral Tribunal will terminate the proceedings and, if requested by the Parties, will record the settlement in the form of an Arbitral Award on agreed terms.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>105. An Arbitral Award on agreed terms:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. will be made in accordance with Sections 107 to 109;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. will state that it is an Arbitral Award; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. has the same status and effect as any other Arbitral Award on the substance of the Disagreement.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>FORM AND CONTENT OF ARBITRAL AWARD</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>106. An Arbitral Tribunal will make its final award as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than 60 days after:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the hearings have been closed; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the final submission has been made,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>whichever is the later date.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>107. An Arbitral Award will be made in writing and be signed by the members of the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>108. An Arbitral Award will state the reasons upon which it is based, unless:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the Parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the award is an Arbitral Award on agreed terms under Sections 104 and 105.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>109. A signed copy of an Arbitral Award will be delivered to all the Parties by the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>110. At any time during the arbitral proceedings, an Arbitral Tribunal may make an interim Arbitral Award on any matter with respect to which it may make a final Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>111. An Arbitral Tribunal may award interest.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>112. The costs of an arbitration are in the discretion of the Arbitral Tribunal which, in making an order for costs, may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. include as costs:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and expert witnesses;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. legal fees and expenses of the Parties;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii. any administration fees of a Neutral Appointing Authority; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iv. any other expenses incurred in connection with the arbitral proceedings; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b. specify:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. the Party entitled to costs;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. the Party who will pay the costs;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii. subject to Section 113, the amount of costs or method of determining that amount; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iv. the manner in which the costs will be paid.</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent1>113. For purposes of Section 112, an Arbitral Tribunal may award up to 50% of the reasonable and necessary legal fees and expenses that were actually incurred by a Party, and where the legal services were provided by an employee or employees of that Party, the Arbitral Tribunal may fix an amount or determine an hourly rate to be used in the calculation of the cost of those employee legal fees.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>TERMINATION OF PROCEEDINGS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>114. An Arbitral Tribunal will close any hearings where:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the Parties advise they have no further evidence to give or submissions to make; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the tribunal considers further hearings to be unnecessary or inappropriate.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>115. A final Arbitral Award, or an order of the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 116, terminates arbitral proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>116. An Arbitral Tribunal will issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings where:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the Applicant withdraws its claim, unless the Respondent objects to the order and the Arbitral Tribunal recognizes a legitimate interest in obtaining a final settlement of the Disagreement;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the Parties agree on the termination of the proceedings; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>117. Subject to Sections 118 to 123 and Section 127, the mandate of an Arbitral Tribunal terminates with the termination of the arbitral proceedings.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>CORRECTION AND INTERPRETATION OF AWARD AND ADDITIONAL AWARD</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>118. Within 30 days after receipt of an Arbitral Award a Party may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. request the Arbitral Tribunal to correct in the award any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. where agreed by all the Parties, request the Arbitral Tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>119. Where an Arbitral Tribunal considers a request made under Section 118 to be justified, it will make the correction or give the interpretation within 30 days after receipt of the request and the interpretation will form part of the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>120. An Arbitral Tribunal, on its own initiative, may correct any error of the type referred to in Subsection 118. a within 30 days after the date of the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>121. A Party may request, within 30 days after receipt of an Arbitral Award, the Arbitral Tribunal to make an additional Arbitral Award respecting claims presented in the arbitral proceedings, but omitted from the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>122. Where the Arbitral Tribunal considers a request made under Section 121 to be justified, it will make an additional Arbitral Award within 60 days.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>123. Sections 107 to 109 and Sections 111 to 113 apply to a correction or interpretation of an Arbitral Award made under Section 119 or 120, or to an additional Arbitral Award made under Section 122.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPLICATION FOR SETTING ASIDE ARBITRAL AWARD</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>124. Subject to Sections 129 and 131, an Arbitral Award may be set aside by the Supreme Court, and no other court, only where a Party making the application establishes that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the Party making the application:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. was otherwise unable to present its case or respond to another Party's case;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b. the Arbitral Award:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. deals with a Disagreement not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, where the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the Arbitral Award that contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>c. the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the Parties, unless that agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Appendix from which the Parties cannot derogate or, failing any agreement, was not in accordance with this Appendix;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the Arbitral Tribunal or a member of it has committed a corrupt or fraudulent act; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. the award was obtained by fraud.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>125. An application for setting aside may not be made more than three months:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. after the date on which the Party making that application received the Arbitral Award; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. where a request was made under Section 118 or 121, after the date on which that request was disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>126. An application to set aside an Arbitral Award on the ground that the Arbitral Tribunal or a member of it has committed a corrupt or fraudulent act or that the award was obtained by fraud will be commenced:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. within the period referred to in Section 125; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. within 30 days after the Applicant discovers or ought to have discovered the fraud or corrupt or fraudulent act,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>whichever is the longer period.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>127. When asked to set aside an Arbitral Award, the Supreme Court may, where it is appropriate and it is requested by a Party, adjourn the proceedings to set aside the Arbitral Award for a period of time determined by it in order to give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. resume the arbitral proceedings; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. take any other action that, in the Arbitral Tribunal's opinion, will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>128. Where Canada, British Columbia or the Tla'amin Nation was not a Party in an arbitration, it will be given notice of an application under Section 124 and is entitled to be a Party to, and make representation on, the application.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>APPEAL ON QUESTION OF LAW</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>129. A Party may appeal an Arbitral Award to the Supreme Court, with leave, on a question of law, which the Supreme Court will grant only where it is satisfied that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the importance of the result of the arbitration to the Parties justifies the intervention of the court, and the determination of the point of law may prevent a miscarriage of justice; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the point of law is of general or public importance.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>130. An application for leave may not be made more than three months:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. after the date on which the Party making the application received the Arbitral Award; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. where a request was made under Section 118 or 121, after the date on which that request was disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>131. The Supreme Court may confirm, vary or set aside the Arbitral Award or may remit the award to the Arbitral Tribunal with directions, including the court's opinion on the question of law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>132. When an Arbitral Award is appealed on a question of law, the Supreme Court may, where it is appropriate and it is requested by a Party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. resume the arbitral proceedings; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. take any other action that, in the Arbitral Tribunal's opinion, will eliminate the grounds for appealing the Arbitral Award.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>133. Where Canada, British Columbia or the Tla'amin Nation was not a Party in an arbitration, it will be given notice of an application under Section 129 and is entitled to be a Party to, and make representation on the application.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>134. A Party may appeal a decision of the Supreme Court under Section 131 to the British Columbia Court of Appeal with leave of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>135. Where the British Columbia Court of Appeal:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. refuses to grant leave to a Party to appeal a ruling of the Supreme Court under Section 131; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. hears an appeal from a ruling of the Supreme Court under Section 131,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal may not be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>136. No application may be made under Section 129 in respect of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. an Arbitral Award based upon equitable considerations as permitted in Section 96; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. an Arbitral Award made in an arbitration commenced under paragraph 27 of the Chapter.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>137. No application for leave may be brought under Section 129 in respect of a ruling made by the Supreme Court under Section 98 if the time for appealing that ruling has already expired.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>ENFORCEMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>138. An Arbitral Award is binding and, upon application to the Supreme Court, will be enforced subject to paragraphs 192 and 193 of the Governance Chapter.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>139. Unless the Supreme Court orders otherwise, the Party relying on an Arbitral Award or applying for its enforcement will supply the duly authenticated original Arbitral Award or a duly certified copy of it.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong>GROUNDS FOR REFUSING ENFORCEMENT</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>140. Subject to Sections 128 and 133, where Canada, British Columbia or the Tla'amin Nation was not a Party in an arbitration, it will not bring an application under Section 124 or 129 to set aside or appeal the Arbitral Award, but may resist enforcement of the award against it by bringing an application under Section 141.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>141. On the application of Canada, British Columbia or the Tla'amin Nation where it was not a Party in an arbitration, the Supreme Court may make an order refusing to enforce against it an Arbitral Award made under this Appendix where it establishes that:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. it was not given copies of:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. the notice of arbitration or agreement to arbitrate; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. the pleadings or all amendments and supplements to the pleadings;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b. the Arbitral Tribunal refused to add it as a Party to the arbitration under paragraph 31 of the Chapter;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the Arbitral Award:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. deals with a Disagreement not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration; or</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration,</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the Arbitral Award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be enforced;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the Arbitral Award has not yet become binding on the Parties or has been set aside or suspended by a court;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. the Arbitral Tribunal or a member of it has committed a corrupt or fraudulent act; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>f. the Arbitral Award was obtained by fraud.</bcl:indent2></bcl:schedule></act:content><bcl:multinav><bcl:navpage><bcl:navtitle>Contents</bcl:navtitle><bcl:navxmlfile>13002_00</bcl:navxmlfile></bcl:navpage><bcl:navpage><bcl:navtitle>Sections 1 to 28</bcl:navtitle><bcl:navxmlfile>13002_01</bcl:navxmlfile></bcl:navpage><bcl:navpage><bcl:navtitle>Schedule -
