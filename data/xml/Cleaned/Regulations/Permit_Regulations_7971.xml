      <bcl:text>Priority in the granting of grazing permits may be given to those local applicants who can carry their stock on their property during the period the management area pasture is not available. Where the demand for management area pasture by stock owners falling into this category reaches the point where it exceeds the supply available, preference may be given to those who have been making, and continue to make, constant use of the management area range. A priority is normally maintained only by actual use under a grazing permit. A reduction in actual use under a permit of up to 10% below the established priority for one year only will be considered a normal operating fluctuation and will not normally reduce the priority. Any minor reduction in actual use under a grazing permit below the priority for 2 successive years, or reduced use of more than 10% at any time, may result in reduction of the priority.</bcl:text>
