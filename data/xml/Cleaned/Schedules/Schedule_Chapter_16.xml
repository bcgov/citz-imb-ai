Tsawwassen First Nation has the right to self-government, and the authority to make laws, as set out in this Agreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>2. Tsawwassen Government, as provided for under the Tsawwassen Constitution and this Agreement, is the government of Tsawwassen First Nation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>3. The rights, powers, privileges and authorities of Tsawwassen First Nation will be exercised in accordance with Tsawwassen Laws, including the Tsawwassen Constitution, and with this Agreement.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>4. For greater certainty, the authority of Tsawwassen Government to make laws in respect of a subject matter as set out in this Agreement includes the authority to make laws and do other things as may be necessarily incidental to exercising that authority.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>5. Tsawwassen First Nation will act through Tsawwassen Government in exercising its rights, powers, privileges and authorities, and in carrying out its duties, functions and obligations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>6. Subject to requirements to make laws under this Agreement, Tsawwassen First Nation may exercise the law-making authorities set out in this Agreement over time.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-2"/>LEGAL STATUS AND CAPACITY</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>7.

The individuals who were the Chief Councillor and Councillors of the Tsawwassen First Nation band council under the <in:doc>Indian Act</in:doc> on the day immediately before the Effective Date are the chief and legislative members, respectively, of Tsawwassen Government from the Effective Date until the office holders elected in the first election for Tsawwassen Government take office.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-5"/>TSAWWASSEN ELECTIONS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>11. The first election for Tsawwassen Government will be held no later than six months after the Effective Date.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>12.

Tsawwassen First Nation will establish procedures for appeal or review of administrative decisions made by Tsawwassen First Nation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution and, if those procedures provide for a right of appeal to a court for a decision made under a Tsawwassen Law, the Supreme Court of British Columbia has jurisdiction to hear those appeals.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>14. An application may be made to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for judicial review of an administrative decision made by Tsawwassen First Nation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution under a Tsawwassen Law, and the Supreme Court of British Columbia has jurisdiction to hear any such application, but no such application may be brought until all procedures for appeal or review provided by Tsawwassen First Nation under clause 13, and applicable to that decision, have been exhausted.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>15. The <in:doc>Judicial Review Procedure Act</in:doc> applies to an application for judicial review under clause 14, and Provincial Settlement Legislation will provide that the <in:doc>Judicial Review Procedure Act</in:doc> is amended to include Tsawwassen Law in the definition of enactment.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-7"/>REGISTRY OF LAWS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>16. Tsawwassen Government will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. maintain a public registry of Tsawwassen Laws in the English language which version is authoritative and, at the discretion of Tsawwassen First Nation, in the Hun'qum'i'num language;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. provide Canada and British Columbia with copies of Tsawwassen Laws as soon as practicable after they are enacted, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. establish procedures for determining the coming into force and providing for the publication of Tsawwassen Laws.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-8"/>PARTICIPATION OF NON-MEMBERS</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>17. Tsawwassen First Nation will provide that Tsawwassen Institutions will Consult with Non-Members in respect of decisions of Tsawwassen Institutions that directly and significantly affect those Non-Members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>18. Tsawwassen First Nation will provide that Non-Members may participate in the decision-making processes of a Tsawwassen Public Institution if the activities of that Tsawwassen Public Institution directly and significantly affect Non-Members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>19. The means of participation under clause 18 will include:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. if members of a Tsawwassen Public Institution are elected, an opportunity for Non-Members to vote for and stand for election as a member of the Tsawwassen Public Institution with the ability to participate in discussions and to vote on matters that directly and significantly affect Non-Members;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. if members of a Tsawwassen Public Institution are not elected, at least one member of the Tsawwassen Public Institution will be a Non-Member selected by Non-Members with the ability to participate in discussions and to vote on matters that directly and significantly affect Non-Members; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. other comparable measures.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>20. Despite clause 19, Tsawwassen First Nation may provide that a majority of the members of the Tsawwassen Public Institution must be Tsawwassen Members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>21. Tsawwassen First Nation will establish the means of participation under clause 18 by law at the same time that it establishes a Tsawwassen Public Institution whose activities may directly and significantly affect Non-Members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>22. Tsawwassen First Nation will provide Non-Members with access to the appeal and review procedures established under clause 13 in respect of activities that directly and significantly affect Non-Members.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-9"/>NOTIFICATION OF TSAWWASSEN LAW-MAKING</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>23. Before Tsawwassen Government brings into force any Tsawwassen Law in respect of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. adoption;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. Child Protection Services;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. health services;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. social services;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. Child Care services; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>f. kindergarten to grade 12 education,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>Tsawwassen Government will give at least six months written notice of the proposed Tsawwassen Law to Canada and British Columbia.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>24. Despite clause 23, after giving the notice referred to in clause 23, Tsawwassen Government may bring into force the Tsawwassen Law within the six month period if Canada and British Columbia agree.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>25. The Parties may negotiate and attempt to reach agreements in respect of any of the matters set out in clause 26 or 27, but an agreement under those clauses is not a condition precedent to the exercise of law-making authority by Tsawwassen Government, and such authority may be exercised immediately following the six month notice period referred to in clause 23.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>26. If Canada or British Columbia makes a request in writing within three months of being given notice under clause 23, Tsawwassen First Nation will Consult with Canada or British Columbia, as the case may be, in respect of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. options the Parties could take to address the interests of Tsawwassen First Nation through methods other than law-making;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. immunity of individuals providing services or exercising authority under Tsawwassen Law;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. readiness and quality assurance; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. other matters as the Parties may agree.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>27. At the written request of any Party within three months of notice being provided under clause 23, the relevant Parties will discuss:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. any transfer of cases and related documentation from federal or provincial institutions to Tsawwassen Institutions, including any confidentiality and privacy considerations;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. any transfer of assets from federal or provincial institutions to Tsawwassen Institutions;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. any appropriate amendments to Federal or Provincial Laws; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. other matters as the Parties may agree.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>28. If, in the notice referred to in clause 23, Tsawwassen First Nation advises that it is proposing a Tsawwassen Law for reasons of emergency, Canada and British Columbia will respond as soon as practicable.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-10"/>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO PROVINCIAL LEGISLATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>29. Subject to clause 35 or an agreement under clause 32, before British Columbia introduces legislation in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, or before the Lieutenant Governor in Council approves a regulation, British Columbia will notify, in writing, Tsawwassen First Nation if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. this Agreement provides for Tsawwassen Government law-making authority in respect of the subject matter of the legislation or regulation;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the legislation or regulation may affect the protections, immunities, limitations in respect of liability, remedies over, or rights referred to in clauses 163 and 164; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the legislation or regulation may affect the rights, powers, duties, obligations, or the protections, immunities, limitations in respect of liability, remedies over, or rights referred to in clause 113;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>except where this cannot be done for reasons of emergency or confidentiality.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>30. If British Columbia does not notify Tsawwassen First Nation under clause 29 for reasons of emergency or confidentiality, British Columbia will notify, in writing, Tsawwassen First Nation, as soon as practicable, that it has introduced legislation in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, or deposited a regulation with the Registrar of Regulations.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>31. Notifications under clauses 29 and 30 will include:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the nature and purpose of the proposed legislation or regulation; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the date that the proposed legislation or regulation is anticipated to take effect, if it has not already done so.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>32. Tsawwassen First Nation and British Columbia may negotiate and attempt to reach agreements establishing alternatives to the obligations that would otherwise apply under clauses 29, 30, 31 and 33.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>33. Subject to clauses 34 and 35, or an agreement under clause 32, if Tsawwassen First Nation makes a written request to British Columbia, then British Columbia and Tsawwassen First Nation will discuss the effect, if any, of the legislation or regulation on:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. a Tsawwassen Law; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the matters referred to in subclauses 29.b and 29.c.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>34. If British Columbia establishes a process providing for collective discussions with First Nation Governments in British Columbia concerning matters referred to in clause 33, Tsawwassen First Nation will participate in that process and the process will satisfy the obligations of British Columbia under clause 33.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>35. If Tsawwassen First Nation is a member of a representative body and British Columbia has entered into an agreement with the body that provides for consultation in respect of matters referred to in clause 29, 30, 31, and 33, then consultations between British Columbia and that representative body in respect of a particular matter will satisfy the obligations on British Columbia to provide notice under clauses 29 and 30 and discussion under clause 33.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>36. Unless British Columbia agrees otherwise, Tsawwassen First Nation will retain the information provided under clauses 29 through 35 in strict confidence until such time, if ever, the proposed legislation is given first reading in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia or the regulation is deposited with the Registrar of Regulations, as applicable.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>37. The Parties acknowledge that nothing in clauses 29 through 35 is intended to interfere with the legislative process of British Columbia.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>38. Despite any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that provincial legislation or a regulation referred to in clause 29 affects the validity of a Tsawwassen Law, the Tsawwassen Law will be valid for a period of six months or until it is amended, whichever is the shorter period, after the coming into force of the provincial legislation or regulation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-11"/>DELEGATION</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>39. Any law-making authority of Tsawwassen Government under this Agreement may be delegated by a Tsawwassen Law to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. a Tsawwassen Public Institution;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. another First Nation Government in British Columbia;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. a public institution established by one or more First Nation Governments in British Columbia;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>d. British Columbia;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>e. Canada;</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>f. a Local Government; or</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>g. a legal entity as agreed by the Parties,</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>if the delegation and the exercise of any law-making authority is in accordance with this Agreement and the Tsawwassen Constitution.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>40. Any authority of Tsawwassen First Nation under this Agreement other than a law-making authority may be delegated by a Tsawwassen Law to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>a. any body set out in clause 39; or</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>b. a legal entity in Canada</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>if the delegation and the exercise of any delegated authority is in accordance with this Agreement and the Tsawwassen Constitution.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>41. Any delegation under subclauses 39.b through 39.g or clause 40 requires the written consent of the delegate.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>42. Tsawwassen First Nation may receive a delegated authority by agreement, including a law-making authority.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-12"/>TSAWWASSEN FIRST NATION LAW-MAKING AUTHORITIES</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-12-1"/>Tsawwassen Government</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>43. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of the election, administration, management and operation of Tsawwassen Government including:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the establishment of Tsawwassen Public Institutions, including their respective powers, duties, composition and membership, but the registration or incorporation of the Tsawwassen Public Institution must be under Federal or Provincial Law;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. the powers, duties, responsibilities, remuneration and indemnification of members, officials, employees and appointees of Tsawwassen Institutions;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. the establishment of a Tsawwassen Corporation, but the registration or incorporation of the Tsawwassen Corporation must be under Federal or Provincial Law;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. the financial administration of Tsawwassen First Nation and Tsawwassen Institutions; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>e. elections, by-elections and referenda.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>44. In accordance with clause 22 of the General Provisions chapter, nothing in clause 43 confers authority on Tsawwassen Government to make laws in respect of labour relations and working conditions.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>45. Tsawwassen Government will make laws to:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. provide Tsawwassen Members with reasonable access to information in the custody or control of a Tsawwassen Institution; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. provide Persons other than Tsawwassen Members with reasonable access to information in the custody or control of a Tsawwassen Institution regarding matters that directly and significantly affect those Persons.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>46. For greater certainty, a Tsawwassen Law made under clause 45 need not provide access to information of a kind that is generally unavailable under Federal or Provincial Law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>47. A Tsawwassen Law made under clause 43 or 45 prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Federal or Provincial Law, except that a Federal or Provincial Law in respect of the protection of personal information prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law made under clause 43 or 45.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-12-2"/>Tsawwassen Membership</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>48. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of membership in Tsawwassen First Nation.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>49. A Tsawwassen Law made under clause 48 prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Federal or Provincial Law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>50. The conferring of membership in Tsawwassen First Nation does not:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. confer or deny rights of entry into Canada, Canadian citizenship, or the right to be registered as an Indian under the <in:doc>Indian Act</in:doc>; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. except as set out in this Agreement or in Federal or Provincial Law, impose any obligation on Canada or British Columbia to provide rights or benefits.</bcl:indent2><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-12-3"/>Tsawwassen Assets</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>51. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of the use, possession, management and Disposition of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. assets located on Tsawwassen Lands;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. assets located off Tsawwassen Lands; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. Other Tsawwassen Lands as an asset,</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>of Tsawwassen First Nation, a Tsawwassen Corporation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>52. For greater certainty, the law-making authority in clause 51 does not include the authority to make laws in respect of creditors' rights and remedies.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>53. A Tsawwassen Law made under subclause 51.a prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Federal or Provincial Law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>54. A Federal or Provincial Law prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law made under subclause 51.b or 51.c.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-12-4"/>Adoption</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>55. In determining a Child's best interests, all relevant factors will be considered including those factors that must be considered under the <in:doc>Adoption Act</in:doc>.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>56. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. adoption of Tsawwassen Children in British Columbia;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. adoption in British Columbia by Tsawwassen Members of Children who reside on Tsawwassen Lands; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. adoption in British Columbia of Children of Tsawwassen Members in accordance with clause 60.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>57. Tsawwassen Laws under clause 56 will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. expressly provide that the best interests of the Child are the paramount consideration in determining whether an adoption will take place; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. provide for the consent of individuals whose consent to a Child's adoption is required under Provincial Law, subject to the power of the court to dispense with such consent under Provincial Law.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>58. If Tsawwassen Government makes laws under clause 56, Tsawwassen First Nation will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. develop operational and practice standards that promote the best interests of the Child;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. participate in British Columbia's information management systems, or establish an information management system that is compatible with British Columbia's information management systems, concerning the management, storage and disposal of adoption records and the safeguarding of personal adoption information; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. provide British Columbia and Canada with a record of all adoptions occurring under Tsawwassen Law.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>59. A Tsawwassen Law made under clause 56 applies to the adoption of a Tsawwassen Child residing off Tsawwassen Lands if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. the Tsawwassen Child has not been placed for adoption under the <in:doc>Adoption Act</in:doc>, and all of the following consent to the application of Tsawwassen Law to the adoption:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. the parents of the Tsawwassen Child;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. if the Tsawwassen Child has reached the age where consent to adoption is required under the <in:doc>Adoption Act</in:doc>, the Tsawwassen Child; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii. if the Tsawwassen Child is not under the guardianship of a Director, the guardian of the Tsawwassen Child;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b. a Director designated under the <in:doc>Child, Family and Community Service Act</in:doc> is guardian of the Tsawwassen Child, and the Director consents in accordance with subclauses 62.c and 62.d; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. a court dispenses with the requirement for the consent referred to in subclause 59.a, in accordance with the criteria that would be used by that court in an application to dispense with the requirement for a parent's or guardian's consent to an adoption under Provincial Law.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>60. A Tsawwassen Law made under clause 56 applies to the adoption of a Child of a Tsawwassen Member or a Child residing on Tsawwassen Lands who is not a Tsawwassen Child if:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. before the Child is placed for adoption under Tsawwassen Law, all of the following consent to the application of Tsawwassen Law to the adoption:</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent3>i. the parents of the Child;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>ii. if the Child has reached the age where consent to adoption is required under the <in:doc>Adoption Act</in:doc>, the Child; and</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent3>iii. if the Child is not under the guardianship of a Director, the guardian of the Child;</bcl:indent3><bcl:indent2>b. a Director designated under the <in:doc>Child, Family and Community Service Act</in:doc> is guardian of the Child and the Director consents to the application of Tsawwassen Law to the adoption of that Child provided that it is in the best interests of the Child; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. a court dispenses with the requirement for the consent referred to in subclause 60.a, in accordance with the criteria that would be used by that court in an application to dispense with the requirement for a parent's or guardian's consent to an adoption under Provincial Law.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>61. The Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on the information that will be included in the record provided under subclause 58.c.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>62. If a Director designated under the <in:doc>Child, Family and Community Service Act</in:doc>, or a successor to that position, becomes the guardian of a Tsawwassen Child, the Director will:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. provide notice to Tsawwassen First Nation that the Director is the guardian of the Tsawwassen Child;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. provide notice to Tsawwassen First Nation when the Director applies for a continuing custody order for the Tsawwassen Child, provide Tsawwassen First Nation with a copy of the continuing custody order once the order is made and make reasonable efforts to involve Tsawwassen First Nation in planning for the Tsawwassen Child;</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>c. if requested by Tsawwassen First Nation, consent to the application of Tsawwassen Law to the adoption of the Tsawwassen Child provided that it is in the best interests of the Tsawwassen Child; and</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>d. in determining the best interests of the Tsawwassen Child under subclause 62.c., the Director will consider the importance of preserving the Tsawwassen Child's cultural identity.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>63.

Clause 160 does not absolve any of the corporations or bodies referred to in the definition of Tsawwassen Public Officer from vicarious liability arising out of a tort committed by a Tsawwassen Public Officer for which the corporation or body would have been liable had that clause not been in effect.</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent1>163. Despite clause 160, a Tsawwassen Public Officer does not have protections, immunities or limitations in respect of liability, in respect of the provision of a service, if no persons delivering reasonably similar programs or services under Federal or Provincial Law have protections, immunities, limitations in respect of liability and rights under Federal or Provincial Law, except as may be otherwise provided under Federal or Provincial Law.</bcl:indent1><bcl:lefttext><in:strong><in:a name="CH16-13-3"/>Tsawwassen First Nation and Tsawwassen Government</in:strong></bcl:lefttext><bcl:indent1>164.

Without limiting clause 164, but subject to clauses 7 and 8 of the Lands chapter, no real or personal property of Tsawwassen First Nation or a Tsawwassen Public Institution is subject to seizure or sale under a Writ of Execution, order for sale or other process without leave of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and the court, in granting or refusing leave under this clause, may:</bcl:indent1><bcl:indent2>a. permit the issuance of the writ, make the order or allow the other process at a time and on conditions the court considers proper; or</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent2>b. refuse to permit the writ to be issued or suspend action under it, or deny the order or other process, on terms and conditions the court considers proper or expedient.</bcl:indent2><bcl:indent1>167.
