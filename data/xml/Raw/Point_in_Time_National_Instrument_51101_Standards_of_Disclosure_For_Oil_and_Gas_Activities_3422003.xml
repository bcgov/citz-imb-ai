      <bcl:indent1>1. We have [audited] [evaluated] [and reviewed] the Company's reserves data as at [last day of the reporting issuer's most recently completed financial year]. The reserves data are estimates of proved reserves and probable reserves and related future net revenue as at [last day of the reporting issuer's most recently completed financial year], estimated using forecast prices and costs.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>2. The reserves data are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the reserves data based on our [audit] [evaluation] [and review].</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>We carried out our [audit] [evaluation] [and review] in accordance with standards set out in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the "COGE Handbook") prepared jointly by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (Calgary Chapter) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy &amp; Petroleum (Petroleum Society).</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>3. Those standards require that we plan and perform an [audit] [evaluation] [and review] to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the reserves data are free of material misstatement. An [audit] [evaluation] [and review] also includes assessing whether the reserves data are in accordance with principles and definitions presented in the COGE Handbook.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>4. The following table sets forth the estimated future net revenue (before deduction of income taxes) attributed to proved plus probable reserves, estimated using forecast prices and costs and calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent, included in the reserves data of the Company [audited] [evaluated] [and reviewed] by us for the year ended xxx xx, 20xx, and identifies the respective portions thereof that we have [audited] [evaluated] [and reviewed] and reported on to the Company's [management/board of directors]:</bcl:indent1>
