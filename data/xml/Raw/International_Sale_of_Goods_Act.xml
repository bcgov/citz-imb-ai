        <in:strong>United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
          Goods</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>BEARING IN MIND the broad objectives in the resolutions adopted by the sixth
        special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the establishment of a New
        International Economic Order,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>CONSIDERING that the development of international trade on the basis of equality
        and mutual benefit is an important element in promoting friendly relations among
        States,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>BEING OF THE OPINION that the adoption of uniform rules which govern contracts
        for the international sale of goods and take into account the different social, economic and
        legal systems would contribute to the removal of legal barriers in international trade and
        promote the development of international trade,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>HAVE AGREED as follows:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Part I Sphere of Application and General Provisions</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Chapter I Sphere of Application</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 1</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) This Convention applies to contracts of sale of goods between parties whose
        places of business are in different States:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) when the States are Contracting States; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) when the rules of private international law lead to the application of the law
          of a Contracting State.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The fact that the parties have their places of business in different States
        is to be disregarded whenever this fact does not appear either from the contract or from any
        dealings between, or from information disclosed by, the parties at any time before or at the
        conclusion of the contract.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) Neither the nationality of the parties nor the civil or commercial character
        of the parties or of the contract is to be taken into consideration in determining the
        application of this Convention.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 2</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>This Convention does not apply to sales:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) of goods bought for personal, family or household use, unless the seller, at any
          time before or at the conclusion of the contract, neither knew nor ought to have known
          that the goods were bought for any such use;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) by auction;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(c) on execution or otherwise by authority of law;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(d) of stocks, shares, investment securities, negotiable instruments or
          money;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(e) of ships, vessels, hovercraft or aircraft;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(f) of electricity.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 3</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) Contracts for the supply of goods to be manufactured or produced are to be
        considered sales unless the party who orders the goods undertakes to supply a substantial
        part of the materials necessary for such manufacture or production.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) This Convention does not apply to contracts in which the preponderant part of
        the obligations of the party who furnishes the goods consists in the supply of labour or
        other services.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 4</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>This Convention governs only the formation of the contract of sale and the
        rights and obligations of the seller and buyer arising from such a contract. In particular,
        except as otherwise expressly provided in this Convention, it is not concerned
        with:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) the validity of the contract or of any of its provisions or of any
          usage;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) the effect which the contract may have on the property in the goods
          sold.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 5</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>This Convention does not apply to the liability of the seller for death or
        personal injury caused by the goods to any person.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 6</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The parties may exclude the application of this Convention or, subject to
        article 12, derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Chapter II General Provisions</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 7</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its
        international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the
        observance of good faith in international trade.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not
        expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which
        it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by
        virtue of the rules of private international law.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 8</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) For the purpose of this Convention statements made by and other conduct of a
        party are to be interpreted according to his intent where the other party knew or could not
        have been unaware what that intent was.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the preceding paragraph is not applicable, statements made by and other
        conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to the understanding that a reasonable
        person of the same kind as the other party would have had in the same
        circumstances.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) In determining the intent of a party or the understanding a reasonable person
        would have had, due consideration is to be given to all relevant circumstances of the case
        including the negotiations, any practices which the parties have established between
        themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 9</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) The parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any
        practices which they have established between themselves.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The parties are considered, unless otherwise agreed, to have impliedly made
        applicable to their contract or its formation a usage of which the parties knew or ought to
        have known and which in international trade is widely known to, and regularly observed by,
        parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade concerned.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 10</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>For the purposes of this Convention:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that
          which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance, having regard to
          the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the
          conclusion of the contract;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to his
          habitual residence.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 11</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not
        subject to any other requirement as to form. It may be proved by any means, including
        witnesses.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 12</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Any provision of article 11, article 29 or Part II of this Convention that
        allows a contract of sale or its modifications or termination by agreement or any offer,
        acceptance or other indication of intention to be made in any form other than in writing
        does not apply where any party has his place of business in a Contracting State which has
        made a declaration under article 96 of this Convention. The parties may not derogate from or
        vary the effect of this article.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 13</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>For the purposes of this Convention "writing" includes telegram and
        telex.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Part II Formation of the Contract</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 14</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A proposal for concluding a contract addressed to one or more specific
        persons constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of
        the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. A proposal is sufficiently definite if it
        indicates the goods and expressly or implicitly fixes or makes provision for determining the
        quantity and the price.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) A proposal other than one addressed to one or more specific persons is to be
        considered merely as an invitation to make offers, unless the contrary is clearly indicated
        by the person making the proposal.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 15</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) An offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) An offer, even if it is irrevocable, may be withdrawn if the withdrawal
        reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 16</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) Until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revocation
        reaches the offeree before he has dispatched an acceptance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) However, an offer cannot be revoked:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) if it indicates, whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise,
          that it is irrevocable; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable
          and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 17</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>An offer, even if it is irrevocable, is terminated when a rejection reaches the
        offeror.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 18</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an
        offer is an acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to
        acceptance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) An acceptance of an offer becomes effective at the moment the indication of
        assent reaches the offeror. An acceptance is not effective if the indication of assent does
        not reach the offeror within the time he has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a
        reasonable time, due account being taken of the circumstances of the transaction, including
        the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. An oral offer must be
        accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) However, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the
        parties have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by
        performing an act, such as one relating to the dispatch of the goods or payment of the
        price, without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective at the moment the act is
        performed, provided that the act is performed within the period of time laid down in the
        preceding paragraph.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 19</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains
        additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a
        counter-offer.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains
        additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer
        constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to the
        discrepancy or dispatches a notice to that effect. If he does not so object, the terms of
        the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the
        acceptance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) Additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price,
        payment, quality and quantity of the goods, place and time of delivery, extent of one
        party's liability to the other or the settlement of disputes are considered to alter the
        terms of the offer materially.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 20</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror in a telegram or a
        letter begins to run from the moment the telegram is handed in for dispatch or from the date
        shown on the letter or, if no such date is shown, from the date shown on the envelope. A
        period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror by telephone, telex or other means of
        instantaneous communication, begins to run from the moment that the offer reaches the
        offeree.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) Official holidays or non-business days occurring during the period for
        acceptance are included in calculating the period. However, if a notice of acceptance cannot
        be delivered at the address of the offeror on the last day of the period because that day
        falls on an official holiday or a non-business day at the place of business of the offeror,
        the period is extended until the first business day which follows.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 21</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without delay
        the offeror orally so informs the offeree or dispatches a notice to that
        effect.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If a letter or other writing containing a late acceptance shows that it has
        been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have
        reached the offeror in due time, the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless,
        without delay, the offeror orally informs the offeree that he considers his offer as having
        lapsed or dispatches a notice to that effect.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 22</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>An acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or
        at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 23</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A contract is concluded at the moment when an acceptance of an offer becomes
        effective in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 24</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>For the purposes of this Part of the Convention, an offer, declaration of
        acceptance or any other indication of intention "reaches" the addressee when it is made
        orally to him or delivered by any other means to him personally, to his place of business or
        mailing address or, if he does not have a place of business or mailing address, to his
        habitual residence.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Part III Sale of Goods</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Chapter I General Provisions</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 25</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A breach of contract committed by one of the parties is fundamental if it
        results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is
        entitled to expect under the contract, unless the party in breach did not foresee and a
        reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances would not have foreseen such a
        result.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 26</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A declaration of avoidance of the contract is effective only if made by notice
        to the other party.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 27</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Part of the Convention, if any
        notice, request or other communication is given or made by a party in accordance with this
        Part and by means appropriate in the circumstances, a delay or error in the transmission of
        the communication or its failure to arrive does not deprive that party of the right to rely
        on the communication.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 28</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, one party is entitled
        to require performance of any obligation by the other party, a court is not bound to enter a
        judgement for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law in respect
        of similar contracts of sale not governed by this Convention.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 29</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the
        parties.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) A contract in writing which contains a provision requiring any modification
        or termination by agreement to be in writing may not be otherwise modified or terminated by
        agreement. However, a party may be precluded by his conduct from asserting such a provision
        to the extent that the other party has relied on that conduct.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Chapter II Obligations of the Seller</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 30</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The seller must deliver the goods, hand over any documents relating to them and
        transfer the property in the goods, as required by the contract and this
        Convention.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Section I Delivery of the goods and handing over of documents</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 31</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If the seller is not bound to deliver the goods at any other particular place,

      <bcl:indent2>(a) if the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods — in handing the goods

      <bcl:indent2>(b) if, in cases not within the preceding subparagraph, the contract relates to
          specific goods, or unidentified goods to be drawn from a specific stock or to be
          manufactured or produced, and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the parties
          knew that the goods were at, or were to be manufactured or produced at, a particular
          place — in placing the goods at the buyer's disposal at that place;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(c) in other cases — in placing the goods at the buyer's disposal at the place where
          the seller had his place of business at the time of the conclusion of the

      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the seller, in accordance with the contract or this Convention, hands the
        goods over to a carrier and if the goods are not clearly identified to the contract by
        markings on the goods, by shipping documents or otherwise, the seller must give the buyer
        notice of the consignment specifying the goods.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the seller is bound to arrange for carriage of the goods, he must make
        such contracts as are necessary for carriage to the place fixed by means of transportation
        appropriate in the circumstances and according to the usual terms for such
        transportation.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) If the seller is not bound to effect insurance in respect of the carriage of
        the goods, he must, at the buyer's request, provide him with all available information

      <bcl:indent2>(b) if a period of time is fixed by or determinable from the contract, at any time
          within that period unless circumstances indicate that the buyer is to choose a date;

      <bcl:lefttext>If the seller is bound to hand over documents relating to the goods, he must

        unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense. However, the buyer retains any right to
        claim damages as provided for in this Convention.</bcl:lefttext>

        required by the contract.</bcl:indent1>

          be used;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) are fit for any particular purpose expressly or impliedly made known to the
          seller at the time of the conclusion of the contract, except where the circumstances

      <bcl:indent1>(1) The seller is liable in accordance with the contract and this Convention for
        any lack of conformity which exists at the time when the risk passes to the buyer, even
        though the lack of conformity becomes apparent only after that time.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The seller is also liable for any lack of conformity which occurs after the
        time indicated in the preceding paragraph and which is due to a breach of any of his
        obligations, including a breach of any guarantee that for a period of time the goods will
        remain fit for their ordinary purpose or for some particular purpose or will retain
        specified qualities or characteristics.</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:indent1>(3) If the goods are redirected in transit or redispatched by the buyer without a
        reasonable opportunity for examination by him and at the time of the conclusion of the
        contract the seller knew or ought to have known of the possibility of such redirection or
        redispatch, examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at the new

      <bcl:indent1>(2) In any event, the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of
        the goods if he does not give the seller notice thereof at the latest within a period of two
        years from the date on which the goods were actually handed over to the buyer, unless this
        time-limit is inconsistent with a contractual period of guarantee.</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:lefttext>The seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third
        party, unless the buyer agreed to take the goods subject to that right or claim. However, if
        such right or claim is based on industrial property or other intellectual property, the
        seller's obligation is governed by article 42.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 42</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) The seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a
        third party based on industrial property or other intellectual property, of which at the
        time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew or could not have been unaware,
        provided that the right or claim is based on industrial property or other intellectual
        property:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) under the law of the State where the goods will be resold or otherwise used, if
          it was contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract that
          the goods would be resold or otherwise used in that State; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) in any other case, under the law of the State where the buyer has his place of
          business.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The obligation of the seller under the preceding paragraph does not extend to
        cases where:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) at the time of the conclusion of the contract the buyer knew or could not have
          been unaware of the right or claim; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) the right or claim results from the seller's compliance with technical drawings,

        <in:strong>Article 43</in:strong>

        aware of the right or claim.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The seller is not entitled to rely on the provisions of the preceding

        <in:strong>Article 45</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the seller fails to perform any of his obligations under the contract or
        this Convention, the buyer may:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) exercise the rights provided in articles 46 to 52;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) claim damages as provided in articles 74 to 77.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The buyer is not deprived of any right he may have to claim damages by
        exercising his right to other remedies.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) No period of grace may be granted to the seller by a court or arbitral
        tribunal when the buyer resorts to a remedy for breach of contract.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 46</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) The buyer may require performance by the seller of his obligations unless the
        buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the goods do not conform with the contract, the buyer may require delivery
        of substitute goods only if the lack of conformity constitutes a fundamental breach of
        contract and a request for substitute goods is made either in conjunction with notice given
        under article 39 or within a reasonable time thereafter.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) If the goods do not conform with the contract, the buyer may require the
        seller to remedy the lack of conformity by repair, unless this is unreasonable having regard
        to all the circumstances. A request for repair must be made either in conjunction with
        notice given under article 39 or within a reasonable time thereafter.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 47</in:strong>

      <bcl:indent1>(1) The buyer may fix an additional period of time of reasonable length for
        performance by the seller of his obligations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) Unless the buyer has received notice from the seller that he will not perform
        within the period so fixed, the buyer may not, during that period, resort to any remedy for
        breach of contract. However, the buyer is not deprived thereby of any right he may have to
        claim damages for delay in performance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 48</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) Subject to article 49, the seller may, even after the date for delivery,
        remedy at his own expense any failure to perform his obligations, if he can do so without
        unreasonable delay and without causing the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or uncertainty
        of reimbursement by the seller of expenses advanced by the buyer. However, the buyer retains
        any right to claim damages as provided for in this Convention.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the seller requests the buyer to make known whether he will accept
        performance and the buyer does not comply with the request within a reasonable time, the
        seller may perform within the time indicated in his request. The buyer may not, during that
        period of time, resort to any remedy which is inconsistent with performance by the
        seller.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) A notice by the seller that he will perform within a specified period of time
        is assumed to include a request, under the preceding paragraph, that the buyer make known
        his decision.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(4) A request or notice by the seller under paragraph (2) or (3) of this article
        is not effective unless received by the buyer.</bcl:indent1>

        <in:strong>Article 49</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) The buyer may declare the contract avoided:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) if the failure by the seller to perform any of his obligations under the
          contract or this Convention amounts to a fundamental breach of contract; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) in case of non-delivery, if the seller does not deliver the goods within the
          additional period of time fixed by the buyer in accordance with paragraph (1) of
          article 47 or declares that he will not deliver within the period so fixed.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) However, in cases where the seller has delivered the goods, the buyer loses
        the right to declare the contract avoided unless he does so:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) in respect of late delivery, within a reasonable time after he has become aware
          that delivery has been made;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) in respect of any breach other than late delivery, within a reasonable
          time:</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent3>(i) after he knew or ought to have known of the breach;</bcl:indent3>
      <bcl:indent3>(ii) after the expiration of any additional period of time fixed by the buyer in
          accordance with paragraph (1) of article 47, or after the seller has declared that he
          will not perform his obligations within such an additional period; or</bcl:indent3>
      <bcl:indent3>(iii) after the expiration of any additional period of time indicated by the seller
          in accordance with paragraph (2) of article 48, or after the buyer has declared that
          he will not accept performance.</bcl:indent3>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 50</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If the goods do not conform with the contract and whether or not the price has
        already been paid, the buyer may reduce the price in the same proportion as the value that
        the goods actually delivered had at the time of the delivery bears to the value that
        conforming goods would have had at that time. However, if the seller remedies any failure to
        perform his obligations in accordance with article 37 or article 48 or if the buyer refuses
        to accept performance by the seller in accordance with those articles, the buyer may not
        reduce the price.</bcl:lefttext>

        <in:strong>Article 51</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the seller delivers only a part of the goods or if only a part of the
        goods delivered is in conformity with the contract, articles 46 to 50 apply in respect of
        the part which is missing or which does not conform.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The buyer may declare the contract avoided in its entirety only if the
        failure to make delivery completely or in conformity with the contract amounts to a
        fundamental breach of the contract.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 52</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the seller delivers the goods before the date fixed, the buyer may take
        delivery or refuse to take delivery.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the seller delivers a quantity of goods greater than that provided for in
        the contract, the buyer may take delivery or refuse to take delivery of the excess quantity.
        If the buyer takes delivery of all or part of the excess quantity, he must pay for it at the
        contract rate.</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:indent2>(b) if the payment is to be made against the handing over of the goods or of
          documents, at the place where the handing over takes place.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The seller must bear any increase in the expenses incidental to payment which
        is caused by a change in his place of business subsequent to the conclusion of the

      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the buyer fails to perform any of his obligations under the contract or
        this Convention, the seller may:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) exercise the rights provided in articles 62 to 65;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) claim damages as provided in articles 74 to 77.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The seller is not deprived of any right he may have to claim damages by
        exercising his right to other remedies.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) No period of grace may be granted to the buyer by a court or arbitral
        tribunal when the seller resorts to a remedy for breach of contract.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 62</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The seller may require the buyer to pay the price, take delivery or perform his
        other obligations, unless the seller has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with
        this requirement.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 63</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) The seller may fix an additional period of time of reasonable length for
        performance by the buyer of his obligations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) Unless the seller has received notice from the buyer that he will not perform
        within the period so fixed, the seller may not, during that period, resort to any remedy for
        breach of contract. However, the seller is not deprived thereby of any right he may have to
        claim damages for delay in performance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 64</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) The seller may declare the contract avoided:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) if the failure by the buyer to perform any of his obligations under the contract
          or this Convention amounts to a fundamental breach of contract; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) if the buyer does not, within the additional period of time fixed by the seller
          in accordance with paragraph (1) of article 63, perform his obligation to pay the price
          or take delivery of the goods, or if he declares that he will not do so within the
          period so fixed.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) However, in cases where the buyer has paid the price, the seller loses the
        right to declare the contract avoided unless he does so:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) in respect of late performance by the buyer, before the seller has become aware
          that performance has been rendered; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) in respect of any breach other than late performance by the buyer, within a
          reasonable time:</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent3>(i) after the seller knew or ought to have known of the breach; or</bcl:indent3>
      <bcl:indent3>(ii) after the expiration of any additional period of time fixed by the seller in
          accordance with paragraph (1) of article 63, or after the buyer has declared that he
          will not perform his obligations within such an additional period.</bcl:indent3>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 65</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If under the contract the buyer is to specify the form, measurement or other
        features of the goods and he fails to make such specification either on the date agreed upon
        or within a reasonable time after receipt of a request from the seller, the seller may,
        without prejudice to any other rights he may have, make the specification himself in
        accordance with the requirements of the buyer that may be known to him.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the seller makes the specification himself, he must inform the buyer of
        the details thereof and must fix a reasonable time within which the buyer may make a
        different specification. If, after receipt of such a communication, the buyer fails to do so
        within the time so fixed, the specification made by the seller is binding.</bcl:indent1>

        <in:strong>Chapter IV Passing of Risk</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 66</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Loss of or damage to the goods after the risk has passed to the buyer does not
        discharge him from his obligation to pay the price, unless the loss or damage is due to an
        act or omission of the seller.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 67</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods and the seller is not
        bound to hand them over at a particular place, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods
        are handed over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer in accordance with the
        contract of sale. If the seller is bound to hand the goods over to a carrier at a particular
        place, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are handed over to the carrier at
        that place. The fact that the seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the
        disposition of the goods does not affect the passage of the risk.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) Nevertheless, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly
        identified to the contract, whether by markings on the goods, by shipping documents, by
        notice given to the buyer or otherwise.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 68</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time
        of the conclusion of the contract. However, if the circumstances so indicate, the risk is
        assumed by the buyer from the time the goods were handed over to the carrier who issued the
        documents embodying the contract of carriage. Nevertheless, if at the time of the conclusion
        of the contract of sale the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost
        or damaged and did not disclose this to the buyer, the loss or damage is at the risk of the
        seller.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 69</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) In cases not within articles 67 and 68, the risk passes to the buyer when he
        takes over the goods or, if he does not do so in due time, from the time when the goods are
        placed at his disposal and he commits a breach of contract by failing to take
        delivery.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) However, if the buyer is bound to take over the goods at a place other than a
        place of business of the seller, the risk passes when delivery is due and the buyer is aware
        of the fact that the goods are placed at his disposal at that place.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) If the contract relates to goods not then identified, the goods are
        considered not to be placed at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified
        to the contract.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 70</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If the seller has committed a fundamental breach of contract, articles 67, 68
        and 69 do not impair the remedies available to the buyer on account of the
        breach.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Chapter V Provisions Common to the Obligations of the Seller and of the
          Buyer</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Section I Anticipatory breach and instalment contracts</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A party may suspend the performance of his obligations if, after the
        conclusion of the contract, it becomes apparent that the other party will not perform a
        substantial part of his obligations as a result of:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) a serious deficiency in his ability to perform or in his creditworthiness;
          or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) his conduct in preparing to perform or in performing the contract.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the seller has already dispatched the goods before the grounds described
        in the preceding paragraph become evident, he may prevent the handing over of the goods to
        the buyer even though the buyer holds a document which entitles him to obtain them. The
        present paragraph relates only to the rights in the goods as between the buyer and the
        seller.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) A party suspending performance, whether before or after dispatch of the
        goods, must immediately give notice of the suspension to the other party and must continue
        with performance if the other party provides adequate assurance of his
        performance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 72</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If prior to the date for performance of the contract it is clear that one of
        the parties will commit a fundamental breach of contract, the other party may declare the
        contract avoided.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If time allows, the party intending to declare the contract avoided must give
        reasonable notice to the other party in order to permit him to provide adequate assurance of
        his performance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) The requirements of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the other party
        has declared that he will not perform his obligations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 73</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) In the case of a contract for delivery of goods by instalments, if the
        failure of one party to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment
        constitutes a fundamental breach of contract with respect to that instalment, the other
        party may declare the contract avoided with respect to that instalment.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If one party's failure to perform any of his obligations in respect of any
        instalment gives the other party good grounds to conclude that a fundamental breach of
        contract will occur with respect to future instalments, he may declare the contract avoided
        for the future, provided that he does so within a reasonable time.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) A buyer who declares the contract avoided in respect of any delivery may, at
        the same time, declare it avoided in respect of deliveries already made or of future
        deliveries if, by reason of their interdependence, those deliveries could not be used for
        the purpose contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the
        contract.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Section II Damages</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 74</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Damages for breach of contract by one party consist of a sum equal to the loss,
        including loss of profit, suffered by the other party as a consequence of the breach. Such
        damages may not exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen
        at the time of the conclusion of the contract, in the light of the facts and matters of
        which he then knew or ought to have known, as a possible consequence of the breach of
        contract.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 75</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If the contract is avoided and if, in a reasonable manner and within a
        reasonable time after avoidance, the buyer has bought goods in replacement or the seller has
        resold the goods, the party claiming damages may recover the difference between the contract
        price and the price in the substitute transaction as well as any further damages recoverable
        under article 74.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 76</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the contract is avoided and there is a current price for the goods, the
        party claiming damages may, if he has not made a purchase or resale under article 75,
        recover the difference between the price fixed by the contract and the current price at the
        time of avoidance as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74. If, however,
        the party claiming damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods, the current
        price at the time of such taking over shall be applied instead of the current price at the
        time of avoidance.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the current price is the price
        prevailing at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made or, if there is no
        current price at that place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable
        substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the
        goods.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 77</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A party who relies on a breach of contract must take such measures as are
        reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate the loss, including loss of profit, resulting
        from the breach. If he fails to take such measures, the party in breach may claim a
        reduction in the damages in the amount by which the loss should have been
        mitigated.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Section III Interest</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 78</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If a party fails to pay the price or any other sum that is in arrears, the other
        party is entitled to interest on it, without prejudice to any claim for damages recoverable
        under article 74.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Section IV Exemptions</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 79</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he
        proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and that he could not
        reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the
        conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its
        consequences.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the party's failure is due to the failure by a third person whom he has
        engaged to perform the whole or a part of the contract, that party is exempt from liability
        only if:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the provisions of that
          paragraph were applied to him.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) The exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which
        the impediment exists.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(4) The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the
        impediment and its effect on his ability to perform. If the notice is not received by the
        other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to
        have known of the impediment, he is liable for damages resulting from such
        non-receipt.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(5) Nothing in this article prevents either party from exercising any right other
        than to claim damages under this Convention.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 80</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A party may not rely on a failure of the other party to perform, to the extent
        that such failure was caused by the first party's act or omission.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Section V Effects of avoidance</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 81</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) Avoidance of the contract releases both parties from their obligations under
        it, subject to any damages which may be due. Avoidance does not affect any provision of the
        contract for the settlement of disputes or any other provision of the contract governing the
        rights and obligations of the parties consequent upon the avoidance of the
        contract.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) A party who has performed the contract either wholly or in part may claim
        restitution from the other party of whatever the first party has supplied or paid under the
        contract. If both parties are bound to make restitution, they must do so
        concurrently.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 82</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) The buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the
        seller to deliver substitute goods if it is impossible for him to make restitution of the
        goods substantially in the condition in which he received them.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The preceding paragraph does not apply:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) if the impossibility of making restitution of the goods or of making restitution
          of the goods substantially in the condition in which the buyer received them is not due
          to his act or omission;</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) if the goods or part of the goods have perished or deteriorated as a result of
          the examination provided for in article 38; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(c) if the goods or part of the goods have been sold in the normal course of
          business or have been consumed or transformed by the buyer in the course of normal use
          before he discovered or ought to have discovered the lack of conformity.</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 83</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A buyer who has lost the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the
        seller to deliver substitute goods in accordance with article 82 retains all other remedies
        under the contract and this Convention.</bcl:lefttext>

        <in:strong>Article 84</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the seller is bound to refund the price, he must also pay interest on it,
        from the date on which the price was paid.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) The buyer must account to the seller for all benefits which he has derived
        from the goods or part of them:</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent2>(a) if he must make restitution of the goods or part of them; or</bcl:indent2>
      <bcl:indent2>(b) if it is impossible for him to make restitution of all or part of the goods or
          to make restitution of all or part of the goods substantially in the condition in which
          he received them, but he has nevertheless declared the contract avoided or required the
          seller to deliver substitute goods.</bcl:indent2>

      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 85</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If the buyer is in delay in taking delivery of the goods or, where payment of
        the price and delivery of the goods are to be made concurrently, if he fails to pay the
        price, and the seller is either in possession of the goods or otherwise able to control
        their disposition, the seller must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to
        preserve them. He is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable
        expenses by the buyer.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 86</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If the buyer has received the goods and intends to exercise any right under
        the contract or this Convention to reject them, he must take such steps to preserve them as
        are reasonable in the circumstances. He is entitled to retain them until he has been
        reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the seller.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If goods dispatched to the buyer have been placed at his disposal at their
        destination and he exercises the right to reject them, he must take possession of them on
        behalf of the seller, provided that this can be done without payment of the price and
        without unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense. This provision does not apply if
        the seller or a person authorized to take charge of the goods on his behalf is present at
        the destination. If the buyer takes possession of the goods under this paragraph, his rights
        and obligations are governed by the preceding paragraph.</bcl:indent1>

        <in:strong>Article 87</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A party who is bound to take steps to preserve the goods may deposit them in a
        warehouse of a third person at the expense of the other party provided that the expense
        incurred is not unreasonable.</bcl:lefttext>

        <in:strong>Article 88</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) A party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with article 85 or
        86 may sell them by any appropriate means if there has been an unreasonable delay by the
        other party in taking possession of the goods or in taking them back or in paying the price
        or the cost of preservation, provided that reasonable notice of the intention to sell has
        been given to the other party.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) If the goods are subject to rapid deterioration or their preservation would
        involve unreasonable expense, a party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with
        article 85 or 86 must take reasonable measures to sell them. To the extent possible he must
        give notice to the other party of his intention to sell.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) A party selling the goods has the right to retain out of the proceeds of sale
        an amount equal to the reasonable expenses of preserving the goods and of selling them. He
        must account to the other party for the balance.</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>Article 93</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) If a Contracting State has two or more territorial units in which, according
        to its constitution, different systems of law are applicable in relation to the matters
        dealt with in this Convention, it may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance,

        units or only to one or more of them, and may amend its declaration by submitting another
        declaration at any time.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) These declarations are to be notified to the depositary and are to state
        expressly the territorial units to which the Convention extends.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) If, by virtue of a declaration under this article, this Convention extends to
        one or more but not all of the territorial units of a Contracting State, and if the place of
        business of a party is located in that State, this place of business, for the purposes of
        this Convention, is considered not to be in a Contracting State, unless it is in a
        territorial unit to which the Convention extends.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(4) If a Contracting State makes no declaration under paragraph (1) of this
        article, the Convention is to extend to all territorial units of that State.</bcl:indent1>

        of business in those States. Such declarations may be made jointly or by reciprocal
        unilateral declarations.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) A Contracting State which has the same or closely related legal rules on
        matters governed by this Convention as one or more non-Contracting States may at any time

        the parties have their places of business in those States.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) If a State which is the object of a declaration under the preceding paragraph
        subsequently becomes a Contracting State, the declaration made will, as from the date on
        which the Convention enters into force in respect of the new Contracting State, have the
        effect of a declaration made under paragraph (1), provided that the new Contracting State
        joins in such declaration or makes a reciprocal unilateral declaration.</bcl:indent1>

      <bcl:lefttext>A Contracting State whose legislation requires contracts of sale to be concluded
        in or evidenced by writing may at any time make a declaration in accordance with article 12
        that any provision of article 11, article 29, or Part II of this Convention, that allows a
        contract of sale or its modification or termination by agreement or any offer, acceptance,
        or other indication of intention to be made in any form other than in writing, does not
        apply where any party has his place of business in that State.</bcl:lefttext>

        <in:strong>Article 97</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:indent1>(1) Declarations made under this Convention at the time of signature are subject
        to confirmation upon ratification, acceptance or approval.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(2) Declarations and confirmations of declarations are to be in writing and be
        formally notified to the depositary.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(3) A declaration takes effect simultaneously with the entry into force of this
        Convention in respect of the State concerned. However, a declaration of which the depositary
        receives formal notification after such entry into force takes effect on the first day of
        the month following the expiration of six months after the date of its receipt by the
        depositary. Reciprocal unilateral declarations under article 94 take effect on the first day
        of the month following the expiration of six months after the receipt of the latest
        declaration by the depositary.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(4) Any State which makes a declaration under this Convention may withdraw it at
        any time by a formal notification in writing addressed to the depositary. Such withdrawal is
        to take effect on the first day of the month following the expiration of six months after
        the date of the receipt of the notification by the depositary.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(5) A withdrawal of a declaration made under article 94 renders inoperative, as
        from the date on which the withdrawal takes effect, any reciprocal declaration made by
        another State under that article.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:centertext>

      <bcl:indent1>(2) When a State ratifies, accepts, approves or accedes to this Convention after

        State, subject to the provisions of paragraph (6) of this article, on the first day of the
        month following the expiration of twelve months after the date of the deposit of its
        instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.</bcl:indent1>

        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods done at The Hague on 1 July 1964 (1964 Hague
        Formation Convention) and the Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale
        of Goods done at The Hague on 1 July 1964 (1964 Hague Sale Convention) shall at the same
        time denounce, as the case may be, either or both the 1964 Hague Sales Convention and the
        1964 Hague Formation Convention by notifying the Government of the Netherlands to that
        effect.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(4) A State party to the 1964 Hague Sales Convention which ratifies, accepts,
        approves or accedes to the present Convention and declares or has declared under article 92
        that it will not be bound by Part II of this Convention shall at the time of ratification,

        acceptance, approval or accession denounce the 1964 Hague Formation Convention by notifying
        the Government of the Netherlands to that effect.</bcl:indent1>

        accessions in respect of this Convention by States parties to the 1964 Hague Formation
        Convention or to the 1964 Hague Sales Convention shall not be effective until such
        denunciations as may be required on the part of those States in respect of the latter two
        Conventions have themselves become effective. The depositary of this Convention shall
        consult with the Government of the Netherlands, as the depositary of the 1964 Conventions,
        so as to ensure necessary coordination in this respect.</bcl:indent1>
