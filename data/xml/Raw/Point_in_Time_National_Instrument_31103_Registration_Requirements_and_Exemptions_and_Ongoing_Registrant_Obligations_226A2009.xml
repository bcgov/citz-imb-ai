      <indent3>(ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the registrant's investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the market value of the investments (securities) that are short.</indent3>
      <indent3>(iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the shortfall in cash.</indent3>
