        <in:strong>CONVENTION ON THE LAW APPLICABLE TO TRUSTS AND ON THEIR RECOGNITION</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The States signatory to the present Convention,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Considering that the trust, as developed in courts of equity in common law
        jurisdictions and adopted with some modifications in other jurisdictions, is a unique legal
        institution,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Desiring to establish common provisions on the law applicable to trusts and to
        deal with the most important issues concerning the recognition of trusts,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect, and have agreed on the
        following provisions —</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>CHAPTER ONE — SCOPE</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 1</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>This Convention specifies the law applicable to trusts and governs their
        recognition.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 2</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>For the purposes of this Convention, the term "trust" refers to the legal
        relationships created — inter vivos or on death — by a person, the settlor, when assets have
        been placed under the control of a trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary or for a
        specified purpose.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A trust has the following characteristics —</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee's own
          estate;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of
          another person on behalf of the trustee;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) the trustee has the power and the duty, in respect of which he is accountable,
          to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in accordance with the terms of the trust and
          the special duties imposed on him by law.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>The reservation by the settlor of certain rights and powers, and the fact that
        the trustee may himself have rights as a beneficiary, are not necessarily inconsistent with
        the existence of a trust.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 3</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention applies only to trusts created voluntarily and evidenced in
        writing.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 4</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention does not apply to preliminary issues relating to the validity of
        wills or of other acts by virtue of which assets are transferred to the
        trustee.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 5</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention does not apply to the extent that the law specified by Chapter II
        does not provide for trusts or the category of trusts involved.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>CHAPTER II — APPLICABLE LAW</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 6</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A trustee shall be governed by the law chosen by the settlor. The choice must be
        express or be implied in the terms of the instrument creating or the writing evidencing the
        trust, interpreted, if necessary, in the light of the circumstances of the
        case.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Where the law chosen under the previous paragraph does not provide for trusts or
        the category of trust involved, the choice shall not be effective and the law specified in
        Article 7 shall apply.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 7</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Where no applicable law has been chosen, a trust shall be governed by the law
        with which it is most closely connected.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>In ascertaining the law with which a trust is most closely connected reference
        shall be made in particular to —</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) the place of administration of the trust designated by the settlor;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) the situs of the assets of the trust;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) the place of residence or business of the trustee;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) the objects of the trust and the places where they are to be
          fulfilled.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 8</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The law specified by Article 6 or 7 shall govern the validity of the trust, its
        construction, its effects, and the administration of the trust.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>In particular that law shall govern —</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) the appointment, resignation and removal of trustees, the capacity to act as a
          trustee, and the devolution of the office of trustee;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) the rights and duties of trustees among themselves;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) the right of trustees to delegate in whole or in part the discharge of their
          duties or the exercise of their powers;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) the power of trustees to administer or to dispose of trust assets, to create
          security interests in the trust assets, or to acquire new assets;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(e) the powers of investment of trustees;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(f) restrictions on the duration of the trust, and on the power to accumulate the
          income of the trust;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(g) the relationships between the trustees and the beneficiaries including the
          personal liability of the trustees to the beneficiaries;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(h) the variation or termination of the trust;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(i) the distribution of the trust assets;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(j) the duty of trustees to account for their administration.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 9</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>In applying this Chapter, a severable aspect of the trust, particularly matters
        of administration, may be governed by a different law.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 10</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The law applicable to the validity of the trust shall determine whether that law
        or the law governing a severable aspect of the trust may be replaced by another
        law.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>CHAPTER III — RECOGNITION</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 11</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A trust created in accordance with the law specified by the preceding Chapter
        shall be recognized as a trust.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Such recognition shall imply as a minimum, that the trust property constitutes a
        separate fund, that the trustee may sue and be sued in his capacity as trustee, and that he
        may appear to act in this capacity before a notary or any person acting in an official
        capacity.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>In so far as the law applicable to the trust requires or provides, such
        recognition shall imply, in particular —</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) that personal creditors of the trustee shall have no recourse against the trust
          assets;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) that the trust assets shall not form part of the trustee's estate on his
          insolvency or bankruptcy;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) that the trust assets shall not form part of the matrimonial property of the
          trustee or his spouse nor part of the trustee's estate on his death;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) that the trust assets may be recovered when the trustee, in breach of trust, has
          mingled trust assets with his own property or has alienated trust assets. However, the
          rights and obligations of any third party holder of the assets shall remain subject to
          the law determined by the choice of law rules of the forum.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 12</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Where the trustee desires to register assets, movable or immovable, or documents
        of title to them, he shall be entitled, in so far as this is not prohibited by or
        inconsistent with the law of the State where registration is sought, to do so in his
        capacity as trustee or in such other way that the existence of the trust is
        disclosed.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 13</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>No State shall be bound to recognize a trust the significant elements of which,
        except for the choice of the applicable law, the place of administration and the habitual
        residence of the trustee, are more closely connected with States which do not have the
        institution of the trust or the category of trust involved.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 14</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention shall not prevent the application of rules of law more favourable
        to the recognition of trusts.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:centertext>
        <in:strong>CHAPTER IV — GENERAL CLAUSES</in:strong>
      </bcl:centertext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 15</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention does not prevent the application of provisions of the law
        designated by the conflicts rules of the forum, in so far as those provisions cannot be
        derogated from by voluntary act, relating in particular to the following matters
        —</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>(a) the protection of minors and incapable parties;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(b) the personal and proprietary effects of marriage;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(c) succession rights, testate and intestate, especially the indefeasible shares of
          spouses and relatives;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(d) the transfer of title to property and security interests in property;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(e) the protection of creditors in matters of insolvency;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>(f) the protection, in other respects, of third parties acting in good
          faith.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>If recognition of a trust is prevented by application of the preceding
        paragraph, the court shall try to give effect to the objects of the trust by other
        means.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 16</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention does not prevent the application of those provisions of the law
        of the forum which must be applied even to international situations, irrespective of rules
        of conflict of laws.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If another State has a sufficiently close connection with a case then, in
        exceptional circumstances, effect may also be given to rules of that state which have the
        same character as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Any Contracting State may, by way of
        reservation, declare that it will not apply the second paragraph of this
        article.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 17</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>In the Convention the word 'law' means the rules of law in force in a State
        other than its rules of conflict of laws.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 18</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The provisions of the Convention may be disregarded when their application would
        be manifestly incompatible with public policy <in:em>(ordre public)</in:em>.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 19</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Nothing in the Convention shall prejudice the powers of States in fiscal
        matters.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 20</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Any Contracting State may, at any time, declare that the provisions of the
        Convention will be extended to trusts declared by judicial decisions. This declaration shall
        be notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and will
        come into effect on the day when this notification is received.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Article 31 is applicable to the withdrawal of this declaration in the same way
        as it applies to a denunciation of the Convention.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 21</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Any Contracting State may reserve the right to apply the provisions of Chapter
        III only to trusts the validity of which is governed by the law of a Contracting
        State.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 22</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention applies to trusts regardless of the date on which they were
        created.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>However, a Contracting State may reserve the right not to apply the Convention
        to trusts created before the date on which, in relation to that State, the Convention enters
        into force.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 23</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>For the purposes of identifying the law applicable under the Convention, where a
        State comprises several territorial units each of which has its own rules of law in respect
        of trusts, any reference to the law of that State to be construed as referring to the law in
        force in the territorial unit in question.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 24</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in
        respect of trusts is not bound to apply the Convention to conflicts solely between the laws
        of such units.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Article 25</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The Convention shall not affect any other international instrument containing
        provisions on matters governed by this Convention to which a Contracting State is, or
        becomes, a Party.</bcl:lefttext>

      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or
        accession, or at the time of making a declaration in terms of Article 29, make the
        reservations provided for in Articles 16, 21 and 22.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>No other reservation shall be permitted.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>Any Contracting State may at any time withdraw a reservation which it has made;
        the reservation shall cease to have effect on the first day of the third calendar month
        after notification of the withdrawal.</bcl:lefttext>

        accordance with Article 30, paragraph 1.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>The instrument of accession shall be deposited with the Ministry of Foreign
        Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</bcl:lefttext>

        accession in the twelve months after the receipt of the notification referred to in

        ratify, accept or approve the Convention after an accession. Any such objection shall be
        notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the
        Netherlands.</bcl:lefttext>

        Convention applies.</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>If a State makes no declaration under this article, the Convention is to extend

      <bcl:lefttext>Thereafter the Convention shall enter into force —</bcl:lefttext>
