      <bcl:lefttext>We, the undersigned owner/owners (the "Owner") of the property identified in
        the application (the "Property") and the undersigned spouse (the "Spouse") of the/an
        Owner, acknowledge that:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>• the Owner made an agreement (the "Deferment Agreement") under the <in:doc>Land Tax
        Deferment Act</in:doc> (the "Act"), with Her Majesty the Queen in right of
        British Columbia (the "Province"), as represented by the minister responsible for the
        administration of the Act, permitting the Owner to defer property taxes on the
        Property;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• the Deferment Agreement has been deposited at the Tax Deferment Office and
        bears Agreement Number ....................., as assigned to it by the
        Province;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• the Spouse is married to the Owner, .........................<in:em>[name of
        applicable owner]</in:em>, or is living with that Owner in a marriage-like relationship, and has been living in that relationship for a continuous period of at least 2 years;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• the Spouse has read both the entire Deferment Agreement and the most recent
        statement of account setting out the amount outstanding under it;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• we have requested the minister responsible for the administration of the Act
        to enter into this Amending Agreement and wish to amend the Deferment Agreement to add the
        Spouse as a party to it.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>Therefore, we agree with the Province as follows:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>• The Deferment Agreement is amended to add the Spouse as a signatory to it, by
        adding the name of the Spouse in one of the spaces provided for an owner's
        name.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• The Spouse agrees to be bound by and to perform, satisfy and discharge all of
        the obligations, liabilities and duties under the Deferment Agreement, as hereby amended,
        as if he/she were an original signatory to it. Without limiting the generality of the
        foregoing, the Spouse, together with the Owner, shall be liable for all taxes, interest,
        administration fees and charges that, at any time prior to the time at which this Amending
        Agreement takes effect, have been or may be deferred under the Deferment
        Agreement.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• This Amending Agreement shall be read together with the Deferment Agreement,
        and we confirm that, except as modified by this Amending Agreement, all covenants, terms
        and conditions in the Deferment Agreement shall remain unchanged, unmodified and in full
        force and effect.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• This Amending Agreement will take effect when a transfer, to the Spouse, of a
        portion of the interest of the Owner, ........................................<in:em>[name
          of applicable owner]</in:em>, is registered in the land title office or given effect by
        the filing of a notice of transfer under the <in:doc>Manufactured Home Act</in:doc>.</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:lefttext>We authorize the Province to:</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:indent1>• obtain the Parcel Identifier (PID) Number(s), registered owner information
        and legal description of the Property, or the details of the manufactured home that
        correspond with the Property and to endorse that information on this Amending Agreement
        with the intent that the endorsement will form part of this Amending Agreement, and, in
        the case of the manufactured home, endorse the information on the financing change
        statement;</bcl:indent1>
      <bcl:indent1>• register this Amending Agreement as a modification to the registered charge
        created when the Deferment Agreement was registered in the land title office, or, in the
        case of a manufactured home, to register a financing change statement amending the
        financing statement registered at the Personal Property Registry when the Deferment
        Agreement was originally made.</bcl:indent1>
