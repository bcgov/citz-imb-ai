        <in:em>The General Assembly,</in:em>
      </bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Guided</in:em> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and good faith in the fulfilment of the obligations assumed by States in accordance with the Charter,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Affirming</in:em> that indigenous peoples are equal to all other peoples, while recognizing the right of all peoples to be different, to consider themselves different, and to be respected as such,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Affirming also</in:em> that all peoples contribute to the diversity and richness of civilizations and cultures, which constitute the common heritage of humankind,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Affirming further</in:em> that all doctrines, policies and practices based on or advocating superiority of peoples or individuals on the basis of national origin or racial, religious, ethnic or cultural differences are racist, scientifically false, legally invalid, morally condemnable and socially unjust,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Reaffirming</in:em> that indigenous peoples, in the exercise of their rights, should be free from discrimination of any kind,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Concerned</in:em> that indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices as a result of, inter alia, their colonization and dispossession of their lands, territories and resources, thus preventing them from exercising, in particular, their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Recognizing</in:em> the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies, especially their rights to their lands, territories and resources,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Recognizing also</in:em> the urgent need to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Welcoming</in:em> the fact that indigenous peoples are organizing themselves for political, economic, social and cultural enhancement and in order to bring to an end all forms of discrimination and oppression wherever they occur,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Convinced</in:em> that control by indigenous peoples over developments affecting them and their lands, territories and resources will enable them to maintain and strengthen their institutions, cultures and traditions, and to promote their development in accordance with their aspirations and needs,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Recognizing</in:em> that respect for indigenous knowledge, cultures and traditional practices contributes to sustainable and equitable development and proper management of the environment,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Emphasizing</in:em> the contribution of the demilitarization of the lands and territories of indigenous peoples to peace, economic and social progress and development, understanding and friendly relations among nations and peoples of the world,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Recognizing in particular</in:em> the right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing, training, education and well-being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Considering</in:em> that the rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Considering also</in:em> that treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements, and the relationship they represent, are the basis for a strengthened partnership between indigenous peoples and States,</bcl:lefttext>
      <bcl:lefttext>
        <in:em>Acknowledging</in:em> that the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights<in:footnoteref>2</in:footnoteref> and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,<in:footnoteref>2</in:footnoteref> as well as the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,<in:footnoteref>3</in:footnoteref> affirm the fundamental importance of the right to self-determination of all peoples, by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development,</bcl:lefttext>
