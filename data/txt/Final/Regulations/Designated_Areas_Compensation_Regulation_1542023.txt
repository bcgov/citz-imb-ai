timber harvesting under the cutting permits or timber sale licences was completed not more than 5 years before the year of the compensable period to which the net income amount relates;






(d)


the volume of timber harvested under the cutting permits or timber sale licences is sufficient to accurately indicate the net income amounts that would have been earned, and the established practices that would have been carried out, in relation to the harvested timber for which the holder is being compensated.
