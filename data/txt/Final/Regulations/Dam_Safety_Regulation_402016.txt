In this Schedule:


"category"
, in relation to consequences of failure, means one of the following:




(a)

loss of life;




(b)

environmental and cultural values;




(c)

infrastructure and economics;



"consequences of failure"

means losses or damages that are caused by a failure of a dam;


"failure"
, in relation to a dam, means an uncontrolled release of all or part
of the water impounded by the dam, whether or not caused by a collapse
of the dam.






Determination of classification




2

(1)


For the purposes of this regulation, the classification of a dam is to
be determined in accordance with the following steps:




(a)

for each category of consequences of failure in columns 3, 4 and 5 of
the table, identify the losses or damages specified in the applicable
column that most closely describe the losses or damages that are the
most severe potential consequences of a failure of the dam;




(b)

identify the dam failure consequences classification that is specified
in column 1 of the table for the losses or damages referred to in
paragraph (a) for each category;




(c)

the dam failure consequences classification identified under paragraph
(b) with the most severe potential consequences is the classification
of the dam.




(2)

For the purposes of identifying the consequences of failure in column
3 of the table, the descriptions in column 2 of the table of the
population of individuals that may be at risk if there were a failure
of the dam are to be considered.
