Recovery of costs by health authorities





2

of the Act, the health officer or health authority may recover reasonable costs from the person who was subject to the original order by filing in the Supreme Court a certificate in the form set out as Form 1 of the Schedule.

A certificate may be served personally on, or by registered mail sent to the last known address of, the person who was subject to the original order.






(3)


If a certificate is sent by registered mail, the certificate is deemed to be served on the person to whom it is addressed on the 14th day after deposit with Canada Post unless the person received actual service before that day.

On receiving a certificate, the person who was subject to the original order may request the Supreme Court to review the amount owing by filing an application in accordance with the Supreme Court Civil Rules.

(ii)


if, in the opinion of a medical health officer, delivery to each person would be impractical in the circumstances or would be likely to cause a delay that could significantly increase the risk to the health of any person, by both delivering the notice by any communications media and posting the order at the location where it is most likely to be brought to the attention of the members of the class.

(c)


the confirmation is received by the person who served the order or notice, or a person acting on that person's behalf, no later than 96 hours after the electronic message was sent.






(4)


Subsection (3) (c) does not apply if the person who is the subject of the order confirms, in writing, after the expiry of the 96 hour period that the order

of the Act.






(2)


The request must be made in writing to the medical health officer who issued the order, stating the reasons why the order should be reassessed.






(3)


Within 72 hours of receiving a request for reassessment, a medical health officer must consider whether the order is, or conditions within the order are, no longer necessary to protect public health.






(4)


On reassessment, a medical health officer must take into account any comments made






(a)


by a person specified in the order under section 29 (2) (c) to (f) of the Act, and






(b)


respecting the clinical condition of the person affected by the order, by a health care professional having the supervision or care of that person.
