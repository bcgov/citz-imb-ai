(4)


A validation body may validate a project plan only in a manner consistent with ISO 14064-3 and in accordance with the Act and this regulation.

Conflict of interest — validation bodies





16



(1)


Subject to subsection (2), a validation body, must, before performing a validation under section 15, ensure that it is free of or has in place procedures to mitigate any potential threat to independence in relation to the validation.






(2)


A validation body that is not free of any potential threat to independence in relation to a project may validate the project plan if, before making the validation, it establishes and documents procedures for mitigating any threat to independence, and during the validation process follows those procedures, such that a reasonable person would conclude that the potential for the threat to independence to influence the objectivity of the validation is insignificant.






(3)


Before providing a validation statement under section 15 (5), a validation body must prepare a report that






(a)


includes






(i)


a description of an assessment of threats to independence in relation to the project plan,






(ii)


if applicable, procedures for mitigating threats to independence, and






(iii)


if applicable, a report on implementation of the procedures referred to in subparagraph (ii), and

the validation body avoided any actual or potential conflicts of interest with the project proponent and with any person it is reasonable to expect may rely on the validation statement, and






(ii)


no person involved in the validation was involved in the development of the project plan.

Verification of project reports





21



(1)


Subject to subsections (3) to (5), a verification body may verify a project report and provide a verification statement in accordance with subsection (5) only if the verification body is satisfied that






(a)


the assertions in the project report respecting the project reduction are fair and reasonable,






(b)


there were no substantial changes in how the project was carried out during the project report period as compared to the description of that project in the project plan, and

For the purposes of subsection (1), the project proponent must






(a)


exercise due diligence in order to minimize the potential for qualifications,






(b)


provide a verification body retained by the project proponent with full and timely access to all records relevant to the verification, and






(c)


if necessary and consistent with this regulation, make such revisions to the project report as are needed to minimize or eliminate qualifications.

A verification body may not provide a verification statement under subsection (1) if the verification body considers that the project report is subject to material errors, omissions or misrepresentations.






(4)


For the purposes of subsection (3), a project report is subject to material errors, omissions or misrepresentations if






(a)


the aggregate or individual effects of errors, omissions or misrepresentations related to the project report make it probable that a verification body acting reasonably would not verify the project report,






(b)


the aggregate or individual effects of errors, omissions or misrepresentations related to the project report make it probable that the director, if informed of the errors, omissions or misrepresentations and acting reasonably, would not rely on the verification, or






(c)


the errors, omissions or misrepresentations are material as determined in accordance with the applicable protocol.






(5)


A verification body may verify a project report only in a manner consistent with ISO 14064-3 and in accordance with this regulation.

A verification under subsection (1) is made when a member of the verification body signs a verification statement that includes all of the following:






(a)


the name, address and other contact information for the verification body;






(b)


the date of the verification statement;






(c)


the title of the project;

22



(1)


Subject to subsection (2), a verification body must, before performing a verification under section 21, ensure that it is free of or has in place procedures to mitigate any potential threat to independence in relation to the verification.






(2)


A verification body that is not free of any potential threat to independence in relation to a project may verify a project report if, before making the verification, it establishes and documents procedures for mitigating any threat to independence, and during the verification follows those procedures, such that a reasonable person would conclude that the potential for a threat to independence is insignificant.






(3)


Before providing a verification statement under section 21 (6) in respect of a project report, a verification body must prepare a report that






(a)


includes






(i)


a description of an assessment of threats to independence in relation to the project report,






(ii)


if applicable, procedures for mitigating threats to independence, and






(iii)


if applicable, a report on implementation of the procedures referred to in subparagraph (ii), and






(b)


affirms that






(i)


the verification body avoided any actual or potential conflicts of interest with the project proponent and with any person it is reasonable to expect may rely on the verification statement, and






(ii)


no person involved in the verification was involved in the development of the project report.






(4)


A verification body that provides a verification statement must provide the report under subsection (3) with the verification statement.
