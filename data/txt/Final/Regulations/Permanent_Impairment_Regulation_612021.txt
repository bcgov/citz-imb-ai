Compensation for permanent impairment





3



The corporation must calculate and determine the permanent impairment compensation to which an insured is entitled under section 129

[permanent impairment compensation]

of the Act by






(a)


determining if the insured has sustained a catastrophic injury in accordance with section 2,






(b)


determining the insured's permanent impairment rating in accordance with section 4, and






(c)


determining the compensation that corresponds to, as applicable,






(i)


the catastrophic injury in accordance with section 8

[permanent impairment compensation calculation — catastrophic injury]

, or






(ii)


the permanent impairment rating in accordance with section 9

[permanent impairment compensation calculation — non-catastrophic injury]

.








Calculation of permanent impairment rating





4



The permanent impairment rating is the sum of






(a)


the permanent impairment component calculated and determined in accordance with section 5, and






(b)


one of the following:






(i)


the enhancement component calculated and determined in accordance with section 6

[enhancement component for symmetrical body parts]

;






(ii)


if no enhancement component is applicable, 0.








Calculation of permanent impairment component





5



(1)


To determine an insured's permanent impairment component, the corporation must take the following steps in the following order:






(a)


if the insured sustains a permanent impairment described in any of the following provisions, the corporation must calculate and determine the percentage that corresponds to the permanent impairment sustained by the insured in accordance with the Schedule:






(i)


a percentage in relation to section 13

[wrist and hand — amputation]

of the Schedule must be calculated and determined in accordance with that section;






(ii)


a percentage in relation to Division 3 of Part 3

[throat and related structures]

of the Schedule must be calculated and determined in accordance with section 100

[multiple impairments in Division added and multiplied by 0.7]

of the Schedule;






(iii)


a percentage in relation to item 7 of section 106

[other impairments to vision]

of the Schedule must be calculated and determined in accordance with section 107 of the Schedule;






(iv)


a percentage in relation to sections 149 to 152

[vestibulocochlear apparatus]

of the Schedule must be calculated and determined in accordance with section 148

[formula to determine percentage for sections 149 to 152]

of the Schedule;






(b)


if the insured sustains a permanent impairment not calculated and determined in accordance with paragraph (a), the corporation must calculate and determine the percentage that corresponds to the permanent impairment sustained by the insured in accordance with the Schedule;






(c)


if the insured sustains a permanent impairment that is not described in the Schedule, the corporation must calculate and determine a percentage for the permanent impairment using one or more permanent impairments described in the Schedule as a guide to establish a percentage for the permanent impairment not described in the Schedule.






(2)


If, under subsection (1), the corporation calculates and determines only one percentage in the Schedule is applicable to a permanent impairment sustained by the insured, the percentage corresponding to the permanent impairment is the permanent impairment component.






(3)


If an insured's permanent impairment component is determined by reference to more than one permanent impairment, the permanent impairment component must be determined using the following formula:





C = A + (B(1 − A))










where




A


=


(a)


for the first application of the formula, subject to subsection (4), the highest percentage corresponding to the permanent impairments sustained by the insured;








(b)


for any subsequent application of the formula, the value solved for as C in the previous calculation;




B


=


(a)


for the first application of the formula, subject to subsection (4), the second highest percentage corresponding to the permanent impairments sustained by the insured;








(b)


for any subsequent application of the formula, subject to subsection (4), the next highest percentage corresponding to the permanent impairments sustained by the insured;




C


=


(a)


subject to subsection (4), the value to be used as A in each subsequent application of the formula;








(b)


if the B variable is the lowest percentage corresponding to the permanent impairments sustained by the insured when applying the formula, the permanent impairment component.









(4)


If any of the following result in a fraction of a percentage, the fraction must be rounded to the nearest whole percentage and if a percentage ends in .5 it must be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage:






(a)


the percentage corresponding to a permanent impairment sustained by the insured;






(b)


the percentage determined in accordance with subsection (3) as the C variable in each subsequent application of the formula;






(c)


the permanent impairment component calculated and determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of variable C.








Enhancement component for symmetrical body parts





6



(1)


Subject to section 7, the enhancement component set out in subsection (2) is added to the permanent impairment component to determine the permanent impairment rating if an anatomicophysiological deficit resulting from the accident






(a)


impairs symmetrical body parts, or






(b)


impairs a body part that is symmetrical to a body part that was permanently impaired before the accident.






(2)


For the purposes of subsection (1), the enhancement component must be calculated using the following formula:





EC = A × 0.25










where




EC


=


the enhancement component;




A


=


subject to subsection (3), the percentage calculated and determined








(a)


by applying section 5 as if the percentage to be calculated and determined were the permanent impairment component, and








(b)


excluding all permanent impairments resulting from the accident except those permanent impairments that correspond to the most severely impaired symmetrical part of the insured's body.









(3)


For the purposes of variable A in subsection (2), the percentage of an anatomicophysiological deficit that existed before an accident must be calculated and determined in accordance with section 5 as if the deficit resulted from the accident.








Exceptions to section 6





7



The enhancement component determined in accordance with section 6 does not apply to any of the following anatomicophysiological deficits:






(a)


a deficit that affects an internal organ;






(b)


a deficit that affects an organ controlling vision, balance or hearing;






(c)


a deficit that results from an injury to the central nervous system;






(d)


a deficit that affects the teeth.








Permanent impairment compensation calculation — catastrophic injury





8



If the insured sustains a catastrophic injury, the permanent impairment compensation is $264 430.








Permanent impairment compensation calculation — non-catastrophic injury





9



(1)


Subject to subsection (2), the compensation for an insured's permanent impairment that is not a catastrophic injury must be calculated and determined using the following formula:





P = PIR × $167 465










where




P


=


permanent impairment compensation in dollars;




PIR


=


the insured's permanent impairment rating.









(2)


Despite subsection (1), if the permanent impairment compensation determined in accordance with subsection (1) is more than $0, the minimum compensation in relation to a permanent impairment is $836.








Compensation determined at time of accident





10



(1)


For the purposes of this section,

"permanent"

in relation to an impairment, means






(a)


following a period of time sufficient for optimal tissue repair, the impairment






(i)


has become static, or






(ii)


has stabilized, and






(b)


the impairment is unlikely to change significantly with further therapy.






(2)


The corporation must not pay the compensation under section 8 or 9 until the impairment is permanent.






(3)


The corporation must calculate and determine the compensation under section 8 or 9 as of the date of the accident.

Calculation and determination of percentage for other impairments to vision







107



(1)


The percentage that corresponds to a deficit for the entire visual system is the difference between the percentage of visual efficiency of binocular vision represented in variable C in subsection (2) and 100%.






(2)


If the insured sustains a permanent loss of visual efficiency, the percentage of efficiency of binocular vision is determined by the following formula:





3A


4


+


B


4


= C










where




A


=


the percentage of visual efficiency determined as variable G in the formula in subsection (3) in respect of the better eye;




B


=


the percentage of visual efficiency determined as variable G in the formula in subsection (3) for the other eye;




C


=


the percentage of visual efficiency of binocular vision.









(3)


For the purposes of variables A and B in the formula set out in subsection (2), the visual efficiency of each eye is determined in accordance with the following formula:





D × E × F = G










where




D


=


the percentage of visual acuity retained, calculated and determined in accordance with section 109

[central visual acuity — percentage for variable D]

;




E


=


the percentage of visual field retained, calculated and determined in accordance with section 112

[visual field — percentage for variable E]

;




F


=


the percentage of ocular motility retained, calculated and determined in accordance with section 114

[ocular motility — percentage for variable F]

;




G


=


the percentage of visual efficiency of the eye in the formula in subsection (1).

(2)


The test to plot the field of binocular single vision is conducted






(a)


using an arc perimeter, or






(b)


if an arc perimeter is not available, a tangent screen for evaluating the central 40°.






(3)


For the purposes of the test to plot the field of binocular single vision, the following apply in respect of the insured:






(a)


the insured must not wear spectacle corrective lenses, unless the corrective lenses are single vision and do not contain prisms;






(b)


the insured must not wear spectacles with progressive lenses;






(c)


the insured may wear contact lenses.






(4)


For the purposes of the test to plot the field of binocular single vision, the following apply in respect of the test:






(a)


the extent of diplopia in the various directions of gaze is determined on the arc perimeter at 33 cm;






(b)


examination is made in each of the 8 principal meridians by using






(i)


a small test light, or






(ii)


the projected light of approximately Goldmann III-4e;






(c)


the presence of diplopia must be plotted along the 8 principal meridians on a suitable visual field chart consistent with the diagram in section 114;






(d)


a field of binocular single vision must be plotted on a suitable visual field chart consistent with the diagram in section 114;






(e)


diplopia within 20° from the centre is considered to be a 100% impairment of ocular motility, in respect of the injured eye, and is shaded in grey in the diagram in section 114 entitled "percentage of deficit of ocular motility of an eye in the field of diplopia";






(f)


beyond 20° from the centre, the diagram in section 114 entitled "percentage of deficit of ocular motility of an eye in the field of diplopia" is used to determine the impairment percentage.








Ocular motility — percentage for variable F

Division 2 —


Disfigurement of Skin Overlaying Rest of Body







Disfigurement of skin, other than facial disfigurement







156



(1)


In this section:



"arms, shoulders and elbows"

means the skin overlaying the body region extending from the acromion process and axillary folds to the olecranon process and cubital fossa;



"forearms"

means the skin overlaying the body region beginning at the distal aspect of the elbow and extending to the wrist crease;



"lower limbs"

means the skin overlaying the distal aspect of the trunk and extending distally to the tips of the toes, including the buttocks;



"neck"

means the skin overlaying the body region C1 to C7 posteriorly and the cricoid cartilage to the sternal notch anteriorly;



"scalp and skull"

means the skin overlaying the skull beginning at the normal hairline in front and following the normal hairline around the side to the back;



"trunk"

includes the skin overlaying the scapulae, supraspinous fossa, supras-capular and supraclavicular fossa body region and extends distally to the anterior inguinal ligaments and the posterior iliac crests;



"wrists and hands"

means the skin overlaying the body region beginning at the wrist crease and extending distally to the fingertips.






(2)


If the insured sustains permanent disfigurement of the skin overlaying body regions other than the face, the percentage is determined, subject to subsection (3), as follows:






(a)


the percentage in column 3 corresponds to the insured's alteration in form and symmetry in column 2 described opposite the applicable body region in column 1;






(b)


the percentage in column 5 corresponds to the insured's scarring in column 4 described opposite the applicable body region in column 1;






(c)


if applicable, if the insured sustains an alteration in form and symmetry and scarring of a body region, the percentage is the higher of the percentages determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b).






(3)


The percentage determined in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) must not exceed the percentage set out in column 6 that corresponds to the body region opposite it in column 1.
