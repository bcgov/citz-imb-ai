(a)


affects land outside an established system of highways,






(b)


affects land having access only by air or water,






(c)


affects land where the only connection with the general highway system of the Province is by tram line, cable car, gondola lift or a forest service road established under the

If there is no connection with a highway

An approving officer may grant relief from compliance with section 75 (1) (a) (i) of the Act if a subdivision creates a single parcel that does not abut a highway and the subdivider






(a)


proposes to grant, appurtenant to the new parcel, an easement of access to a highway or, where there is no established system of highways, a private road or way, and






(b)


submits to the approving officer a subdivision plan that shows the new parcel and outlines in a manner that complies with the rules made by the Association of British Columbia Land Surveyors or, in the case of an electronic plan, that complies with Part 10.1 of the


Land Title Act

(ii)


the private road or way.


[en. B.C. Reg. 295/2006, s. 3; am. B.C. Reg. 171/2019, s. (c).]

(4)


The plan presented to the approving officer shall contain a table listing serially in the left column the lots referred to in subsection (1) (a), and opposite each of them in the right column the undivided share of the lot referred to in subsection (1) (b) that is to be combined with each of the lots listed in the left column.

(8)


An approving officer may require the subdivider to enter into one or more covenants registerable under section 219 of the Act with respect to the lot referred to in subsection (1) (b), and, in doing so, shall take into consideration whether that lot is to be used






(a)


solely as a private road, including a utility right of way, or






(b)


in a designated part as a private road, including a utility right of way, with the balance as a private park, garden, recreational area, parking or service area, or for another use having common benefit or utility to purchasers of parcels in the subdivision.






(9)


An approving officer may require the granting of a statutory right of way as defined in the Act over the lot referred to in subsection (1) (b) for municipal or public utility purposes.
