(d)


if applicable, the bonus bid offered in respect of the timber.

(3)


If an agreement or a cutting permit referred to in subsection (2) requires its holder to pay an amount determined in accordance with the agreement or the cutting permit for timber that is not cut and removed in accordance with the agreement or the cutting permit, the holder must pay the amount required to be paid under the agreement or the cutting permit.

after the stumpage rate was determined, redetermined or varied under section 105 (1), the minister became aware of information that

did not exist when the stumpage rate was determined, redetermined or varied;

must, in the circumstances provided for in the policies and procedures referred to in section 105 (1) (c),

(a)


for the designated area to which it relates, may be made effective on or after the date the designated area is specified under section 169 (1), and






(b)


may specify that portions of the reduction are attributable to different types of timber and terrain in different parts of Crown land within the designated area.






(3)


If the allowable annual cut of a timber supply area is reduced under subsection (2), the minister may distribute all or part of the reduction among the forest licences in the timber supply area in accordance with section 63 (2) and, for this purpose, section 63 (4) applies.






(3.1)


An allowable annual cut reduction under subsection (3) may be made effective on or after the date on which the chief forester's order to which it relates is made or is made effective.

[Repealed 2000-6-19.]








Effect of reduction on annual allowable cut determination





173.1



(1)


Neither a reduction in allowable annual cut under section 173 (2), nor a restoration of an allowable annual cut under section 173 (10), constitutes a determination of an allowable annual cut for the purposes of the time limits set out in section 8 (1) and (2).






(2)


Section 8 does not apply to a reduction of an allowable annual cut under section 173.






(3)


If an allowable annual cut of a timber supply area or tree farm licence area is reduced under section 173, the chief forester is not required to make an allowable annual cut determination under section 8 (1) in respect of those areas at the times set out in section 8 (1) or (2) (c) or (d), but must make that determination within 2 years after the designated area to which the reduction applies ceases to be a designated area.

this Act, the


Forest and Range Practices Act


, the


Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act


, the


Wildfire Act


or any regulations or standards made under those Acts,






(b)


an agreement, or
