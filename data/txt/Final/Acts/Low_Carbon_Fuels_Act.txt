Allocation agreements







7




(

1

)



Subject to subsection (2) and the regulations, a person may, in relation to fuel for which the person is responsible, enter into an agreement with another person that makes the other person responsible for the fuel.

(

2

)



If a person who is required to meet a renewable fuel target under section 9 exceeds the target, the person may







(

a

)



notionally retain an amount of the eligible renewable fuel that does not exceed the lesser of the excess and the prescribed portion of the target, and







(

b

)



apply that amount to the target for the next compliance period.







(

3

Transition — renewable fuel requirements







60





A notional transfer, a notional retention or a deferral under section 5



[transferring or retaining renewable fuel excess or deficiency]

)



A carbon intensity record prepared in accordance with the regulations under the former Act before this section comes into force is deemed to be a carbon intensity record under this Act.







(

4

)



A carbon intensity published under section 6 (5)



[low carbon fuel requirement]



of the former Act is deemed to be a published carbon intensity under this Act.







(

5

)



A person may, for the purpose of complying with section 6 (1)

of the former Act,

[low carbon fuel requirement]



of the former Act.










Transition — regulations
