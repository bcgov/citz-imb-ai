41



(1)


[Repealed 2012-28-4.]






(2)


In setting a price cap applicable to a route group, the commissioner must be guided by the following principles:

the portion of operating expenses, including all financing charges, that can reasonably be applied to the route group,






(ii)


the portion of administrative expenses that can reasonably be applied to the route group, and






(iii)


the reasonable capital costs that are to be






(A)


incurred in relation to the route group, and






(B)


amortized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a straight line basis;






(b)


the price cap, when combined with all other price caps applicable to all route groups serviced by the ferry operator, must allow for a return sufficient to enable the ferry operator to






(i)


meet its debt obligations, and






(ii)


maintain access to borrowing rates that, in the opinion of the commissioner, are reasonable in all of the circumstances;






(c)


the price cap must take into account the anticipated productivity gain determined under subsection (5);






(d)


the ferry operator is, on an ongoing basis, to actively seek additional or alternative service providers to provide ferry services on the designated ferry routes included in the route group in order to reduce the costs of providing those services.






(3)


For the purposes of subsection (2) (a) to (c), the commissioner must, in setting a price cap for a route group,

(c)


determine whether it was reasonable, in the commissioner's opinion, acting reasonably, for the ferry operator to have incurred capital expenses in relation to a designated ferry route included in the route group, and take into account only those capital expenses that






(i)


are determined under this paragraph to be reasonable, or






(ii)


had been approved under section 55,

means the expenses estimated by the commissioner for the fiscal year under section 59 (1).








Special levy for extraordinary expenses





61



(1)


At any time in a fiscal year, the commissioner may submit to the ferry operators and the government a request for a special levy to obtain money additional to that being provided for that fiscal year under section 60 if






(a)


the money is required to satisfy extraordinary expenses,






(b)


the extraordinary expenses were not provided for in the budget prepared under section 59 in respect of that fiscal year, and

(2)


The commissioner must not submit a levy request under subsection (1) more than once in any fiscal year.






(3)


Subject to subsection (4) and to section 62, if a levy request is made under subsection (1) in a fiscal year, each ferry operator must, at the beginning of each quarter of that fiscal year to follow the request, pay to the commissioner, in addition to the amount payable under section 60, the amount determined by the following formula:

Dispute resolution process





62



(1)


If a ferry operator considers that the expenses included by the commissioner in a budget or levy request for a fiscal year exceed the amount that is reasonably required to cover the expenses referred to in section 57 for that fiscal year, the ferry operator may require that the matter be referred to arbitration by delivering to the commissioner and the minister, within one month after receipt of the budget or levy request, as the case may be, a notice requiring that arbitration.






(2)


If a notice requiring arbitration is not provided by a ferry operator under subsection (1) within one month after receipt of a budget or levy request, as the case may be, the budget or levy request and the estimated expenses or extraordinary expenses, as the case may be, are deemed to have been agreed upon by the ferry operator and the commissioner.






(3)


If a ferry operator does not provide a notice under subsection (1) in respect of a budget or levy request, the ferry operator must make the payments required under section 60 or 61, as the case may be, in relation to that budget or levy request, whether or not any other ferry operator seeks arbitration in relation to the budget or levy request and whether or not, in any other arbitration under this section in relation to that budget or levy request, the arbitrator determines that the expenses estimated by the commissioner in the budget or levy request are greater than or are less than the amount that is reasonably required to cover the expenses referred to in section 57 for that fiscal year.






(4)


If a notice requiring arbitration is provided by a ferry operator under subsection (1) within one month after receipt of a budget or levy request, the


International Commercial Arbitration Act


applies to the dispute and, for that purpose,






(a)


the ferry operator and the commissioner are deemed to have agreed to arbitrate the dispute referred to in paragraph (b) as if the commissioner were the claimant and the ferry operator were the respondent, and are deemed for that purpose to have entered into an arbitration agreement within the meaning of section 7 of the


International Commercial Arbitration Act


,






(b)


the dispute that is deemed to be submitted to arbitration is whether the expenses sought by the budget or the expenses sought by the levy request, as the case may be, exceed the amount that is reasonably required to cover the expenses referred to in section 57 for that fiscal year,






(c)


any fees, costs, deposits and expenses payable in relation to the arbitration are to be borne by the ferry operator, and no costs or interest are to be awarded to either party, and






(d)


the arbitration must be an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, and if the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within 15 days after receipt by the commissioner of the notice requiring arbitration under subsection (1), or, in the case of an appointment required under section 15 of the


International Commercial Arbitration Act


, within 15 days after the termination of the mandate of the arbitrator to be replaced, the appointment must be made by the minister.






(5)


Even though a dispute as to the reasonableness of the commissioner's expenses sought by the budget, or the expenses sought by the levy request, as the case may be, has been referred to arbitration under subsection (1), the ferry operators must, subject to subsection (6), make the payments required under section 60 or 61, as the case may be.






(6)


If, as a result of an arbitration under subsection (1), the arbitrator determines that the expenses sought by the budget, or the expenses sought by the levy request, as the case may be, are greater than or are less than the amount that is reasonably required to cover the expenses referred to in section 57 for the applicable fiscal year, the ferry operators must, at the beginning of each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year, pay the amount determined by the following formula:





arbitrated expenses ×





operator's tariff revenue





− amounts paid









previous year's tariff revenue









remaining quarters








where





"arbitrated expenses"



means the amount that is determined by the arbitration to be reasonably required to cover the expenses referred to in section 57 for that fiscal year;





"amounts paid"



means the total of the amounts paid by the ferry operator under sections 60 and 61 in the fiscal year in respect of which the expenses are sought;





"remaining quarters"



means the number of quarters in the fiscal year for which no payments have been made under sections 60 and 61.











Expenditures





63



(1)


The first commissioner appointed under section 35 may, in the first fiscal year of the first commissioner, spend for the commissioner's expenses referred to in section 57 for that fiscal year, out of the consolidated revenue fund without an appropriation other than this section, an amount not greater than the amount that ferry operators are required to pay under section 58 for that fiscal year.






(2)


The commissioner must not, in any subsequent fiscal year, spend for the commissioner's expenses referred to in section 57 for that fiscal year an amount that exceeds the amount that ferry operators are required to pay under section 60, 61 or 62, as the case may be, for that fiscal year, unless the government has authorized that greater expenditure.
