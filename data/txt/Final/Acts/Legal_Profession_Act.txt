if an examination is to be held in Canada, to the Deputy Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia, or

(8)


This section does not limit any power the society may have to obtain evidence outside British Columbia by any other means.

(10)


Unless otherwise provided by this section, the practice and procedure for appointing a person, conducting an examination and certifying and returning the appointment under this section, as far as possible, is the same as the practice and procedure that govern similar matters in civil proceedings in the Supreme Court.
