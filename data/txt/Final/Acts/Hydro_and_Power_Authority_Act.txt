the authority requires.




(2)

If land is expropriated under subsection (1), the

Expropriation Act

applies.




(3)

If the authority exercises a power under subsection (1) that does not
constitute the expropriation of land requiring approval under the

Expropriation Act

, it must obtain the approval of the minister before the power is
exercised.




(4)

If the authority expropriates property under subsection (1) other than
land, the authority must notify the Attorney General and, if required
by the Attorney General, file a notice describing the property at a
place designated by the Attorney General.




(5)

Despite any other Act, the property referred to in subsection (3) that
is expropriated vests in the authority free and clear of all
encumbrances




(a)

when the notice is filed under subsection (4), or




(b)

if no filing is requested, when the Attorney General receives the
notification under subsection (4).




(6)

After property vests under subsection (5), the authority must serve on
the owner of the property a notice containing a description of the
property sufficient to identify it, together with a declaration of
readiness to pay compensation in an amount to be agreed on or to be
determined under subsection (9).




(7)

If an owner is absent from British Columbia or is unknown or cannot be
served, the Supreme Court may, on the application of the authority,
order that the notice under subsection (6) be published in a manner
and for a time that the court thinks proper, and, on publication, the
owner is deemed to have been served with the notice.




(8)

If the authority exercises its powers under subsection (1), other than
in relation to the expropriation of land, it must pay compensation for




(a)

the interest, property, matter or thing expropriated, entered on or
used, and




(b)

damages to any property that directly result from the expropriation,
entry or use.




(9)

If the authority and a person entitled to compensation fail to agree
on the amount of compensation payable under subsection (8), the amount
must be determined by the Supreme Court.






Compulsory supply of power




17

(1)


If the authority is unable to agree with a person required or
compelled to supply power under section 16 (1) (d) on the amount of
power available for the authority's use or the price to be paid for it
or on any matter relating to supplying the power desired, the
commission must, on application of either party, after a hearing,
determine the amount of power, if any, to be supplied and the price to
be paid for it, and also any other matter on which agreement has not
been reached.




(2)

A determination of the commission under subsection (1) is final.






Release on expropriation




18

(1)


If any power of expropriation is exercised by the authority, the
authority must, by order in writing, release the person whose property
has been expropriated from any obligation relating to the purchase or
supply of power or to the purchase or sale of anything required for a
power plant.




(2)

An order made under subsection (1) is binding on all parties
concerned.




(3)

An order made under subsection (1) has effect only in regard to
matters connected with the property expropriated.






Application of expropriation power




19


The power of expropriation conferred on the authority extends to
property, plants, rights, powers and privileges, even though




(a)

they are or may be deemed to be devoted to public use, or




(b)

the owner possesses the power of taking land compulsorily,


but the authority does not have the power to take by expropriation
land or a plant of a municipality that may be used for the generation
or supply of power.






Power of entry, etc.




20

(1)


The authority may, by itself, or by its engineers, surveyors, agents,
contractors, subcontractors or employees, for any purpose relating to
the use, construction, maintenance, safeguarding or repair of its
plants or projected plants, or for better access to them and without
the consent of the owner, enter any land and




(a)

survey and take levels of it and make the borings, tests or sink the
trial pits it thinks necessary,




(b)

cut down any trees that, in its opinion, might, in falling or

make or use all roads, trails, bridges, wharves and other works and
facilities, whether permanent or temporary, that may be required for
the convenient passing to and from its survey lines, plants and
projected plants.

for damage to crops, gardens, shrubs, trees or other growing things,
or other damage caused by or incidental to the exercise of powers
conferred by this section, if the amount of compensation for damage is
not agreed on, compensation must be determined by the Supreme Court.

places and at times and in a manner the authority determines.

The directors of the authority may, by resolution, delegate any of
their powers or the powers of the authority under this section to any
director or officer of the authority.




(3)

A resolution under this section that is approved by the required
number of directors by telephone or any other means of communication
and that is confirmed in writing or other graphic communication is as
valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the
directors properly called and constituted.




(4)

The notes, bonds, debentures and other securities of the authority may
be made redeemable in advance of maturity at times and at prices the
directors of the authority determine at the time of the issue.




(5)

For this section, the purposes of the authority, without limiting any
other provision of this Act, include the following:




(a)

payment, refunding, exchange or renewal of all or any part of a loan
raised or securities issued by the authority, except to the extent
that a sinking fund is available for the payment of the loan or
securities, and a recital or declaration in the resolution or minutes
of the authority authorizing the issue of securities as to the amount
of any sinking fund so available is conclusive evidence of the fact;

payment of all or any part of a loan, liability or bonds, debentures
or other securities, payment of which is guaranteed or assumed by the
authority;




(c)

payment of any other liability or indebtedness of the authority;

on the authority under this or any other Act or law.

that will realize the net sum required by the authority for its
purposes, and a recital or declaration in the resolution or minutes of
the authority authorizing the issue of securities to the effect that
the issue of the authorized securities is being made for the purposes
of the authority and that the amount is necessary to realize the net
sum required for the purposes of the authority is conclusive evidence
of the fact.




(7)

Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, on
terms and conditions thought advisable, the authority may dispose of
the notes, bonds, debentures and other securities of the authority,
either at the par value of them or at less or more than the par value,
and may charge, pledge, hypothecate, deposit or otherwise deal with
the securities as collateral security.

and conditions thought advisable, the authority may exchange notes,

may be treated by the authority as unissued and, subject to the
approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council,




(c)

may be issued, reissued, charged, pledged, hypothecated, deposited,
dealt with as collateral security, sold or otherwise disposed of on
terms and conditions the directors of the authority think advisable,
or




(d)

at the option of the authority, may be cancelled, at which time,
subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, fresh
securities to the same amount and in the same form may be issued in
place of them with the same consequences, and on the issue or reissue
a person entitled to them has the same rights and remedies as if the
securities had not been previously issued,


but the borrowing power of the authority is deemed not to have been
affected by the issuance, reissuance, pledging, depositing or selling
of securities under this section.

ceased to hold office before the date of the security or before its
issue.

Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, the
authority may also borrow by way of temporary loans from any person
the sums on the terms, for the purposes and on the conditions the
