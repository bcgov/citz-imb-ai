16



If the garnishee disputes his or her liability, a judge, instead of making an order for payment into court or otherwise, may order that any issue or question necessary for determining the liability of the garnishee be tried or determined in any manner in which an issue or question in any action may be tried or determined.








Judge may order appearance of third person





17



If, after an order for the attachment of debts, obligations or liabilities has been made, it is suggested by the garnishee that the debt, obligation or liability sought to be attached belongs to or is claimed by a third person, or that a third person has a lien or charge on it, a judge may order the third person to appear and to state the nature and particulars of his or her claim on it.








Order for trial or payment on hearing third person





18



After hearing the allegations of the third person under the order, and of any other person whom the judge, by the same or a subsequent order, may order to appear, or if the third person or other person does not appear when ordered, the judge may order payment by the garnishee, or may order any issue or question to be tried or determined, and may bar the claim of the third person or other person, or may make any other order as the judge sees fit, on terms, in all cases with respect to the lien or charge, if any, of the third person and as to costs, as the judge thinks just and reasonable.








Judge may take evidence in chambers

(2)


The costs, if not ordered to be satisfied in another way, must be paid by the garnishing plaintiff.

Payment by the garnishee into court of the amounts payable for the debts, obligations and liabilities attached, or the amount limited by the garnishing order or in compliance with an order of a judge, or satisfaction of the order, either by execution, levied or otherwise, under any proceeding as aforesaid, is a valid discharge as against the defendant debtor to the amount paid, levied or otherwise made, although the proceeding may be set aside or the judgment reversed.

(2)


The same proceedings must be had as an execution against the partnership, firm or company and otherwise as if the order had been made on an individual debtor, and process may issue against the partnership, firm or company in the name of the partnership, firm or company in the same manner as may now be done in any action or other proceeding.






(3)


This section applies to proceedings in the Provincial Court.








Service of attaching order on partnership, firm or company





25



Service of the order referred to in section 24 (1) on any member of a partnership, firm or secretary of a company, at its usual place of business, if any, in British Columbia, or on an authorized agent of the partnership, firm or company, is sufficient for all purposes.








Different debts may be included in one order





26



A judge or a registrar may make an order attaching any number of debts owing from different debtors to the judgment debtor or defendant, and the service of a notice of the purport of the order, with information on where the order can be seen, is sufficient to bind the debts in the hands of the garnishees.

(a)


the employer must at once reinstate the employee in his or her employment on the terms and conditions that were in effect before the offence, and

From the time of registering it, the judgment forms a lien and charge on all the land of the judgment debtor in the land title districts in which the judgment is registered, in the same manner as if charged in writing by the judgment debtor under his or her signature and seal.






(3)


After the registration of the judgment, the judgment creditor may, if he or she wishes to do so, proceed at once on the lien and charge created by it.








Expiration of lien

(1)


A judgment, except a nonexpiring judgment including a renewal of it under subsection (3), registered under this Part, at the expiration of 2 years after the registration or last renewal of registration of it, ceases to form a lien or charge on the land of the judgment debtor, or anyone claiming under the judgment debtor, unless before the expiration of 2 years the registration of the judgment is renewed.






(2)


A nonexpiring judgment registered before October 31, 1979 expires at the end of 2 years after the


Land Title Act


came into force, unless renewed under subsection (3).

Land Registry Act,

to register or renew registration of the judgment.

(a)


to the extent of his or her beneficial interest in the land,






(b)


if an owner is registered as a personal representative or trustee, to the extent of the interest of a beneficiary who is a judgment debtor, and

(4)


The time of registration or the renewal of registration of a judgment is the day and hour when the application under section 88 to register the judgment or the renewal of it is received by the registrar.






(5)


If a judgment is registered under this section against a particular interest in land of the judgment debtor, and the judgment debtor subsequently acquires a further registered estate or interest in the same land, the registration of the judgment, if subsisting on the register, without any further application or other act on the part of the judgment creditor, is deemed to be enlarged so as to include the beneficial interest of the judgment debtor in that further registered estate or interest.






(6)


After registration under this section, the judgment creditor may proceed at once on the lien and charge created by subsection (3).

Fraudulent Preference Act


, orders that the judgment creditor is entitled to register the judgment against the land in respect of which the application was made or against the judgment debtor's or another person's interest in the land, the judgment creditor may apply to the Registrar of Titles, in the same manner as an application is made to register any other judgment, to register the judgment against the land or interest in the land.






(2)


If a judgment is registered on an application made under subsection (1), the Registrar of Titles must, by registered mail, send a notice in the prescribed form together with a copy of the certificate of judgment to every owner of the land against which the judgment has been registered and to the judgment debtor.

sealed with the seal of the court in which the judgment was entered or recovered, and

Land Title Act


to register

in the same manner and with the same effect as if the original certificate were produced.

includes a person alleged by the judgment creditor to be a judgment debtor and to have acquired from or through a registered owner, by transfer, transmission or otherwise, an estate or interest in the land in question.

The registrar, on completion of a registration under section 88 must, by registered mail, send to the owner against whose title the judgment has been registered a notice in the prescribed form, together with a copy of the certificate of judgment.






(3)


Except as provided in section 91 (4), subsection (2) does not apply to a renewal of a judgment.






(4)


If no reply is received from the owner as provided in the notice, no further act by the registrar is required in respect of the notice.






(5)

(a)


take evidence under oath or otherwise,






(b)


require the production of records, and






(c)


decide whether or not the owner is, in fact, the judgment debtor and whether the judgment does or does not affect the land described.

(7)


The registrar must at once deliver or mail by registered mail to the owner and the judgment creditor a copy of the order.






(8)

(9)


If the registrar decides that the owner is the judgment debtor, the registrar must make an order accordingly and promptly deliver or mail by registered mail a copy of the order to both the judgment creditor and the owner.






(10)


If the judgment creditor does not approve of an order made under subsection (6) or an owner does not approve of an order made under subsection (9), he or she may, within 21 days after the registrar's order is delivered or mailed to him or her, make an application in the nature of an appeal to the Supreme Court, and section 309 of the


Land Title Act


applies in respect of the application.






(11)


If the registrar cancels the judgment under subsection (8), the judgment creditor must at once pay the owner $25 as compensation for expenses incurred as a result of the registration of the certificate of judgment.






(12)


The compensation payable under subsection (11) constitutes a debt recoverable in the Provincial Court.






(13)


If a notice under subsection (2) is mailed to the person referred to in subsection (1) a copy must also be mailed to the registered owner.

90



(1)


Even though payment has been made under section 89 (11), if the registrar has cancelled the registration of a judgment under section 89 and the owner against whose land the judgment was registered has sustained damage or incurred costs or expenses, by reason of the judgment creditor without reasonable cause having registered the judgment, the owner may apply to a court for compensation.






(2)


The court may award a sum it considers just, taking into account the amount paid or to be paid under section 89 (11).






(3)


The court may take into consideration evidence that all proper and necessary steps were not taken by the judgment creditor to ensure that the judgment debtor was the same person as the registered owner whose name is similar.






(4)


A registered owner may make a claim for compensation under this section against a judgment creditor by reason of his or her having registered a judgment against a person alleged to be a judgment debtor and to have acquired from or through a registered owner, by transfer, transmission or otherwise, an estate or interest in the land in question.








Expiration and renewal





91



(1)


Except for a nonexpiring judgment, registration of a judgment ceases, at the expiration of 2 years after the date of the application for registration or the date of the last application to renew registration, to form a lien and charge on the land affected by the registration unless, before the expiration of the 2 years, application is made to renew the registration of the judgment.

The registration of a judgment may be renewed at any time before the end of 2 years after the registration or last renewal of registration of the judgment.






(3)


An application for the renewal of a judgment must comply with the requirements of the


Land Title Act


.






(4)


On receiving an application for the renewal of a judgment, the registrar must comply with section 89 if notice in the prescribed form has not been previously sent in respect of the same judgment and the same land.






(5)


If a renewal of registration is effected under this section and an endorsement is made in the register, and there is a subsisting entry of the judgment in the register of judgments, the entry is deemed to be cancelled as to the interest of the judgment debtor in the land described in the register.






(6)


Section 86 (5) applies to renewals registered under this section.








Procedure for enforcing charge





92



(1)


If a judgment creditor has registered a judgment under this Act, and alleges that the judgment debtor is entitled to or has an interest in any land, or that any land is held subject to the lien created by registration of judgment under section 82, a motion may be made in Supreme Court Chambers, by the judgment creditor calling on the judgment debtor, and on any trustee or other person having the legal estate in the land in question, to show cause why any land in the land title district in which the judgment is registered, or the interest in it of the judgment debtor, or a competent part of the land, should not be sold to realize the amount payable under the judgment.






(2)


If the judgment debtor is dead, the motion to show cause must call on those to whom the interest of the deceased in the land in question has passed, and on any trustee or other person having the legal estate in it.






(3)


Any notice of application or order made on it under this section may, in any case where in the opinion of the court personal service cannot be reasonably effected, be served in a manner the court directs, and the court may in any case allow service of the notice of application or order to be made out of the jurisdiction.








Determination of disputed questions





93



On an application under section 92, the proceedings must be had, either in a summary way or by the trial of an issue, or by inquiry before an officer of the court, as the court thinks necessary or convenient, for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of the matters in question, and whether the land, or the interest in it of the judgment debtor, is liable for the satisfaction of the judgment.








Reference to ascertain land and settle priorities





94



(1)


If an order is made on an application under section 92, there must be included in the order a reference to a district registrar of the Supreme Court






(a)


to find what land is liable to be sold under the judgment,






(b)


to find what is the interest of the judgment debtor in the land and of his or her title to it,






(c)


to find what judgments form a lien and charge against the land and the priorities between the judgments,






(d)


to determine how the proceeds of the sale are to be distributed, and






(e)


to report all the findings to the court.






(2)


The district registrar must deal with all judgments registered against the land whether registered before or after the judgment on which the proceedings are taken.






(3)


Unless good reason is found to the contrary, the creditor first taking proceedings is entitled to his or her costs in priority to all claims under the judgment whether before or after his or her own.






(4)


The district registrar must serve all persons affected by his or her inquiries.






(5)


The report, when made, requires confirmation by the Supreme Court, and all persons affected by it must have notice of the application for confirmation, and on application the court may confirm all or part of the report, and may alter it or may refer it back to the district registrar.








Registrar may retain sufficient sum to satisfy claim under

Creditor Assistance Act






95



If a person has a contested claim pending under the


Creditor Assistance Act


, he or she may give notice of it to any district registrar to whom a reference has been made under section 94, and the district registrar must provide in his or her report for the retention of a sufficient sum to give that person the share of the proceeds to which he or she would be entitled if that person had a judgment for the amount he or she claims, and the sum must be retained until the contestation of the claim is disposed of under the


Creditor Assistance Act


.








Order for sale of land





96



(1)


If in a summary way or on the trial of an issue, or as the result of inquiries under sections 92 to 95, or otherwise, any land or the interest of any judgment debtor in it is found liable to be sold, an order must be made by the court declaring what land or what interest in it is liable to be sold, and directing the sale of it by the sheriff.






(2)


Despite subsection (1), if a premises situated on the land or interest in it of a judgment debtor is the home of the debtor, the court may defer the sale, subject to the performance by the judgment debtor of terms and conditions of payment or otherwise as the court imposes.






(3)


If in any case substituted service has been ordered by the court on the judgment debtor of the notice of civil claim or notice of family claim, as the case may be, or other process in the proceeding in which the judgment is obtained, the land ordered to be sold must not be sold by the sheriff until it has been advertised as provided in section 97 for 6 months after the order for sale.






(4)


Despite subsection (3), on application by the judgment creditor to the Supreme Court, the court may shorten the period of 6 months referred to in that subsection, or make any other order in that behalf it thinks fit.








Court may direct notification of claimants not before court





97



(1)


If, on an application for an order for the sale of land, it appears to the court, on affidavit setting out the fact, that there may be persons interested in the land to be sold whose names are unknown to the judgment creditor, the court may, if it thinks fit, direct advertisements to be published at times and in a manner the court thinks fit, calling on all persons claiming to be interested in the land to come in and establish their respective claims to it in chambers in a time to be limited by the court.






(2)

(3)


If the land purchased by the mortgagee is subject to a mortgage or other pecuniary charge, other than his or her mortgage, that has priority over the execution under which the land has been sold, or if any other person becomes the purchaser at the sale of land on which there is a mortgage or other pecuniary charge that has priority over the execution, if the person entitled to the encumbrance enforces payment of the amount of it, or any part of it, or any interest or costs, then the purchaser must repay to the mortgagor or other person who has been enforced to make any payment the amount paid, or a proportionate part of it, ascertained or to be ascertained under subsection (2).






(4)


In default of repayment by the purchaser under subsection (3) within one month after demand, the person who has made the payment, the person's executors or administrators, may recover from the purchaser the amount paid, with interest, in a proceeding for money had and received; and until the money has been repaid with interest the person or his or her executors or administrators have a charge for it on the land purchased.








No sale on day of sale





104



If, at the time set for the sale under an order, no bidders appear, or if in the opinion of the sheriff the biddings are not sufficient to justify a sale, the sheriff may adjourn the sale.








Conveyance of land sold





105



(1)


On a sale of land under this Part, the sheriff must execute to the purchaser a conveyance, under the sheriff's signature and seal, of the land sold, in Form C of Schedule 3, or to similar effect, and must in the conveyance fully, distinctly and sufficiently describe the land and interest in it that has been sold.






(2)


The conveyance referred to in subsection (1), when delivered to the purchaser, and registered in the land title office for the land title district in which the land is located, vests in the purchaser, according to the nature of the property sold, all the legal and equitable estate and interest of the execution debtor in it at the time of the registration against the land of the first judgment, as well as at the time of the sale, or at any intermediate time, discharged from the first judgment and from all judgments and other charges against the execution debtor and his or her land, subsequent to the first judgment.






(3)


Despite subsection (1) and (2), if the execution debtor's interest in the land sold under this Part is that of a mortgagee or a vendor under an agreement to sell the land, the conveyance executed by the sheriff under subsection (1) vests in the purchaser no right to payment of any money paid by or on behalf of the mortgagor or the purchaser under the agreement to sell the land, as the case may be, prior to receipt of notice of the judgment by the mortgagor or the purchaser, or his or her personal representative.






(4)

Purchaser not to be affected by irregularities





107



The purchaser at a sale is not bound to ascertain whether the requirements of this Part have been performed, and despite a breach of this Part or any impropriety or irregularity in the sale or otherwise of which the purchaser may or may not have notice, if he or she is not a party to it, and despite any informality in the conveyance of the property sold, the conveyance, when executed by the sheriff and delivered to the purchaser, is deemed to be valid.








Proceeding not to abate by marriage, death or bankruptcy





108



(1)


For this Part, a proceeding must not be considered to have abated, and an order for the sale of land or any sale under it is not in any way affected, by reason of the marriage, death or bankruptcy of any of the persons named in the judgment.

(3)


Nothing in this Part affects the right of the execution debtor to receive rent or interest that is due for the land previous to the day of the sale of it.








Power of purchasers to satisfy encumbrances





109



(1)


A purchaser may remove or satisfy a mortgage or other encumbrance that, at the time of the sale, existed on land purchased, in a similar manner as the execution debtor might have done and, on removing or satisfying the mortgage or other encumbrance, the purchaser acquires the same estate, right, title and interest as the execution debtor would have acquired in case the removal or satisfaction had been effected by the execution debtor.






(2)


The mortgagee or other encumbrancer must, if required, give to the purchaser, at the cost of the purchaser, a certificate of the satisfaction of mortgage or other encumbrance, which certificate may be in Form D of Schedule 3.






(3)


The presentation of the certificate referred to in subsection (2) to the registrar of titles is sufficient authority for the registrar of titles to cancel the registration of the mortgage or other encumbrance for which it is given.








Payment into court of money from sale





110



Money realized by the sale of land under this Part is money levied under execution within the meaning of the


Creditor Assistance Act

Land Title Act


, and on the production to him or her of the sheriff's conveyance to the purchaser, attested and proved in the manner prescribed by that Act, register it according to the estate or interest in the land stated in it to have been sold, and must grant the certificate, if any, as may be provided by the


Land Title Act


for the estate or interest which may be sold.






(2)


In the case of an indefeasible or absolute fee, the indefeasible or absolute title, if any, outstanding in the name of the execution debtor is deemed to be cancelled as to the estate or interest of the debtor, or the portion registered in the name of the purchaser.








Sheriff's fees





113



(1)


A sale of land under an order made under this Part must be conducted by the sheriff or his or her deputy in person, and for those services he or she is entitled to receive the same fees, expenses and poundage as are allowed the sheriff for the sale of land by execution under the


Supreme Court Act


and the applicable Rules of Court.






(2)


If the land of the execution debtor is advertised under an order for sale of it, but is not sold by reason of satisfaction having been otherwise obtained, or for some other cause, and no money is actually levied on the execution, the sheriff is entitled to receive fees, expenses and poundage based on the assessed value of the land at the same rate as is allowed for fees, expenses and poundage under the applicable Rules of Court.






(3)


If a sheriff has seized personal property of a debtor under a writ of execution, and the personal property is not sold and no money is levied on the execution of the writ, the sheriff is entitled to receive fees, expenses and poundage based on the smaller of the amount of the judgment or the amount settled for, at the same rate as allowed under the applicable Rules of Court, or if a court directs a smaller rate, at that rate.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,


DESIRING to provide on the basis of reciprocity for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters;


HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:



Part I

(b) "the 1968 Convention" means the Convention of 27th September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters as amended;


(c) "court of a Contracting State" means

(ii) in relation to Canada, the Federal Court of Canada or any court of a province or territory to which this Convention extends pursuant to Article XII,


and the expressions "court of the United Kingdom" and "court of Canada" shall be construed accordingly;


(d) "judgment" means any decision, however described (judgment, order and the like), given by a court in a civil or commercial matter, and includes an award in proceedings on an arbitration if the award has become enforceable in the territory of origin in the same manner as a judgment given by a court in that territory;


(e) "judgment creditor" means the person in whose favour the judgment was given, and includes his executors, administrators, successors and assigns;


(f) "judgment debtor" means the person against whom the judgment was given and includes any person against whom the judgment is enforceable under the law of the territory of origin;


(g) "original court" in relation to any judgment means the court by which the judgment was given;


(h) "registering court" means a court to which an application for the registration of a judgment is made;


(i) "territory of origin" means the territory for which the original court was exercising jurisdiction.



PART II




Scope of the Convention




ARTICLE II



1. Subject to the provisions of this Article, this Convention shall apply to any judgment given by a court of a Contracting State after the Convention enters into force and, for the purposes of Article IX, to any judgment given by a court of a third State which is a party to the 1968 Convention.


2. This Convention shall not apply to


(a) orders for the periodic payment of maintenance;


(b) the recovery of taxes, duties or charges of a like nature or the recovery of a fine or penalty;


(c) judgments given on appeal from decisions of tribunals other than courts;

4. This Convention is without prejudice to any other remedy available to a judgment creditor for the recognition and enforcement in one Contracting State of a judgment given by a court of the other Contracting State.



PART III




Enforcement of Judgments




ARTICLE III



1. Where a judgment has been given by a court of one Contracting State, the judgment creditor may apply in accordance with Article VI to a court of the other Contracting State at any time within a period of six years after the date of the judgment (or, where there have been proceedings by way of appeal against the judgment, after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings) to have the judgment registered, and on any such application the registering court shall, subject to such simple and rapid procedures as each Contracting State may prescribe and to the other provisions of this Convention, order the judgment to be registered.


2. In addition to the sum of money payable under the judgment of the original court including interest accrued to the date of registration, the judgment shall be registered for the reasonable costs of and incidental to registration, if any, including the costs of obtaining a certified copy of the judgment from the original court.


3. If, on an application for the registration of a judgment, it appears to the registering court that the judgment is in respect of different matters and that some, but not all, of the provisions of the judgment are such that if those provisions had been contained in separate judgments those judgments could properly have been registered, the judgment may be registered in respect of the provisions aforesaid but not in respect of any other provisions contained therein.


4. Subject to the other provisions of this Convention


(a) a registered judgment shall, for the purposes of enforcement, be of the same force and effect;


(b) proceedings may be taken on it; and


(c) the registering court shall have the same control over its enforcement,


as if it had been a judgment originally given in the registering court with effect from the date of registration.



ARTICLE IV



1. Registration of a judgment shall be refused or set aside if


(a) the judgment has been satisfied;


(b) the judgment is not enforceable in the territory of origin;


(c) the original court is not regarded by the registering court as having jurisdiction;


(d) the judgment was obtained by fraud;


(e) enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to public policy in the territory of the registering court;


(f) the judgment is a judgment of a country or territory other than the territory of origin which has been registered in the original court or has become enforceable in the territory of origin in the same manner as a judgment of that court; or


(g) in the view of the registering court the judgment debtor either is entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of that court or was entitled to immunity in the original court and did not submit to its jurisdiction.


2. The law of the registering court may provide that registration of a judgment may or shall be set aside if


(a) the judgment debtor, being the defendant in the original proceedings, either was not served with the process of the original court or did not receive notice of those proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to defend the proceedings and, in either case, did not appear;


(b) another judgment has been given by a court having jurisdiction in the matter in dispute prior to the date of judgment in the original court; or


(c) the judgment is not final or an appeal is pending or the judgment debtor is entitled to appeal or to apply for leave to appeal against the judgment in the territory of origin.


3. If at the date of the application for registration the judgment of the original court has been partly satisfied, the judgment shall be registered only in respect of the balance remaining payable at that date.


4. A judgment shall not be enforced so long as, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention and the law of the registering court, it is competent for any party to make an application to have the registration of the judgment set aside or, where such an application is made, until the application has been finally determined.



ARTICLE V



1. For the purposes of Article IV (1) (c) the original court shall be regarded as having jurisdiction if


(a) the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, submitted to the jurisdiction of that court by voluntarily appearing in the proceedings;


(b) the judgment debtor was plaintiff in, or counterclaimed in, the proceedings in the original court;


(c) the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, had before the commencement of the proceedings agreed, in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings, to submit to the jurisdiction of that court or of the courts of the territory of origin;


(d) the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, was at the time when the proceedings were instituted habitually resident in, or being a body corporate had its principal place of business in, the territory of origin;


(e) the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, had an office or place of business in the territory of origin and the proceedings were in respect of a transaction effected through or at that office or place; or


(f) the jurisdiction of the original court is otherwise recognised by the registering court.


2. Notwithstanding anything in sub-paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of paragraph (1), the original court shall not be regarded as having jurisdiction if


(a) the subject matter of the proceedings was immovable property outside the territory of origin; or


(b) the bringing of the proceedings in the original court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of the territory of origin.



Part IV




Procedures




ARTICLE VI



1. Any application for the registration in the United Kingdom of a judgment of a court of Canada shall be made


(a) in England and Wales, to the High Court of Justice;

4. The registering court may require that an application for registration be accompanied by


(a) the judgment of the original court or a certified copy thereof;


(b) a certified translation of the judgment, if given in a language other than the language of the territory of the registering court;

All matters concerning

shall be determined by the law of the registering court.



Part V




Recognition of Judgments




ARTICLE VIII



Any judgment given by a court of one Contracting State for the payment of a sum of money which could be registered under this Convention, whether or not the judgment has been registered, and any other judgment given by such a court, which if it were a judgment for the payment of a sum of money could be registered under this Convention, shall, unless registration has been or would be refused or set aside on any ground other than that the judgment has been satisfied or could not be enforced in the territory of origin, be recognised in a court of the other Contracting State as conclusive between the parties thereto in all proceedings founded on the same cause of action.



Part VI




Recognition and Enforcement of Third State Judgments




ARTICLE IX



1. The United Kingdom undertakes, in the circumstances permitted by Article 59 of the 1968 Convention, not to recognize or enforce under that Convention any judgment given in a third State which is a Party to that Convention against a person domiciled or habitually resident in Canada.
