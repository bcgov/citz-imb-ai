Continuation of leases for certain disposal well purposes





61.1



(1)


In this section:



"eligible disposal well"

means a well that is used or planned to be used to dispose of water, carbon dioxide or other waste fluids associated with petroleum or natural gas exploration, production or processing;



"eligible lease"

means a lease for a location that includes all or part of an eligible spacing area;



"eligible spacing area"

means a spacing area, other than a spacing area that is subject to a special project under section 75 of the


Energy Resource Activities Act


, that






(a)


contains an eligible disposal well,






(b)


is, in the opinion of the director, planned to contain an eligible disposal well, or






(c)


is, in the opinion of the director, likely to be needed in relation to an existing or planned eligible disposal well that is situated on a nearby spacing area.






(2)


If an eligible lease expires, whether after its initial term or after a continuation under this section or under section 58, 61 or 62, on application by the lessee made not later than 60 days after the expiry of the lease, the director may continue that lease for one year in respect of one or more zones in the eligible spacing area that the director considers are appropriate in relation to the relevant existing or planned eligible disposal well.






(3)


If all or part of an eligible lease is continued under this section, the petroleum and natural gas rights granted by the lease that are stratigraphically outside the zone or zones identified by the director under subsection (2) revert to the government when that continuation begins, subject to any continuation under section 58.








Continuation with penalty





62



(1)


Subject to regulations, if any, made under section 133 (2) (n.1), the term of a lease not continued under section 58 (3), 61 or 61.1 or under the regulations may be continued, on payment to the government of the prescribed penalty, for one year in respect of all or part of its location.

may be continued under subsection (1) immediately after

Default in rental or work





63



(1)


Despite sections 58, 61, 61.1 and 62, if a lessee fails to pay the rental, the lease expires 60 days after the date the rental was payable unless on or before the 60 days have elapsed, the lessee pays






(a)


the rental, and






(b)


in addition, as a penalty for each 30 day period or portion of a period that the lessee is in default, a sum equal to 1.5% of the rental.






(2)


If a lease expires under subsection (1), the minister may reinstate the lease if






(a)


the minister is satisfied that the lessee's failure referred to in subsection (1) was inadvertent or the result of circumstances, other than financial circumstances, beyond the control of the lessee,






(b)


there has been, during the period starting on the date of the expiry and ending on the date of the reinstatement, no disposition under this Act of rights to petroleum and natural gas that were subject to the lease, and






(c)


the former lessee makes an application under section 51 and pays the prescribed reinstatement fee.






(3)


If the minister reinstates a lease under subsection (2), the lease is conclusively deemed not to have expired under subsection (1).

Part 7 — Spacing Areas







Normal spacing areas





65



(1)


For the purposes of this Act and the


Energy Resource Activities Act


, British Columbia, except where insufficient area exists adjacent to its boundaries, is divided into normal spacing areas for petroleum and natural gas wells as follows:






(a)


the boundaries of a unit, and the vertical planes extending directly beneath each of those boundaries, are the boundaries of a normal spacing area for petroleum wells;






(b)


the boundaries of a spacing area for a natural gas well in the Peace River Block coincide with the boundaries of each section, and the boundaries of a spacing area for a petroleum well coincide with the boundaries of each quarter section;






(c)


in areas other than the Peace River Block






(i)


the boundary of an area comprising 2 units by 2 units, and the vertical planes extending directly beneath each of the boundaries of that area, are the boundaries of a normal spacing area for a natural gas well, and






(ii)


the pattern of normal spacing areas for natural gas wells is based on an initial 4 unit area centred on a corner common to any 4 blocks.






(2)


Subsection (1) does not apply to a well drilled only for the exploration, development or use of a storage reservoir.








Other than normal spacing





65.1



(1)


The minister may make regulations respecting other than normal spacing in an area of British Columbia if the minister is satisfied that the regulations






(a)


would facilitate petroleum or natural gas exploration and development,






(b)


are necessary to promote the conservation of petroleum and natural gas resources, or






(c)


are necessary to protect the environment.






(2)


The regulator, by order, may on its own initiative or on application under section 75 (3) of the


Energy Resource Activities Act


approve other than normal spacing for a pool or portion of a pool on a parcel of land or a location if






(a)


the regulator is satisfied that it would facilitate drilling and production operations, and






(b)


the parcel of land or location, as the case may be, is not subject to a regulation made under subsection (1).






(2.1)


Despite any applicable order made under subsection (2), a pool or a portion of a pool on a parcel of land, or a location, must be considered, for the purposes of section 58, to be divided into normal spacing areas in accordance with section 65, unless the minister orders otherwise.






(3)


A regulation under subsection (1) or an order under subsection (2) must specify target areas within each other than normal spacing area and may specify methods of determining and conditions that apply to that spacing.






(4)


[Repealed 2008-36-170.]








Ministerial designations





66



If a parcel of Crown reserve that contains other than a normal spacing area for a natural gas well is acquired, the minister, on application by an owner, may designate in that parcel other than a normal spacing area for a natural gas well.








No production unless other than normal spacing areas pooled with adjoining areas





67



Production from a natural gas well within a spacing area that is not a normal spacing area may not be taken until the spacing area of the well is pooled with adjacent areas to form a normal spacing area or a spacing area prescribed or ordered under section 65.1.





Part 8 — Pooling of Locations







Pooling of locations to operate spacing areas





68



(1)


Two or more holders of locations in a spacing area may pool their locations for purposes of joint development of the spacing area or joint operation of a well in the spacing area, or both.

After reviewing the submissions, the minister may refuse to make an order, or the minister may






(a)


order that the locations, or parts of the locations, as the minister may designate, be pooled,






(b)


order, subject to the


Energy Resource Activities Act


, that a well be drilled and operated, or, if drilled, that it be operated,






(c)


designate a person the minister considers appropriate for the purpose of carrying out an order, designation or requirement under this section,






(d)


specify the proportions in which holders share petroleum and natural gas produced,






(e)


specify the proportions in which holders share the costs of drilling, operating and abandoning the well, and






(f)


specify the manner and time in which, and the conditions subject to which, petroleum and natural gas produced from the pooled locations must be sold.






(4)


If locations are pooled, the drilling, operating and abandoning of the well, and the production of petroleum and natural gas from the well, are deemed to be carried out, in the proportions referred to in the pooling agreement or order, on the location of each holder.






(5)


The minister may make a pooling agreement on behalf of the government on the terms the minister believes proper.








Pooling by board order





69



(1)


If petroleum and natural gas in a spacing area is reserved in part to persons other than the government, those persons, or the holder of a location in the same spacing area, may apply to the board for an order that all petroleum or natural gas or both in that spacing area be pooled.






(2)


The board must include in the order terms and conditions respecting the pooling that it considers necessary.
