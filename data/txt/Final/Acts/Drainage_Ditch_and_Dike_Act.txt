notice convening the Court of Revision, or otherwise, and the
assessment roll is for all purposes the assessment roll of the
district.






Engineer's plan conclusive as to area of district




95

(1)


The plan deposited in the land title office under section 72 (2) as
the plan is amended, if at all, by the Court of Revision or by the
judge on appeal, is, from the date of its deposit, but subject to
sections 73 and 74, conclusive evidence of the area of the district to
which it refers, and of all land constituting it.




(2)

All land mentioned or described in the order in council constituting
the district, and not shown on the plan as amended, if at all, from

First charge vested in commissioners




96

(1)


The plan and assessment roll when deposited, and all taxes that may be
levied by the commissioners on the land included and mentioned in it,
must, subject to alterations made in it by the Court of Revision or by
the judge on appeal, be registered as a first charge on or against
each separate lot of land or portion that is the subject of separate
ownership, shown on the plan and mentioned in the assessment roll, to
the extent of the taxes that the commissioners are authorized to levy
for each lot or portion of it, and the charge is vested in the
commissioners.




(2)

The valuation of the charge for registration purposes is the estimated
cost of the works and, in addition to the registration fees under the

Land Title Act

, 10¢ is payable for each registration after the first, under which
the charge is registered.




(3)

Similar additional fees are payable on the registration of any
security given by the commissioners under their borrowing powers.






Power to prepare and revise new assessment roll

(2)

The commissioners may, without any petition, have a new assessment
roll prepared at any time if they are of the opinion that the existing
assessment roll is inequitable.




(3)

In the preparation and revision of any new assessment roll it is not
necessary to prepare a new plan showing the land benefited by the
works of the district.

The fees payable for the deposit of an assessment roll under
subsection (5) are $2.50, and 10¢ for each parcel of land to which the
new assessment roll applies.




(7)

A new assessment roll when deposited in the land title office is the
assessment roll for the district and is effective and binding on all
persons affected, despite any defect or error in it or any defect,
omission, error or misstatement in any notice required to be given or
the omission to transmit or publish any notice.




(8)

During the time a new assessment roll is effective, all taxes required
to be levied must be levied in accordance with the new assessment
roll.




(9)

The preparation, revision and depositing of a new assessment roll does
not affect the boundaries of the district.




(10)

The preparation, revision and depositing of a new assessment roll does
not prejudice the right of the commissioners to enforce payment of
taxes levied before the new assessment roll became effective.






Alterations and additional works




98

(1)


If the commissioners at any time after the deposit of the plans under
section 76, and whether before or after the completion of the
proposed works, think it necessary, for the purposes for which the
proposed works were undertaken, to alter the nature of the proposed
works or to execute additional works, they may cause a supplementary
plan, showing the proposed alterations or additional works, to be
prepared by the engineer and filed in the land title office.




(2)

Sections 75, 76, 79 and sections 88 to 93 must, with the
necessary changes, be complied with before the commissioners proceed
to execute the proposed alterations or additional works.






Petition for better drainage of land within district not sufficiently
drained




99

(1)


If at any time after the works have been carried out under the plans
as prepared by the engineer and approved by the commissioners, there
is land in the district which, in the opinion of the owners of it, is
not sufficiently drained, the commissioners, on receiving a petition
signed by a majority in value of the owners of the land asking that
better drainage be provided, may instruct the engineer to




(a)

make a survey of that land and an estimate of the cost of the proposed
work, and




(b)

prepare in duplicate a plan of the land and an assessment roll showing
the amount to be levied against each lot or subdivision of the land
based on the benefit to be derived from the proposed work.




(2)

If in the opinion of the commissioners the work should be proceeded
with, they may, after depositing a copy of the plan and assessment
roll, signed by the commissioners and the engineer, in the land title
office for the district in which the land is located, levy the taxes
as provided and proceed to carry out the work asked for in the
petition.




(3)

Section 79 and sections 88 to 93 apply to and must be complied with
before any new or additional assessments are levied under this
section, and the provisions of this Part relating to assessments and
to the carrying out of the works undertaken under it apply to all
assessments and works made and carried out under this section.






Power of commissioners to execute, operate and maintain works




100

(1)


The commissioners may have executed the works shown on the deposited
plans referred to in sections 75, 98 and 99, or decided
on in accordance with the plans, and see that the works are operated
and maintained in a proper state of repair.




(2)

The commissioners must




(a)

make, levy and collect taxes, and properly apply all sums collected,
and




(b)

generally carry out this Part.




(3)

In maintaining and operating the works, the commissioners may execute
works as necessary for the efficient operation of the existing works
and for maintaining them in a proper state of repair, but works that
injuriously affect natural or artificial waterways must not be
executed until approved by the minister.




(4)

If, for the purpose of maintaining works operated and maintained under
this Part, the commissioners think it necessary to construct a new
dike inside an existing dike and to abandon the whole or any portion
of the existing dike, the commissioners may have executed under this
section all works necessary for the construction of the new dike, and
may abandon the whole or any portion of the existing dike.




(5)

The commissioners must have a plan prepared by the engineer, and filed
in the land title office, showing the proposed works and describing
the portion of the existing dike that it is proposed to abandon and
the land in the district that will cease to be benefited by the works
operated and maintained by the commissioners.




(6)

Sections 75, 76, 79, and sections 88 to 93 must, with the
necessary changes, be complied with before the commissioners proceed
to execute the proposed works.




(7)

The provisions of this Part relating to assessments, the borrowing of
money, and the execution, operation and maintenance of works apply to
all works executed under subsection (4).






Exemption from taxation of land that ceases to be benefited on
abandonment of dike




101

(1)


If, on the construction of the new dike and the abandonment of all or
part of the existing dike, any land in the district ceases to be
benefited by the works operated and maintained by the commissioners,
that land is, from the time of the abandonment, exempt from the levy
on it of any taxes by the commissioners under this Part, and the
amount of taxes that otherwise would be levied by the commissioners
against that land must be levied against the other land in the
district as part of the cost of maintenance of the works in the
district.




(2)

Nothing in subsection (1) affects the right of any person to enforce
any charge or security existing at the time of the abandonment, in the
event of the failure of the commissioners to meet in full all claims
under the charge or security, and the land exempted remains liable for
all unpaid taxes that have been levied on it under this Part before
the abandonment.




(3)

If all taxes levied under this Part on the land exempted have been
paid, and no mortgage, debenture, bond or other obligation issued by
the commissioners to secure money borrowed under this Part on the
security of a charge on that land is outstanding, the commissioners
must issue a certificate to the owner of each lot or portion of lot
comprised in the land exempted, which must describe the lot or portion
of lot and state that it has been exempted under this section from the
levy of taxes on it by the commissioners under this Part.




(4)

On the registration of the certificate in the land title office for
the district in which the land is located, the registrar must cancel
the registration of the charge registered under this Part on or
against the lot or portion of lot described in the certificate.






Assessments to create maintenance fund




102

(1)


The commissioners, in order to create a maintenance fund to provide
for the cost of maintaining and keeping in repair the works under
their care, may assess, levy and collect a rate not to exceed 5% per
year of the cost of the original works, and in proportion to the
assessment levied for it, but if a maintenance fund created
accumulates to more than 25% of the cost of the original works, the
additional levy must be discontinued until the fund accumulated falls
below 25% of the cost of the original works in the district, when it
may again be levied and collected at a rate sufficient to maintain a
25% maintenance fund.




(2)

Subsection (1) does not restrict the commissioners from levying a
higher rate for the purpose of reconstructing a portion of the
original works that becomes unsafe or is destroyed.






Any 2 commissioners may act




103


Any act, matter or thing required to be done by the commissioners may
be done by the majority of them, and if there is a recital in any
deed, contract or other document or instrument that the commissioners
who executed it form all or a majority of those entitled to act, or if
any document or instrument purports to be executed by the
commissioners, it is deemed to be the act, deed or instrument of the
commissioners in the absence of evidence to the contrary.






Validity of assessment roll and charge




104


The assessment roll deposited by the commissioners against the land
mentioned in the assessment roll is absolutely binding, and the
security given for the repayment of any money borrowed by the
commissioners on the security of the charge vested in the
commissioners by section 96 is absolutely valid and binding on the
land and the owners of it, except as varied, if at all, by the Court
of Revision or by the judge on appeal, and must not be quashed or set
aside on any ground, unless an application is made or an action
commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction within 15 days
after the sitting of the Court of Revision held under section 88.






Power to expropriate land




105


The commissioners may enter into and on any land of any person, and
inspect, survey, set out, take, expropriate, hold and acquire any land
that may in their opinion be necessary to have and hold for the
construction, operation, maintenance or repair of any works authorized
by this Part.






Expropriation not limited




106


Nothing in this Part in any way limits or affects the powers of
expropriation that the commissioners may in any case be entitled to
exercise under the

Water Sustainability Act

.






Protection of dikes crossed by highway




107

(1)


Where a dike is crossed by a public highway or private road, the level
of the dike must not be interfered with, but the commissioners are
liable, in the case of a highway or road surveyed or laid out before
that time, for any increase in the first cost of opening up or
constructing the highway or road occasioned by the construction of the
dike.




(2)

If the top of the dike forms a portion of a highway or road, the
authority responsible for the repair of the highway must maintain it
at a constant level and repair all injury directly or indirectly
caused to the dike by its use as a highway or road.




(3)

If a highway is crossed by a ditch necessitating the construction of a
bridge, the commissioners are liable for the first cost of the bridge,
and the authority responsible for the repair of the highway must
maintain it and keep it in proper repair.






Compensation for land damaged




108


If land not taken is injuriously affected by the works executed by the
commissioners, the damage must, if not mutually agreed on, be valued
and assessed by the Supreme Court in accordance with the

Expropriation Act

.






Compensation is part of cost of works




109


Compensation made for land taken or injuriously affected by the works
of the commissioners is part of the cost of the works.






Execution of works by owners




110

(1)


If the commissioners, with the approval of the owners as provided in
section 78, determine to execute the proposed works by means of
labour, teams, tools and materials provided by the owners, they may
requisition the owners in the district to provide labour, teams, tools
and materials.




(2)

If the requisition is not complied with, the commissioners may employ
labour and teams and provide tools and material for that purpose at
the expense of the owners who fail to comply.






Requisition to owners to attend




111


In those cases the commissioners must give 7 days' requisition to
the owners or their agents to attend and provide the labour, teams,
tools and materials, but, in case of sudden breaches in any works or
of any apprehension of a breach, the immediate attendance of any and
all owners may be required.






Owner's duties on being requisitioned




112

(1)


Every owner must, when requisitioned by the commissioners, provide at
the time and place named in the requisition a sufficient number of
labourers with teams, tools and material in proportion to the quantity
of land owned, and for every day's neglect in case of sudden breach,
or the apprehension of one, must pay, besides the owner's taxes, a
fine of $5 for each labourer or for each cart or team requisitioned.




(2)

The fines referred to in subsection (1) must be added to the taxes and
recovered from the land of the owner against whom they are charged,
and become a portion of the taxes against that owner.






Commissioners may have survey of land made




113


If the commissioners think it necessary to have a plan of land in the
district showing the lots, boundaries and the names of the owners,
they may employ a British Columbia land surveyor to make a plan, and
may order the expense of it to be charged against the land surveyed,
and may require the owners or their agents to point out to the
surveyor the boundaries of the respective lots, and the owners and
agents called on are bound by the survey and plan.






Outer and inner dikes




114

(1)


If land enclosed by dikes is enclosed by and protected by other dikes
erected outside the dikes, the commissioners in charge of the land
reclaimed by the outer dikes

must, by giving notice in accordance with section 114.1, call a
meeting of all the owners within the level contained and enclosed by
the outer dikes

.




(2)

The majority in interest and number of the owners referred to in
subsection (1), or in case of their neglect, the commissioners, must
appoint a civil engineer, who must determine what proportion or degree
of benefit has accrued or is likely to accrue to the old or inner
dikes, and must settle and declare the proportion of expense that the
owners of the land within the old dikes ought annually to contribute
and be assessed toward the maintenance and repair of the new dikes.




(3)

The engineer must make a report in writing of the engineer's
proceedings, which must be entered in the books of record for the
outer dikes, and the amounts settled and declared must be borne by the
land within the inner dikes and assessed and collected as other dike
rates.







Notice of meeting respecting inner and outer dikes

less than 6 days before the date of the meeting.







Appeal to judge from decision of engineer




115


An appeal lies to the judge from the decision of the engineer
appointed, on the same terms and under the same conditions as an
appeal from the Court of Revision.






Outer dike ceasing to protect inner




116


If all or part of the outer dikes at any time cease to protect the
inner dikes, the land within the inner dikes must not for that time
contribute or be assessed to the support or repair of the outer dike.






Repair of outer dike




117

(1)


If at any time a majority in interest and number of the owners within
the inner dike are apprehensive that the outer dikes are unsafe or out
of repair, a majority in interest or number of the owners of the whole
level may call on the commissioners to examine the outer dikes.




(2)

If it appears to the commissioners that the outer dikes require
repair, they, with the assent of the majority in interest and number
of the owners of the whole level, must at once have them repaired, or
otherwise, with the same consent, put the inner dikes in a state of
repair as seems most advisable.




(3)

If the inner dikes are repaired, the owners of the land enclosed by
them must bear the whole expense.






Enlargement of district




118

(1)


On receiving a petition signed by a majority in value of the owners of
land in a district and by a majority in value of the owners of land
proposed to be added to the district, and showing




(a)

the description and approximate area of the land proposed to be added,
and




(b)

the nature of the works proposed to be executed,


the Lieutenant Governor in Council may by order in council, after
notice the Lieutenant Governor in Council thinks advisable, enlarge
the existing district and redefine the boundaries of it to include the
additional land.




(2)

On publication in the Gazette of the order in council, the powers of
the commissioners extend to all the land within the boundaries of the
district as redefined, and the commissioners must file a supplementary
plan, prepared by the engineer, in the land title office, showing the
proposed works and the land which in the opinion of the engineer will
be benefited by the proposed works.




(3)

Except as otherwise provided in this section, sections 72
to 76, 79, and 88 to 93 must, with the necessary
changes, be complied with within the time specified in the order in
council, and the provisions of this Part relating to assessments, the
borrowing of money and the execution, operation and maintenance of
works apply to all works executed under this section.




(4)

If the fee simple of a portion of the land proposed to be added to the
district is vested in the government, the minister is entitled on
behalf of the government to sign the petition or to oppose it.






Power to borrow on security of first charge on land and taxes




119

(1)


The commissioners may borrow on the security of the first charge on
the land in the district vested in them by section 96 (1), and all
present and future taxes that may be levied by them, or any part, on
terms they think fit, and without any consent of the Lieutenant
Governor in Council, any money required for the cost of the works,
whether in excess of the estimate made by the engineer or otherwise,
or for the repair or alteration of the works, and for all expenses
incurred by the commissioners incidental to the repair or alteration,
or for the repayment, renewal or refunding of the whole or any part of
any loan or security made or given under it.




(2)

Security under subsection (1) may be given by deed which vests the
first charge and the taxes in the lender, or by a deed of trust
vesting the first charge and the taxes in a trustee for the holder of
bonds and debentures issued by the commissioners.




(3)

The bonds or debentures or other obligations may be issued at par or
at a premium or discount, payable to the bearer or to the registered
holder or otherwise, at a time, within 40 years from the date of
it, and place, and for amounts and bearing a rate of interest the
commissioners determine.




(4)

The deed must specify the objects for which the money is alleged to be
borrowed and the terms of repayment, and must contain a true copy of
the assessment roll showing the extent to which each lot or portion of
it the subject of separate ownership is separately charged under this
section, and the powers, conditions and agreements the commissioners
and the lender or the trustee for the holder of bonds or debentures
may mutually agree on.




(5)

In the case of a district where the works comprise works for
irrigation purposes, power purpose, steam purpose or waterworks
purpose, the commissioners may for securing money borrowed under this
section include in the security mentioned in this section the security
of a first charge on all works vested in the commissioners under this
Part.




(6)

The preparation, revision and depositing in the land title office of
any new assessment roll for any district does not limit or otherwise
prejudice the rights of any person under any deed or other security
given by the commissioners before the new assessment roll became
effective.






Temporary borrowing on security of uncollected taxes




120

(1)


In addition to all other borrowing powers of the commissioners under
this Part, the commissioners may, in each year, borrow money
temporarily on the security of the taxes payable in the year in which
the money is borrowed.




(2)

The money borrowed must bear the rate of interest agreed on and must
be repayable and repaid out of taxes when collected.






Application of money borrowed




121


All money borrowed by the commissioners must be spent by them for the
purposes for which they were borrowed.






Validity of securities irrespective of form




122


A mortgage, debenture, bond or other obligation issued by the
commissioners of any district created under this Part must not be held
invalid because it is not in a particular form, if the obligation
issued is for money advanced to the commissioners for the purposes of
the district.






Debentures transferable by delivery after endorsement in blank




123


A debenture or bond issued by the commissioners and made payable to a
person or order is, after the endorsement of it in blank by that
person, transferable by delivery from the time of endorsement, and the
transfer vests the property of it in the holder and enables the holder
to maintain an action on it in the holder's own name.






What debenture holder as plaintiff must prove




124


In a suit or action on a debenture or bond, it is not necessary for
the plaintiff to set out in the declaration or other pleadings or to
prove the mode by which the plaintiff became the holder of the
debenture or bond, or to set out or to prove the notices, petition,
orders in council or other proceedings under which the debenture or
bond was issued by the district, but it is sufficient in the pleadings
to describe the plaintiff as the holder of the debenture or bond,
alleging the endorsement in blank, if any, and to state briefly its
legal effect and purport, and to make proof accordingly.






Debentures binding despite certain defects




125


Debentures and bonds issued by the commissioners of any district
purporting to be issued under the authority of this Part are valid and
binding on the district, despite any insufficiency in form or
otherwise of the debentures or bonds, or in the authority of the
commissioners in respect of them, if no successful application has
been made to the courts to quash the issue of them within one month
after issue.






Debentures binding after one year's interest paid




126


If debentures or bonds have been issued by commissioners of a district
and the interest that has fallen due has been paid for the period of
one year by the commissioners, the debentures or bonds, or so much as
may be unpaid, are valid and binding on the district and the owners
included in it and on all parties concerned.






Payment of principal and interest




127

(1)


Any debentures or bonds issued by the commissioners of a district may
be made payable, as to principal and interest, or both, in currency or
sterling money, and in the United Kingdom, the United States or
Canada, and the signature to the interest coupons may be written,
stamped, printed or lithographed.




(2)

The debentures or bonds, when issued, may be disposed of by the person
appointed by the commissioners for that purpose to any person they may
think expedient, and at a rate below par if they think it necessary or
advisable to do so.




(3)

Any debenture or bond issued by the commissioners of any district is
valid and recoverable to the full amount, despite its negotiation by
the commissioners at a rate less than par.






Diking taxes in default carry interest




128


All taxes due under this Part bear interest from the time that they
are due and payable, at the rate of 8% per year, and the interest
forms part of and is collectable as the tax itself for which it is
payable.






Recovery of taxes and fines




129

(1)


All taxes and fines may be recovered by and in the name of the
commissioners, with costs, as if they were private debts, and a copy
of the statement referred to in section 82, or of that part that
relates to the particular tax sued for, certified by the Registrar of
Titles or other proper officer to be a true copy of the statement
deposited in the land title office, is conclusive proof of the levy
having been made and of the liability of the owner of the land in
question to pay the tax.




(2)

No tax or fine is subject to set off of a private nature or is to be
joined with any private claim on the part of the commissioners.






Recovery of taxes by sale of lands




130

(1)


In this section, "taxes" includes interest and fines.




(2)

In addition to all other remedies for the recovery of taxes, the
commissioners may, by themselves or by any person authorized by them,
sell the land for which the taxes are in default by public auction as
provided in this Act.






Time and place of sale




131


A sale of land for taxes may be held on a day and at a place and hour
set by the commissioners, and any sale may be adjourned for a period
of not more than 2 days at any one adjournment, until all the
land is disposed of.






Notice of sale




132

(1)


Not less than 30 days before the day set for the sale the
commissioners must mail by registered mail to the owner of each parcel
of land proposed to be sold for taxes and to the holder of each
registered charge on it, as shown by the records of the land title
office, at the last known address of the owner or holder a notice of
the time and place set for the sale, and stating the following:




(a)

a short description of the land for which the taxes are in default;




(b)

the amounts of taxes and fines in default for that land, and interest
chargeable to the date of sale;




(c)

the amount chargeable as costs and expenses connected with the sale,
together with the fees payable for filing the notice of sale in the
land title office, and a fee of $10 for the issuance and
registration of a tax sale deed;




(d)

the total amount of taxes, fines, interest, costs and expenses and
fees stated;




(e)

that if the amounts of taxes, fines, interest, costs and expenses are
not sooner paid, the commissioners will, at the time and place stated
in the notice, offer the land for which the taxes are in default for
sale at public auction.




(2)

No other notice and no publication or advertisement of the sale is
necessary, but the commissioners may advertise the sale as they see
fit.




(3)

The commissioners must prepare and keep a copy of each notice of sale
mailed.




(4)

To cover the costs and expenses connected with the sale of land for
taxes, the commissioners must charge each parcel of land proposed to
be sold $3.






Conduct of sale




133

(1)


On the day and at the hour and place set for the tax sale, if the
amounts of taxes, fines, interest, costs and expenses for the land
described in a notice of sale have not been paid, the commissioners
must offer that land separately for sale at the upset price of the
total amount stated in the notice, and may sell it to the highest
bidder.




(2)

If there is a bid of the upset price, but no higher bid, the person
bidding the upset price must be declared the purchaser.




(3)

If the purchaser of a parcel of land at a tax sale fails to pay
immediately to the commissioners the amount of the purchase money, the
commissioners must at once again offer the parcel for sale.






Notice of sale




134

(1)


Every tax sale purchaser, at the time of the sale and before the
purchaser is given a certificate of sale, must, personally or by an
agent, sign a copy of the notice of sale, and must state on it the
full name, occupation and post office address of the purchaser.




(2)

The copy of the notice signed must be preserved by the commissioners
with all the other books, documents and papers connected with the
sale, and, on the execution under this section of a deed of the land
sold, is deemed to constitute each of the commissioners or their
successors in office authorized agents to apply on behalf of the
purchaser, or, in case of the purchaser's death, on behalf of the
purchaser's personal representatives, at the proper time for
registration of the title to the land.






Tax sale certificate

On the sale of land at a tax sale, the commissioners or any one of
them must sign a certificate to the purchaser, stating that they have
sold the land to the purchaser subject to the right of redemption, and
that unless the land is redeemed within 12 months from the day of
the tax sale they will execute a tax sale deed to the purchaser.




(2)

The certificate must contain the short description of the property,
and must show in detail the amount of the purchase price, and the
amounts of taxes, fines, interest, costs and expenses, fees and
surplus, if any, included in the purchase price.






Surplus proceeds of sale to be held




136

(1)


The commissioners must hold the amount of the surplus, if any, by
which the purchase price exceeds the upset price in trust for the
owner of the land sold, as shown by the notice of sale, pending the
redemption of the land.




(2)

If the land is not redeemed within the period allowed for redemption,
the surplus must be paid over to the owner or the owner's personal
representatives, without interest, on written request to the
commissioners, unless a claim to the surplus is made by some other
person on the ground that the land belonged to that other person, or
that that other person is otherwise entitled to the surplus.




(3)

If a claim is made, and is admitted, the surplus must be paid to the
claimant, but if the claim is not admitted, the surplus must be
retained by the commissioners until the rights of the respective
parties have been determined by action at law or otherwise.






Notices if land sold




137


If land is sold at a tax sale, the commissioners must immediately mail
a notice to the owner of the land, as shown by the notice of sale, to
the owner's address as last known to the commissioners, stating the
name of the purchaser and the amount for which the land was sold, and
must file with the registrar of the land title district in which the
land is located a similar notice to that required by section 272
of the

Land Title Act

.






Liability to forfeiture of land unsold at tax sale




138


If any land offered for sale at a tax sale fails to sell at the upset
price, or at a price greater than the upset price, it becomes subject
to forfeiture to the commissioners under this section, and the
commissioners must file with the registrar of the land title district
in which the land is located a similar notice in respect of the land
to that required by section 272 of the

Land Title Act

.






Right of redemption




139

(1)


If land has been offered for sale at a tax sale and has been sold or
has become subject to forfeiture, the owner of the land, as shown by
the notice of sale, or any person who on the day of the tax sale was a
registered owner of or the registered holder of a charge on the land,
or the person's heirs, executors, administrators, successors or
assigns, or any other person in the person's behalf and in the
person's names, may redeem the land sold or subject to forfeiture by
paying or tendering to the commissioners, within 12 months from
the day on which the land was offered for sale, or last offered for
sale by the commissioners at the tax sale, the amount required to
redeem it under this section.




(2)

If land has been sold, the amount required to redeem it is the full
amount of the purchase price paid by the purchaser, including all
taxes paid by the purchaser for the land since the date of the sale,
with interest on the amounts of the purchase price and taxes paid, at
the rate of 8% per year, from the respective dates of payment to the
date of the redemption payment or tender, together with all unpaid
taxes which have accrued due for the land subsequent to the date of
the sale, and the fee chargeable for filing notice of redemption under
the

Land Title Act

less the fee of $10 for the tax sale deed, and less the amount of the
surplus, if any, standing at the credit of the owner in the hands of
the commissioners, which surplus, on the making of the redemption
payment, must no longer be held in trust for the owner, but must be
treated by the commissioners as part of the redemption money for the
land redeemed.




(3)

If land has become subject to forfeiture, the amount required to
redeem it is the total amount stated in the notice of sale, exclusive
of the fee of $10 for the tax sale deed, with interest on the amount
of the taxes in default at the rate of 8% per year from the date of
the sale to the date of the redemption payment or tender, together
with all unpaid taxes that have accrued due for the land subsequent to
the date of the sale, and the fee chargeable for filing notice of
redemption under the

Land Title Act

.






Notice of period allowed for redemption




140

(1)


If land has been offered for sale at a tax sale, the commissioners
must, within 6 months from the day on which the tax sale was
held, give notice to the owner of the land as shown by the notice of
sale, and to each person who on the day of the tax sale was a
registered owner of the land or the registered holder of a charge on
the land, stating that the land has been sold or has become subject to
forfeiture to the commissioners for taxes in default.




(2)

The notice must also state the day on which the period allowed for
redemption will expire, and that unless the land is sooner redeemed a
tax sale deed will be executed to the purchaser or the forfeiture to
the commissioners will become absolute.




(3)

The notice is deemed properly given if mailed to the address of each
person as last known to the commissioners.






Status of land during redemption period




141


During the period allowed for redemption of land that has been sold or
has become subject to forfeiture under this section, or until redeemed
within that period, the following rules apply:




(a)

the owner of the land, as shown by the notice of sale, must continue
to be assessed and taxed on it;




(b)

the owner has the right of possession of the land as fully as before
the tax sale, subject to the right of the purchaser or the
commissioners to protect the land from destruction and waste;




(c)

if the land is not in the occupation of the owner or the owner's
tenant, or any person entitled to redeem, the purchaser or the
commissioners has or have all rights of action and powers necessary
for protecting the land from destruction and waste, but must not be
held liable for damage done to the property without their knowledge;




(d)

the purchaser may, under this or any other Act, appeal from the
assessment of the land sold, and appear before any Court of Revision
in support of it, as if the purchaser were the owner of the land;




(e)

the purchaser, if the purchaser considers it expedient, may pay taxes
that become due for the land during the period of redemption.






Evidence of redemption




142

(1)


The commissioners must give to the person making a redemption payment
for land that has been sold or has become subject to forfeiture, a
receipt stating the amount paid and the object of the payment, which
receipt is evidence of the redemption of the land.




(2)

On the redemption of land that has been sold or has become subject to
forfeiture, the commissioners must file with the registrar of the land
title district in which the land is located a notice similar to that
required by section 273 of the

Land Title Act

.






Purchaser's rights on redemption of land sold




143

(1)


On the redemption of land sold at a tax sale, the purchaser at the tax
sale is entitled to receive from the commissioners all amounts of
purchase price and taxes paid by the purchaser, with interest at the
rate of 8% per year from the respective dates of payment to the date
of the redemption payment, and the commissioners must forward by
registered post to the address of the purchaser as last known to the
commissioners a notice stating that the land has been redeemed, and
that the amount to which the purchaser is entitled out of the
redemption money will be paid to the purchaser on application.




(2)

From the time of the payment or tender to the commissioners of the
full amount of the redemption payment required by this section, the
purchaser ceases to have any further right in or to the land.






Tax sale deed




144

(1)


If land that has been sold at a tax sale is not redeemed in accordance
with this section, the commissioners, on the expiration of the period
allowed for redemption, must execute a deed of the land to the
purchaser, or, if the purchaser dies, to the purchaser's personal
representative, and must forward the deed, accompanied by an
application for the registration of the title of the land in the
purchaser or the personal representative, together with a fee of $5,
to the registrar of the land title district in which the land is
located, and the registrar must, and on compliance with
sections 265 and 269 of the

Land Title Act

register the purchaser or the personal representative as owner of the
land comprised in the deed, and issue to that person a certificate of
indefeasible title.




(2)

The registration of a person as owner of the land under a tax sale
deed executed under this section cancels any certificate of title
outstanding for that land, and purges and disencumbers the land of and
from all the right, title and interest of every previous owner of it,
or of those claiming under a previous owner, and of and from all
claims, demands, payments, charges, liens, judgments, mortgages and
encumbrances of every nature and kind, other than the following:




(a)

the restrictive conditions, reservations and exceptions subject to
which the land was held at the time of the tax sale;




(b)

charges or encumbrances that have been created by this or any other
Act and for which taxes are leviable by the commissioners, but to the
extent only to which taxes are leviable after that;




(c)

existing liens of the government or of the municipality in which the
land is located.




(3)

In a proceeding in court, a deed purporting to be issued for a sale of
land for arrears of taxes, and purporting to be executed under this
Part, is evidence that the deed is the tax sale deed which it purports
to be, and that the sale alleged in the deed was conducted in a fair
and open manner, and that there were taxes due and in default for the
land described in the deed at the time of the sale for which it could
be sold.






Protection of tax sale title




145

(1)


After the expiration of the period allowed by this Part for
redemption,




(a)

an action must not be brought to recover the land sold at a tax sale
or to set aside the sale of the land,




(b)

an action must not be brought against the Registrar of Titles, the
Land Title and Survey Authority of British Columbia or the minister
charged with the administration of the

Land Title Act

or against the commissioners for the sale of the land or the issuance
of a certificate of title to it, and




(c)

except as provided in this section, no claim exists against the
commissioners for loss or damage sustained because of the land being
sold.




(2)

A person who at the time of sale was the registered owner of the land
sold, or the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of the
registered owner of the land sold, or any person who at the time of
sale was the holder of a registered interest in or charge on the land
must be indemnified by the commissioners for any loss or damage
sustained by the person on account of the sale of the land in any of
the following circumstances:




(a)

if the land was not liable to taxation for the period for which the
taxes for which the land was sold were levied;




(b)

if the taxes for which the land was sold had previously been paid;




(c)

if notice was not given as required by section 140.




(3)

There is no right to indemnity under subsection (2) if it is shown
that the person claiming indemnity was aware at the time of the tax
sale that the land was advertised or offered for sale, or was aware
during the period allowed for redemption that the land had been sold.






Tax sale of Crown land held under lease or agreement of sale




146

(1)


In this section,
"Crown"
includes any minister of the Crown, or a board or corporation holding
or having charge of the administration of land on behalf of the Crown.




(2)

If the fee simple of the land for which taxes are in default is in the
Crown, either in right of British Columbia or in right of Canada, and
the land is held by a lessee or purchaser under lease or agreement for
sale from the Crown, sections 130 to 145 apply with the
necessary changes, but the commissioners must sell the land subject to
the interest of the Crown.




(3)

The commissioners must expressly state at the time of a sale to which
subsection (2) refers that the interest of the Crown has priority over
all claims and is not affected by the sale, and the certificate given
by the commissioners to the tax sale purchaser must contain a similar
statement.




(4)

The Crown may accept the tax sale purchaser as the lessee or purchaser
of the land and deal with the tax sale purchaser to the exclusion of
the lessee or purchaser whose interest has been sold, and of every
person claiming under that lessee or purchaser.




(5)

On the acceptance of the tax sale purchaser under this section, the
Crown must notify the commissioners accordingly, and, if the lease or
agreement for sale has been registered, must also notify the Registrar
of Titles.




(6)

If the Crown refuses to accept the tax sale purchaser, or fails to
notify the commissioners of its acceptance within 6 months from
the date of sale, the purchaser is entitled to rescind the sale and to
receive a refund from the commissioners of the amount paid by the
purchaser, with interest at the rate of 8% per year.




(7)

On the refund being made, the commissioners must replace on their tax
roll as taxes in default for the land sold the amount of the taxes,
interest, costs and expenses, together with the amount of interest
paid to the purchaser under this section.






Absolute forfeiture at end of redemption period




147

(1)


If land that has become subject to forfeiture to the commissioners is
not redeemed within the period allowed for its redemption, as stated
in the notice given by the commissioners under section 140, it is
at the expiration of that period, absolutely forfeited to and vested
in the commissioners, free from all encumbrances, other than the
following:




(a)

the restrictive conditions, reservations and exceptions subject to
which the land was held at the time of the tax sale;




(b)

charges or encumbrances on it that have been created under this or any
other Act and for which taxes are leviable by the commissioners, but
to the extent only to which taxes are leviable after that;




(c)

existing liens of the government or of the municipality in which the
land is located.




(2)

The commissioners must issue a certificate to that effect in
duplicate, and must forward one of the duplicates to the registrar of
the land title district in which the land is located with an
application on behalf of the commissioners for registration, and with
the sum of $5 to cover registration fees, and the registrar must at
once register the commissioners as owners and must issue to them a
certificate of indefeasible title.




(3)

When the commissioners have issued the certificate they must cancel on
the tax roll all taxes due for the land, noting on it that the land
has been forfeited to the commissioners.




(4)

The registration of the commissioners as owners of the land forfeited
cancels any certificate of title outstanding for that land, and purges
and disencumbers the land of and from all the right, title and
interest of every previous owner of it, or of those claiming under a
previous owner, and of and from all claims, demands, payments,
charges, liens, judgments, mortgages and encumbrances of every nature
and kind, other than the following:




(a)

the restrictive conditions, reservations and exceptions subject to
which the land was held at the time of the tax sale;




(b)

charges or encumbrances on it that have been created under this or any
other Act and for which taxes are leviable by the commissioners, but
to the extent only to which taxes are leviable after that;




(c)

existing liens of the government or of the municipality in which the
land is located.




(5)

The commissioners may lease, sell or otherwise dispose of forfeited
land of which they have been registered as owners, in a manner and on
terms they see fit, and may apply the proceeds of sale for any purpose
for which taxes leviable by the commissioners under this Part may be
applied.






Power of commissioners to redeem land forfeited or sold for Provincial
or municipal taxes




148

(1)


If land located in a district has become subject to forfeiture to the
government, or has been sold by a Provincial or municipal collector to
a person or to the municipality in which the land is located under any
Act for the recovery of Provincial or municipal taxes, and if there
are taxes in arrears under this Part for the land, the commissioners
may redeem the land at any time during the period allowed for
redemption of it by paying to the Provincial or municipal collector
the amount required to redeem it as provided in the Act under which
the land became subject to forfeiture or was sold.




(2)

On the redemption of land by the commissioners under this section,
they may add the amount of the payment made by them to the amount of
diking taxes in arrears for the land, and the amount added is deemed
to be taxes in default within the meaning of this Part.




(3)

If land referred to in subsection (1) has not been redeemed, but has
become absolutely forfeited to and vested in the government or has
become vested in the municipality, and remains undisposed of, the
commissioners may purchase the land on behalf of the district, at a
price equal to the amount of the upset price at which the land was
offered for sale at the tax sale, together with interest on it at the
rate of 6% per year from the date of the tax sale, and with a sum
equal to the amount of further taxes, and the penalties, and interest
on it that would accrue due up to the time of purchase by the
commissioners had the land been regularly assessed in the same manner
as it appeared on the assessment roll for the year last preceding the
date of its forfeiture or vesting and with a fee of $10 for a grant
from the government or a conveyance from the municipality.




(4)

The minister on behalf of the government, or the municipal council on
behalf of the municipality may sell the land to the commissioners at
the price set out in this subsection.






Power of commissioners to hold and deal with land




149


The commissioners may, for the purpose of the undertaking and with the
approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council




(a)

receive, hold, take and acquire all voluntary grants and donations of
land or other property made to them,




(b)

purchase, hold, take and acquire land or other property from the
government or any other person, and




(c)

mortgage, sell, lease or otherwise alienate and dispose of all or part
of the land or other property referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).






Investment of sinking funds




150

(1)


The commissioners must hold and invest, in those investments in which
trustees are by law authorized to invest trust funds, in their own
names or in the names of the trustee appointed under section 119,
all money raised by taxes for a sinking fund account for the payment
of any indebtedness at maturity.




(2)

In estimating the amount to accrue on a sinking fund, a higher rate
than 5% on any investment must not be estimated.




(3)

In addition to the investment of the sinking funds authorized in this
Part, they may be invested in the repurchase of debentures or bonds
issued by the commissioners for the district.






Power of lenders to appoint commissioners




151


If the office of a commissioner becomes vacant and is not filled while
money borrowed under this Part is unpaid, the lenders, or their
assignees, or a majority of them, or the trustee for the bond or
debenture holders, may by writing signed by them and under their seals
appoint a person to act as commissioner, and all the powers and
authorities vested in a commissioner by this Part vest in that
commissioner.






Power of Lieutenant Governor in Council to appoint and dismiss
commissioners




152

(1)


If the commissioners neglect to enforce the payment of the money
borrowed under the powers vested in them in accordance with the
conditions on which it was borrowed, the lenders or their assignees,
or a majority of them, or the trustee for the bond or debenture
holders, may apply to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to appoint
commissioners instead of the ones then acting.




(2)

If the commissioners delay for 4 weeks to pay the payments due on
the money borrowed, the Lieutenant Governor in Council may dismiss the
commissioners and appoint new ones in their place, and all the powers
and authorities vested in the commissioners dismissed then devolve on
and vest in the newly appointed commissioners.






Procedure on claims against commissioners




153


Any writ of execution on a judgment against the commissioners must be
endorsed with a direction to the sheriff to levy the amount of it by a
levy, and the following rules apply to the proceedings on the writ of
execution:




(a)

the sheriff must deliver a copy of the writ and endorsement to the
clerk of the commissioners, with a statement in writing of the
sheriff's fees and of the amount required to satisfy the execution,
including in the amount the interest calculated to a day as near as is
convenient to the day of service;




(b)

if the amount, with interest on it from the day mentioned in the
statement, is not paid to the sheriff within one month after the
service, the sheriff must examine the plan and assessment roll filed,
and must, in the same manner as taxes are levied by the commissioners
for general purposes, make a levy, based on and in accordance with the
assessment roll, sufficient to cover the amount due on the execution,
with the addition to it of the interest, the sheriff's own fees and
the collector's percentage up to the time when the taxes will probably
be available;




(c)

the sheriff must then issue precepts directed to the clerk of the
commissioners, and must annex to every precept the roll of the rate,
and must by the precept, after reciting the writ, and that the
commissioners have neglected to satisfy it, and referring to the plan
filed under section 72, command the clerk to levy the rate at
once on the land shown in that plan;




(d)

if at the time the rate is levied a general rate roll is delivered to
the clerk, the clerk must add a column to it, headed "Execution Rate
in A.B. vs. Commissioners", and must insert in it the amount in the
precept required to be levied on each person, and must levy the amount
of the execution rate, and must, with all reasonable expedition,
return to the sheriff the precept with the amount levied on it, after
deducting the percentage for collection;




(e)

the sheriff must satisfy the execution and all fees on it, and pay the
surplus, if any, to the clerk for the general purposes of the
commissioners within 10 days after receiving it;




(f)

all employees of the commissioners are, for all purposes connected
with the sheriff levying a rate to satisfy an execution, deemed to be
officers of the court out of which the writ was issued, and are
amenable to the court, and may be proceeded against by attachment or
otherwise to compel them to perform the duties imposed on them, and a
judge of the court out of which execution issues may make an order as
necessary for carrying out these provisions.






Owner of land may appeal to judge




154

(1)


If an owner, or a bond or debenture holder or creditor of the
commissioners, feels aggrieved by the proceedings or by any omission
or default of the commissioners, or of any person under this Part, or
liable to be prejudiced, the owner, bond or debenture holder or
creditor of the commissioners may appeal to a judge in a summary
manner on a summons to be granted, if thought expedient, by the judge,
and the order may be made as the judge thinks proper.




(2)

Nothing in this section in any way restricts, prejudices or affects
any right or remedy that an owner or other person would have had in
the absence of this section.






Inspection by engineer appointed by Lieutenant Governor in Council




155

(1)


The Lieutenant Governor in Council may, at the request of the
commissioners, or at the request of any persons holding debentures or
bonds issued by the commissioners, appoint a civil engineer or other
properly qualified person to inspect and examine the works in any
drainage or diking district.




(2)

Any repairs or precautionary measures that the engineer or other
person may consider urgent must be carried out at once by the
commissioners, and at the expense of the owners.




(3)

In the case of default by the commissioners or extreme urgency, the
engineer or other person may, on behalf of the commissioners, carry
out the repairs or measures as the agent of the commissioners, and
must at once notify the commissioners of the expenditure.




(4)

The remuneration and expenses of the engineer or other person must be
levied by the commissioners on the land and on the owners of it under
this Part.






Application of Part to districts formed before March 1, 1913




156

(1)


If a drainage or diking district was formed before March 1, 1913,
the commissioners holding office at that date are from that date
corporations under the name of Commissioners of the .............
District, using the name by which the district is known, and those
commissioners have all the rights, powers and authorities given to
commissioners appointed under this Part, and the land coloured green
on the plans filed in the land title office by the commissioners under
the Acts until then in force constitute the respective districts of
the commissioners.




(2)

Any assessment roll made and filed and taxes levied by commissioners
before March 1, 1913 continue to be a binding charge on the land
to which it refers, despite a defect either in the appointment of the
commissioners or in proceedings taken by them.




(3)

The commissioners for any district may levy taxes under
section 81 as necessary, and those taxes must be based on and
must be in accordance with the assessment roll made and filed, which
continues to be the assessment roll for the district to which it
refers until the commissioners of the district make a new assessment
roll under this Part.






Part applicable although land in municipality




157


This Part applies whether or not all or a part of the land affected is
included within the limits of any incorporated municipality.






Damage to dike




158

(1)


If a dike or other portion of any works executed is injured by an
owner or occupier in the district pasturing cattle or horses on
marshes or other land adjacent to the dike, or making a road over the
dike, or interfering with or breaking any watercourse constructed by
the commissioners, or by any other act or default of an owner or
occupier, the commissioners may make an order on that person as often
as occasion requires to repair the injury at once or by a certain day
to be named in the order, and in the case of a refusal to obey the
order, or in case the commissioners consider it to be one of sudden
emergency, the commissioners must repair the injury.




(2)

A person who contravenes the order of the commissioners must forfeit
and pay to the commissioners for every offence a sum of not more
than $50, which, with the costs of repair, may be recovered by
suit in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the
commissioners.




(3)

In the case of an emergency the commissioners may recover from the
person causing or allowing the injury to be done the costs of repair,
which must be recovered as a debt due to the commissioners in a court
of competent jurisdiction.






Wilful injury to works




159


If a person in any manner wilfully injures works executed under this
Part or interferes with the commissioners in carrying out the works
authorized under this Part, the person must forfeit for each offence a
sum of not more than $50, together with the costs of the repair,
which may be recovered on summary conviction before a justice.






Commissioners not liable for acts of predecessors




160


A commissioner is not liable for an act of the commissioner's
predecessor in office, about work in which the commissioner is
engaged, except for money the commissioner might or could have
collected on account of work done by the predecessor.






How notice is to be given




161


Except as otherwise directed by this Part, a notice required to be
given must be a written notice served on the parties in person, or
left at their last known place of residence, or sent by registered
letter mailed to their last address.
