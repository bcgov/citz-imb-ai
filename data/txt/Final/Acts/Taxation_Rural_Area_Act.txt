(12)


If persons carry on business in partnership, the demand under subsection (1), (2) or (3) may be addressed to the partnership name and, in the case of personal service, is deemed to have been validly served if it was served on one of the partners or left with an adult person employed at the place of business of the partnership.

(3)


If the property distrained is sold for more than the taxes and costs and no claim to the surplus is made by another person, on the ground that the property sold belonged to the other person or that the other person was entitled by lien or other right to the surplus, the surplus must be paid to the person in whose possession the property was when the distress was made and that person's receipt taken.






(4)


If a claim is made by the person for whose taxes the property was distrained, and the claim is admitted, the surplus must be paid to the claimant and the claimant's receipt taken.
