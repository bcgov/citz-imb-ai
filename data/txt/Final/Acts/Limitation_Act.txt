In the case of a claim for payment of a liquidated sum, part payment of the sum by the person against whom the claim is or may be made or by the person's agent is an acknowledgement by the person against whom the claim is or may be made of liability in respect of the claim.






(8)


A debtor's performance of an obligation under or in respect of a security agreement is an acknowledgement by the debtor of liability in respect of a claim by the creditor for realization on the collateral under the security agreement.






(9)


A creditor's acceptance of a debtor's payment or performance of an obligation under or in respect of a security agreement is an acknowledgement by the creditor of liability in respect of a claim by the debtor for redemption of the collateral under the security agreement.
