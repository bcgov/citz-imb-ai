If information or a record is capable of being retrieved and processed by an addressee, the information or record in electronic form is deemed, unless the contrary is proven, to be received by the addressee

(2)


If a right is to be granted to or an obligation is to be acquired by one person and no other person and a provision of an enactment requires that, in order to do so, the right or obligation must be conveyed to that person by the transfer or use of a record in writing, that requirement is satisfied if the right or obligation is conveyed through the use of one or more records in electronic form created by a method that gives reliable assurance that the right or obligation has become the right or obligation of that person and no other person.






(3)


For the purposes of subsection (2), the standard of reliability required must be assessed in view of the purpose for which the right or obligation was conveyed and any other relevant circumstances, including any relevant agreement.

(5)


A record in writing issued in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (4) must contain a statement of the termination, and the replacement of the records in electronic form by records in writing does not affect the rights or obligations of the parties involved.






(6)


If a law is compulsorily applicable to a contract of carriage of goods that is set out in, or is evidenced by, a record in writing, that law is not inapplicable to a contract of carriage of goods that is evidenced by one or more records in electronic form by reason solely that the contract is evidenced by records in electronic form rather than by a record in writing.
