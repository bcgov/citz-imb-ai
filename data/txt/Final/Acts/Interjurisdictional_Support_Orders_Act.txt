complete a support application that includes the following:






(a)


the name and address for service of the claimant;

Preparing support application — provisional order
required

If a claimant






(a)


resides in British Columbia, and






(b)


believes that the respondent habitually resides in a reciprocating
jurisdiction that requires a provisional order,


a court in British Columbia may, on application by the claimant and without
notice to and in the absence of the respondent, make a provisional order taking into
account the legal authority on which the claimant's application for support is
based.






(2)

jurisdiction, with information that the respondent named in the support application

notify the appropriate authority in the originating reciprocating

must adjourn the hearing, and

may make an interim support order.

requested under subsection (2) within 12 months after the request is made, it may

resides.

If the respondent does not appear as required in the notice served on the
respondent under section 9 (1) (b) (ii), or does not provide the information or

registry must send a copy of the order to the respondent.

On receiving an eligible copy of an order under section 17 (2), the British
Columbia court must register it as an order of that court.






(2)


On an order being registered under subsection (1), the order, from
the date it is registered, has the same effect as a support order made by a court in
British Columbia.






(3)


Subject to section 19, an order registered under subsection (1) may
be enforced, with respect both to arrears accrued before registration and obligations
accruing after registration, in the same manner as a support order made by a court in
British Columbia, or may be varied under this Act.






(4)


Subject to section 19, an order registered under subsection (1) may
be filed with the director.






(4.1)


Unless otherwise stated in the order, if an order registered under subsection (1)
creates an obligation to pay support, the duration of that obligation is governed by the
law of the jurisdiction under which law the order was made.






(4.2)


Despite subsection (4.1), if the director is unable to determine the duration of the
obligation to pay support based on information received from the person seeking to have
the order enforced in British Columbia or from the reciprocating jurisdiction, the
director may apply British Columbia law to determine the duration of the obligation to
pay support.






(5)


This section applies to a registered order whether it is made before, on or
after the date this section comes into force.








Foreign orders after registration





19



(1)


After registration of a foreign order under section 18, the British Columbia
court registry must send notice of the registration

indirectly, in the prescribed manner, to the party required to pay support
under the order, and

to every other party to the order who resides in British Columbia.

receive notice of the registration in the other province.







(3)

may

confirm the registration, or

a party to the foreign order did not have proper notice or a reasonable
opportunity to be heard in the proceeding in which the foreign order was
made,






(ii)


the foreign order is contrary to the public policy of British Columbia,
or

the court or administrative body that made the foreign order did not have
jurisdiction to make the order.

British Columbia court determines that

both parties to the foreign order habitually resided in the reciprocating
jurisdiction outside Canada, or

a party did not habitually reside in the reciprocating jurisdiction outside
Canada but was, under British Columbia's conflict of law rules, subject to the
jurisdiction of the foreign court or administrative body that made the foreign
order.






(5)


A British Columbia court that sets aside the registration under subsection (3)
must record the reasons for its decision.






(6)


The British Columbia court must give notice of its decision or order, and
written reasons, if any, to the party that did not request the registration, and the
designated authority.








Effect of setting aside registration of foreign orders





20



(1)


If the registration of a foreign order is set aside under section 19, the
foreign order must be dealt with under this Act as if it were a document corresponding
to a support application received under section 9 (1) or a support
variation application received under section 29 (1).






(2)


If the foreign order does not contain the necessary information or documents
required for a support application or a support variation application, the designated
authority must request the necessary information and documents from the party who
applied to register the order or the appropriate authority of the reciprocating
jurisdiction that requested the registration.

RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT


Article 19


Scope of the Chapter

settlement or agreement concluded before or approved by such an authority. A decision may
include automatic adjustment by indexation and a requirement to pay arrears, retroactive

obligations.

whose decisions, under the law of the State where it is established —

same matter.

30.

recognised and enforced in other Contracting States if —






(a)


the respondent was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time
proceedings were instituted;






(b)


the respondent has submitted to the jurisdiction either expressly or by
defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first
available opportunity;






(c)


the creditor was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time
proceedings were instituted;

the child for whom maintenance was ordered was habitually resident in the State
of origin at the time proceedings were instituted, provided that the respondent has
lived with the child in that State or has resided in that State and provided support for
the child there;






(e)


except in disputes relating to maintenance obligations in respect of children,
there has been agreement to the jurisdiction in writing by the parties; or

the decision was made by an authority exercising jurisdiction on a matter of
personal status or parental responsibility, unless that jurisdiction was based solely on
the nationality of one of the parties.













2.



A Contracting State may make a reservation, in accordance with Article 62, in
respect of paragraph 1 c), e) or f).













3.



A Contracting State making a reservation under paragraph 2 shall recognise and
enforce a decision if its law would in similar factual circumstances confer or would have
conferred jurisdiction on its authorities to make such a decision.

A Contracting State shall, if recognition of a decision is not possible as a
result of a reservation under paragraph 2, and if the debtor is habitually resident in
that State, take all appropriate measures to establish a decision for the benefit of the
creditor. The preceding sentence shall not apply to direct requests for recognition and
enforcement under Article 19(5) or to claims for support referred to in Article 2(1)
b).













5.



A decision in favour of a child under the age of 18 years which cannot be
recognised by virtue only of a reservation in respect of paragraph 1 c), e) or f) shall be
accepted as establishing the eligibility of that child for maintenance in the State
addressed.













6.



A decision shall be recognised only if it has effect in the State of origin, and
shall be enforced only if it is enforceable in the State of origin.



Article 21


Severability and partial recognition and enforcement












1.



If the State addressed is unable to recognise or enforce the whole of the
decision, it shall recognise or enforce any severable part of the decision which can be so
recognised or enforced.













2.



Partial recognition or enforcement of a decision can always be applied
for.

procedure;

enforcement in the State addressed;






(e)


in a case where the respondent has neither appeared nor was represented in
proceedings in the State of origin —

when the law of the State of origin provides for notice of proceedings, the
respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be
heard; or

Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations

Hague Convention of 1 March 1954 on
civil procedure

which contain provisions on matters governed by the Convention, with a view to improving

Article 52


Most effective rule












1.



This Convention shall not prevent the application of an agreement, arrangement or

Transitional provisions

a direct request for recognition and enforcement has been received by the
competent authority of the State addressed after the Convention has entered into force
between the State of origin and the State addressed.













2.



With regard to the recognition and enforcement of decisions between Contracting
States to this Convention that are also Parties to either of the Hague Maintenance
Conventions mentioned in Article 48, if the conditions for the recognition and enforcement
under this Convention prevent the recognition and enforcement of a decision given in the
State of origin before the entry into force of this Convention for that State, that would

effect at the time the decision was rendered, the conditions of that Convention shall
apply.

or a maintenance arrangement, in respect of payments falling due prior to the entry into

respecting child support obligations towards persons who are 21 years of age or older and
are unable, by reason of illness, disability or other cause, including but not limited to
enrolment in a full-time program of education, to withdraw from their parents' charge or
to obtain the necessaries of life, this Act, with necessary modifications, and the
definition of

"child"

as set out in Part 7 of the

Act

apply to such applications.








Declaration respecting the applicability of the convention to applications
for spousal support only

3



If Canada makes a reservation with respect to British Columbia under article 20
(2) of the convention in respect of article 20 (1) (c), (e) and (f), none of the following
