Mitigation measures





16



(1)


If the decision maker considers that the diversion and use of water, or changes in and about a stream, proposed by an application for an authorization, or the changes in and about a stream proposed to be made under a change approval, are likely to have a significant adverse impact on the water quality, water quantity or aquatic ecosystem of a stream or aquifer, a stream channel or other uses of water from the stream or aquifer to which the application relates, the decision maker may






(a)


require that the applicant submit a proposal for mitigation measures to address those effects, which mitigation measures must meet prescribed criteria, if any, and






(b)


impose under section 14 (1) (f)

[powers respecting applications and decision maker initiatives]

terms and conditions requiring implementation of the proposed mitigation measures if those measures meet the prescribed criteria.






(2)


If the decision maker considers that the effects described in subsection (1) cannot be addressed, or cannot be fully addressed, by mitigation measures proposed by the applicant but can be compensated for by other mitigation measures taken on a different part of the stream or aquifer than the part to which the proposal relates, the decision maker may impose under section 14 (1) (f) terms and conditions requiring the applicant to take compensatory mitigation measures that meet the prescribed criteria, in place of or supplemental to any mitigation measures proposed by the applicant, on a different part of the stream or aquifer to which the application relates.






(3)


With the consent of the applicant, the terms and conditions of an authorization or change approval may require that the applicant take compensatory mitigation measures on a different stream or aquifer than the stream or aquifer in respect of which the application is made.








Sensitive streams mitigation





17



(1)


If an application for an authorization or a change approval, or an amendment to an authorization or change approval, is in relation to a sensitive stream, the decision maker






(a)


may require that the applicant provide the prescribed plans, specifications, reports of assessments or other information, in addition to the other information required under this Act in relation to the application, and

(a)


if satisfied that






(i)


any adverse impact, resulting from granting the application, on the sustainability of any protected fish population of the sensitive stream is likely to be insignificant,






(ii)


the mitigation measures proposed by the applicant, if carried out, would ensure that granting the application is not likely to cause a significant adverse impact on any protected fish population or the aquatic ecosystem of the sensitive stream, or






(iii)


compensatory mitigation measures that meet any prescribed criteria, whether or not proposed by the applicant, if carried out, in place of or supplemental to the proposed mitigation measures, will enhance or enable the enhancement of an aquatic ecosystem elsewhere that will fully compensate for the significant adverse impact on that protected fish population or aquatic ecosystem resulting from granting the application, and






(b)


if, in the circumstances described in paragraph (a) (ii), the decision maker imposes implementation of the mitigation measures, and in the circumstances described in paragraph (a) (iii), the decision maker imposes implementation of the compensatory mitigation measures, as terms and conditions of the authorization or change approval or amended authorization or change approval, as applicable.

[Not in force.]








Licences for power purposes





19



(1)


In this section:



"operational term"

means the period beginning when






(a)


the activities described in the definition of "project development term" are completed, or






(b)


the period authorized for completion of those activities has ended,


whichever occurs earlier, during which power is, or is authorized to be, produced under a licence issued for a power purpose and during which a storage purpose authorized by a licence in relation to the power purpose may be exercised;



"project development term"

means the period, following the issue of a licence for a power purpose but before the beginning of the operational term, during which activities required to prepare for power production under the licence are performed, including, without limitation, project design and engineering, securing construction and other contracts and constructing works.






(2)


This section applies to






(a)


a licence issued for a power purpose on or after October 23, 2003, unless the licence is being issued in substitution for a licence that did not specify the term of the licence and was issued for a power purpose before that date,






(b)


a licence that is being amended, whether or not the licence is replaced, if






(i)


the licence was issued for a power purpose before October 23, 2003 and specified the term of licence, and






(ii)


the amendment is for the purpose of extending the term of the licence, or






(c)


a licence that is being amended, whether or not the licence is replaced, if

(8)


Despite subsection (3), if an application is made under subsection (5), the licence does not expire until the later of






(a)


the date the decision maker decides on the application, and






(b)


the expiry date of the operational term of the licence.






(9)


If a licensee fails to apply to renew a licence to which this section applies before the expiry of the operational term of the licence and the failure, in the opinion of the decision maker, is not the fault of the licensee, the decision maker may extend the expiry date for not more than 6 months from the original expiry date and, if the expiry date is extended, the licence is deemed to be and to have been continuously in force from the date of issue until the new expiry date.






(10)


Subsection (9) does not apply to a licence for which the expiry date has been extended under that subsection.






(11)

(a)


that, except in relation to a licence that is required to be registered under the


Water Protection Act


, is located entirely in British Columbia,






(b)


that consists of land, a mine or an undertaking, or any combination of those things, and






(c)


that is adequately described in the licence.






(2)


A decision maker who issues a use approval, change approval, permit or drilling authorization may specify an appurtenancy that meets the requirements of subsection (1) as the appurtenancy of the use approval, change approval, permit or drilling authorization, as applicable.






(3)


The decision maker must ensure that every authorization that the decision maker issues






(a)


specifies the date of precedence of the rights under the authorization,






(b)


specifies the maximum quantity of water that may be diverted and used for each water use purpose authorized by the authorization, and






(c)


is for the diversion of water for one or more water use purposes and those water use purposes are specified in the authorization.








When final licence may be issued





21



(1)


On application under section 12

[application and decision maker initiative procedures]

, or on the comptroller's or water manager's own initiative, the comptroller or a water manager may issue to the holder of a conditional licence a final licence authorizing the diversion or use of the quantity of water that the decision maker determines to have been beneficially used for the water uses purposes authorized under, and during the term of, the conditional licence, when






(a)


the licensee completes the works, or






(b)


the period for completing the works expires and, if any works have not been completed, the decision maker determines that the works that have not been completed are not required.






(2)


On the issue of a final licence, the conditional licence it replaces has no further effect.








Precedence of rights





22



(1)


The rights exercisable under an authorization that authorizes the diversion of water from a stream have precedence in relation to the rights of other authorization holders who divert water from






(a)


the stream,






(b)


a tributary of the stream, or






(c)


an aquifer the decision maker considers is reasonably likely to be hydraulically connected to that stream


according to the dates set out in the authorizations as the dates from which the rights take precedence.






(2)


The rights exercisable under authorizations described in subsection (1) that have precedence from the same date have precedence in accordance with the ranking under subsection (7) of the water use purposes in respect of which the authorizations are issued.






(3)


The rights exercisable under authorizations described in subsection (1) have equal precedence if the rights have precedence from the same date and are for the same water use purpose.






(4)


The rights exercisable under an authorization that authorizes the diversion of water from an aquifer have precedence in relation to the rights of other authorization holders who divert water from the aquifer, or another aquifer the decision maker considers is reasonably likely to be hydraulically connected to that aquifer, according to the date set out in the authorization as the date from which the rights take precedence.






(5)


The rights exercisable under authorizations described in subsection (4) that have precedence from the same date have precedence in accordance with the ranking under subsection (7) of the water use purposes in respect of which the authorizations are issued.






(6)


The rights exercisable under authorizations described in subsection (4) have equal precedence if the rights have precedence from the same date and are for the same water use purpose.






(7)


For the purposes of subsections (2) and (5), water use purposes are ranked, from highest to lowest as follows:






(a)


domestic;






(b)


waterworks;






(c)


irrigation;

mineralized water;






(e)


mining;






(f)


industrial;






(g)


oil and gas;






(h)


power;






(i)


storage;






(j)


conservation;






(k)


land improvement.






(8)


Despite subsections (1) to (6), a person to whom section 6 (4)

[use of water — excluded groundwater users]

applies is deemed to have rights that have precedence under those subsections, as if the deemed rights were granted under an authorization that






(a)


sets out as the date of precedence the date of first use of the water, and






(b)


authorizes the use of the greater of






(i)


2 000 litres of water per day for each private dwelling on a parcel, or






(ii)


the amount of water the engineer is satisfied the person has been using for domestic purposes.






(9)


Despite subsections (1) to (8), if an order under section 86 (1) or (3)

[declarations of significant water shortage]

applies to a stream and the comptroller has determined the critical environmental flow threshold for the stream under section 87 (1)

[critical environmental flow protection orders]

, the amount of that critical environmental flow threshold for the stream has precedence over the rights






(a)


under any authorization issued in relation to the stream or a hydraulically connected aquifer referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or






(b)


of a person described in subsection (8) of this section.






(10)


Despite subsections (1) to (9), if an engineer is taking action to enforce the precedence of rights to divert or use water from a stream or aquifer, a person must not be prohibited from diverting water from the stream or aquifer for essential household use.






(11)


For the purposes of this section,

"essential household use"

means the use by the occupants of one private dwelling of not more than 250 litres of water per day for






(a)


drinking water, food preparation and sanitation, and






(b)


providing water to animals or poultry that are kept






(i)


for household use, or
