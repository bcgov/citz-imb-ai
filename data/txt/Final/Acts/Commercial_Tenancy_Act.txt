Commercial Tenancy Act


[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER								57










Payment by execution creditor of rent before removal of chattels taken in        execution





1



No chattels being in or on any land that is or shall be leased for life or lives,
term of years, or at will, or otherwise, are liable to be taken by virtue of any execution,
unless the party at whose suit the said execution is sued out, before the removal of such
chattels from the premises, by virtue of such execution or extent, pays to the landlord of
the premises or the landlord's bailiff such sum of money as is due for rent for the premises
at the time of the taking of the chattels by virtue of the execution, if the arrears of rent
do not amount to more than one year's rent; and in case the said arrears exceed one year's
rent, then the party at whose suit such execution is sued out, paying the said landlord or
bailiff one year's rent, may proceed to execute the party's judgment, as the party might have
done heretofore; and the sheriff or other officer is empowered and required to levy and pay
to the plaintiff as well the money so paid for rent as the execution money.








Action against tenant for life for rent





2



Any person having any rent in arrear or due on any lease or demise for life or lives
may recover such arrears of rent by action as if such rent were due and reserved on a lease
for years.








Rent in arrear on a lease expired may be distrained for after determination
of lease





3



Any person having any rent in arrear or due on any lease for life or lives, or for
years, or at will, ended or determined, may distrain for such arrears, after the
determination of the said respective leases, in the same manner as the person might have done
if such lease or leases had not been ended or determined.








Provided distress be made within 6 months after determination of
lease





4



Distress under section 3 shall be made within the space of 6 calendar
months after the determination of the lease, and during the continuance of the landlord's
title or interest, and during the possession of the tenant from whom the arrears became
due.








Provision for landlords where tenants desert premises





5



And whereas landlords are often sufferers by tenants running away in arrear, and not
only suffering the demised premises to lie uncultivated without any distress thereon,
whereby their landlords might be satisfied for the rent-arrear, but also refusing to deliver
up the possession of the demised premises, whereby the landlords are put to the expense and
delay of recovering in ejectment: Be it enacted —




That if any tenant holding any land at a rack-rent, or where the rent reserved is
full three-fourths of the yearly value of the demised premises, who is in arrear for one
year's rent, deserts the demised premises and leaves the same uncultivated or unoccupied,
so as no sufficient distress can be had to countervail the arrears of rent, it is lawful
for 2 or more Justices of the Peace of the county, district or place, at the request of
the landlord or the landlord's bailiff or agent, to go on and view the same, and to affix,
or cause to be affixed on the most conspicuous part of the premises notice in writing what
day (not less than 14 days thereafter) they will return to take a second view thereof; and
if on such second view the tenant, or some person on the tenant's behalf, does not appear,
and pay the rent in arrear, or there is not sufficient distress on the premises, then the
said justices may put the landlord into the possession of the said demised premises, and
the lease thereof to such tenant, as to any demise therein contained only, shall from
thenceforth become void.








Tenants may appeal from justices





6



Proceedings under section 5 are subject to review in a summary way by any
judge of the Supreme Court, who may order restitution to be made to the tenant together with
the tenant's expenses and costs, to be paid by the landlord, or to make such order as the
judge shall think fit; and in case the judge affirms the act of the justices, the judge may
award such costs of appeal in favour of the landlord as may seem just.








Method of recovering rentseck





7



Every person shall and may have the like remedy by distress and by impounding and
selling the same, in cases of rentseck, rents of assize, and chief rents, as in case of
rents reserved on lease, any law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.








Chief leases may be renewed without surrendering all
underleases





8



(1)


In case any lease is duly surrendered in order to be renewed, and a new lease made
and executed by the chief landlord, the same new lease is, without a surrender of any of
the underleases, as valid as if all the underleases derived from it had been likewise
surrendered at or before the taking of such new lease.






(2)


Every person in whom any estate for life or lives, or for years, is from time to
time vested by virtue of the new lease, and the person's personal representatives, are
entitled to the rents, covenants and duties, and shall have like remedy for recovery
thereof, and underlessees shall hold and enjoy the land in the respective underleases
comprised as if the original leases out of which the respective underleases are derived
had been still kept on foot and continued.






(3)


The chief landlord shall have and is entitled to such and the same remedy, by
distress or entry in and on the land comprised in the underlease, for the rents and duties
reserved by the new lease, so far as the same exceed not the rents and duties reserved in
the lease out of which such underlease was derived, as the chief landlord would have had
in case the former lease had been still continued, or as the chief landlord would have had
in case the respective underlease had been renewed under the new principal
lease.








Rents, how to be recovered where demises are not by deed





9



(1)


It is lawful for the landlord, where the agreement is not by deed, to recover by
action in any court of competent jurisdiction a reasonable satisfaction for the land held,
used or occupied by the defendant for the use and occupation thereof.






(2)


If at the trial of the action it appears that any rent has been reserved by a
parol, demise, or any agreement (not being by deed), such rent may be the measure of the
damages to be recovered by the plaintiff.








Rents recoverable from undertenant where tenants for life die before rent is
payable





10



Where any tenant for life dies before or on the day on which any rent was reserved
or made payable on any demise or lease of any land which determined on the death of the
tenant for life, the personal representatives of the tenant for life shall and may recover
from any undertenant or undertenants of the land if the tenant for life dies on the day on
which the same was made payable, the whole, or if before such day then a proportion, of the
rent according to the time the tenant for life lived, of the last year or quarter of a year,
or other time in which the rent was growing due as aforesaid, making all just allowances or
a proportionable part thereof respectively.








Certain other rents to be considered as within provisions of section
10





11



Rents reserved and made payable on any demise or lease of land determinable on the
death of the person making the same (although such person was not strictly tenant for life
thereof) or on the death of the life or lives for which the person was entitled to the land,
shall, so far as respects the rents reserved by the lease, and the recovery of a proportion
thereof by the person granting the same, the person's personal representatives, be considered
as within the provisions of section 10.








Apportionment and recovery of rents, annuities, and payments due at fixed
periods





12



All rents-service hereafter reserved on any lease by a tenant in fee or for any life
interest, or by any lease granted under any power, and all rents-charge and other rents,
annuities, pension, dividends, moduses, compositions, and all other payments of every
description, made payable or coming due at fixed periods under any instrument that is
hereafter executed, or (being a will or testamentary instrument) that comes into operation
hereafter, shall be apportioned in such manner that on the death of any person interested in
any such rents, annuities, pensions, dividends, moduses, compositions, or other payments as
aforesaid, or in the estate, fund, office, or benefice from or in respect of which the same
are issuing or derived, or on the determination by any other means of the interest of any
such person, the person and the person's personal representatives, or assignees shall be
entitled to a proportion of such rents, annuities, pensions, dividends, moduses,
compositions, and other payments according to the time which has elapsed from the
commencement or last period of payment thereof respectively (as the case may be), including
the day of the death of the person or of the determination of the person's interest, all just
allowances and deductions in respect of charges on such rents, annuities, pensions,
dividends, moduses, compositions, and other payments being made; and that every such person,
the person's personal representatives, and assignees, shall have the same remedies for
recovering such apportioned parts of the said rents, annuities, pensions, dividends,
moduses, compositions, and other payments, when the entire portion of which such apportioned
parts form part becomes due and payable, and not before, as the person, the person's personal representatives or the person's assignees would have had
for recovering such entire rents, annuities, pensions, dividends, moduses, compositions, and
other payments if entitled thereto, but so that persons liable to pay rents reserved by any
lease or demise, and the land comprised therein, shall not be resorted to for such
apportioned parts specifically as aforesaid, but the entire rents of which such portions
shall form a part shall be received and recovered by the person who but for this section
would have been entitled to such entire rents; and such portions shall be recoverable in any
action from such person by the party entitled to the same under this Act.








Saving effect of express contracts





13



Sections 11 and 12 do not apply to any case in which it is expressly stipulated that no
apportionment shall take place, or to annual sums made payable in policies of
assurance.








All grants and conveyances to be good, without attornment of
tenants





14



All grants and conveyances heretofore or hereafter made of any real estate or rents,
or of the reversion or remainder of any land, are good and effectual without any attornment
of any tenant of any such land out of which such rent shall be issuing, or of the particular
tenants on whose particular estates any such reversions or remainders shall and may be
expectant or depending, as if their attornment had been had and made; but no such tenant
shall be prejudiced or damaged by payment of any rent to any such grantor, or by breach of
any condition for nonpayment of rent, before the notice is given to the tenant of such grant
by the grantee.








Persons holding over land after expiration of lease to pay double yearly
value





15



In case any tenant for any term of life, lives, or years or other person who comes
into possession of any land by, from, or under, or by collusion with the tenant, wilfully
holds over any land after the determination of any such term, and after demand made and
notice in writing given for delivering the possession thereof by the landlord or lessor, or
the person to whom the remainder or reversion of such land belongs, or that person's agent
thereunto lawfully authorized, then and in such case the person so holding over shall, for
and during the time the person holds over or keeps the person entitled out of possession of
the land pay to the person kept out of possession, or that person's personal representatives
or assignees, at the rate of double the yearly value of the land so detained, for so long
time as the same are detained, to be recovered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.








Tenants holding premises after time they notify for quitting them to pay
double rent





16



In case any tenant gives notice of the tenant's intention to quit the premises by the tenant holden at a time mentioned in the notice, and does not deliver up possession thereof
at such time, then the tenant or the tenant's personal representatives shall thenceforward pay
to the landlord double the rent or sum which the tenant shall otherwise have paid; to be
levied and recovered at the same times and in the same manner as the single rent or sum
before giving such notice could be levied or recovered; and such double rent or sum shall
continue to be paid during all the time such tenant shall so continue in
possession.








Definitions for purposes of sections 18 to 28





17



In sections 18 to 28:

annexing a copy of the instrument creating or containing the lease or right of
occupation, if in writing;

setting forth the terms of the lease or occupation, and the reason why a copy cannot be
annexed;






(d)


annexing a copy of the demand made for delivering possession, stating the

(3)


An application under subsection (1) shall be commenced at a registry of the
Supreme Court located in the judicial district where the land is situated.








Court to appoint time and place of inquiry, etc.





19



If after reading the affidavit it appears to the court that the tenant wrongfully
holds and that the landlord is entitled to possession, the court shall appoint a time and
place to inquire and determine whether the person complained of was a tenant of the
complainant for a term or period which has expired, or has been determined by a notice to
quit or otherwise, whether the tenant holds possession against the right of the landlord and
whether the tenant has wrongfully refused to go out of possession, having no right to
continue in possession.








Notice in writing of inquiry





20



(1)


Notice in writing of the time and place appointed under section 19 shall be served
by the landlord on the tenant or left at the tenant's residence or place of business at
least 5 days before the day appointed, if not more than 32 km from the tenant's residence
or place of business and one day in addition for every 32 km above the first 32, reckoning
any broken number above the first 32 as 32 km.






(2)

attached to it shall be annexed to the notice.








Court to issue writ of possession





21



(1)


If at the time and place appointed under section 19 the tenant, having been
notified as provided, fails to appear, the court, if it appears to it that the tenant
wrongfully holds, may order a writ to issue to the sheriff, commanding the sheriff to place
the landlord in possession of the premises in question.






(2)


If the tenant appears at the time and place, the court shall, in a summary manner,
hear the parties, examine the matter, administer an oath or affirmation to the witnesses
adduced by either party, and examine them.






(3)


If after the hearing and examination it appears to the court that the case is
clearly one coming under the true intent and meaning of section 18, and that the tenant
wrongfully holds against the right of the landlord, then it shall order the issue of the
writ under subsection (1) which may be in the words or to the effect of the form in the
Schedule; otherwise it shall dismiss the case, and the proceedings shall
form part of the records of the Supreme Court.

25



(1)


In case a tenant






(a)


fails to pay rent within 7 days of the time agreed on, or






(b)


makes default in observing any covenant, term or condition of the tenancy, the
default being of a character as to entitle the landlord to enter again or to determine
the tenancy,


and wrongfully refuses or neglects, on demand made in writing, to pay the rent or
to deliver the premises leased, which demand shall be served on the tenant or on some
adult person on the land or, if vacant, be affixed to the dwelling or other building on
the land, or on some portion of the fences, the landlord or the landlord's agent may apply
to the registrar of the Supreme Court on affidavit






(c)


setting forth the terms of the lease or occupancy,






(d)


the amount of rent in arrears, and the time for which it is in
arrears,






(e)


producing the demand made for the payment of rent or delivery of the possession,
and stating the refusal of the tenant to pay the rent or to deliver up possession, and
the answer of the tenant, if an answer was made, and






(f)


setting forth that the tenant has no right to set off or the reason for
withholding possession, or setting forth the covenant, term or condition in performance
of which default has been made, and the particulars of the forfeiture,


and on filing of the affidavit, the registrar shall issue a summons calling on the
tenant, 3 days after service, to show cause why an order should not be made for delivering
up possession of the premises to the landlord, and the summons shall be served in the same
manner as the demand.






(2)


An application under subsection (1) shall be commenced at a registry of the
Supreme Court located in the judicial district where the land is situated.








Procedure on hearing and on enforcement of order for
possession





26



(1)


Subject to subsection (3), on return of the summons, the court shall, if the tenant
appears, hear the parties on the evidence they may adduce on oath, and if the tenant,
having been served as provided, does not appear, proceed in the tenant's absence and make
an order, either to confirm the tenant in possession or to deliver possession to the
landlord, as the facts of the case warrant.






(2)


In case an order is made for the tenant to deliver possession, and the tenant
refuses, then the sheriff shall, with assistance as required, proceed under the order to
eject and remove the tenant, and the tenant's goods.






(3)


If a tenant, in case the default is for nonpayment of rent, before enforcement of
the order, pays the arrears and all costs, the proceedings shall be stayed and the tenant
may continue in possession of the former tenancy.






(4)


If the premises are vacant, or the tenant is not in possession, or if in
possession and the tenant refuses, on demand made in the presence of a witness, to admit
the sheriff, the latter, after a reasonable time has been allowed to the tenant or person
in possession to comply with the demand for admittance, may force open any door in order
to gain entrance, eject the tenant or occupant and give proper possession to the landlord
or the landlord's agent.








Costs





27



The court may award costs which may be added to the costs of the levy for
rent.








Form of summons and order





28

Application of

Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act

(Canada) and
rights of trustee and landlord





29



(1)


In construing any word or expression occurring in this section, reference may be
had to the interpretation section of the


Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act


(Canada).






(2)


Where a receiving order or an assignment is made against or by a lessee under the


Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act


(Canada),          the custodian or trustee, notwithstanding a condition, covenant or agreement in a lease,
has the right to hold and retain the leased premises for a period not exceeding 3 months
from the date of the receiving order or assignment, or until the expiration of the
tenancy, whichever happens first, on the same terms and conditions as the lessee might
have held the premises had no receiving order or assignment been made.






(3)


If the lessee is a tenant of premises the tenancy of which is not determined by
the making of a receiving order or assignment, the custodian or trustee may surrender
possession at any time, and the tenancy shall terminate, but nothing shall prevent the
trustee from transferring or disposing of a lease or leasehold property, or an interest of
the lessee, for the unexpired term to as full an extent as could have been done by the
lessee had the receiving order or assignment not been made. If the lease contains a
covenant, condition or agreement that the lessee or the lessee's assignees should not assign
or sublet the premises without the leave or consent of the landlord or other person, the
covenant, condition or agreement shall be of no effect in case of such a transfer or
disposition of the lease or leasehold property if the Supreme Court, on the application of
the trustee and after notice of the application to the landlord, approves the transfer or
disposition proposed to be made of the lease or leasehold property. Before the person to
whom the lease or leasehold property is transferred or disposed of is permitted to go into
occupation, that person shall deposit with the landlord a sum equal to 3 months' rent, or
supply to the landlord a guarantee bond approved by the court in a sum equal to 3 months'
rent, as security to the landlord that the person will observe and perform the terms of
the lease, but the amount deposited or secured to the landlord shall not exceed the rent
for the term assigned or sublet.






(4)


The custodian or trustee has the further right, at any time before surrendering
possession, to disclaim any lease, and the custodian's or trustee's entry into possession of the leased
premises and their occupation by the custodian or trustee while required for the purposes of the trust
estate shall not be evidence of an intention on the custodian's or trustee's part to elect to retain the
premises, nor affect the custodian's or trustee's right to disclaim or to surrender possession under this
section. If after occupation of the leased premises the custodian or trustee elects to
retain them and after assigns the lease to a person approved by the court as by subsection (3)
provided, the liability of the trustee and of the estate of the debtor is, subject to the
provisions of subsection (5), limited to the payment of rent for the period of time during
which the custodian or trustee remains in possession of the leased premises for the
purposes of the trust estate.






(5)


The landlord has a preferred claim against the estate of the lessee for arrears of
rent not exceeding 3 months' rent accrued due prior to the date of the receiving order or
assignment, together with all costs of distress properly made before the date in respect
of the rent hereby made a preferred claim.






(6)


The landlord may prove as a general creditor for






(a)


all surplus rent accrued due at the date of the receiving order or assignment;
and






(b)


any accelerated rent to which the landlord may be entitled under the landlord's lease,
not exceeding an amount equal to 3 months' rent.






(7)


Except as aforesaid, the landlord is not entitled to prove as a creditor for rent
for any portion of the unexpired term of the lease, but the trustee shall pay to the
landlord for the period during which the trustee or the custodian actually occupies the
premises from and after the date of the receiving order or assignment a rental calculated
on the basis of the lease and payable in accordance with its terms, except that any
payment already made to the landlord as rent in advance in respect of that period, and any
payment to be made to the landlord in respect of accelerated rent, shall be credited
against the amount payable by the trustee for that period.






(8)


The landlord is not entitled to distrain the goods of the lessee after the date of
the receiving order or assignment, and all goods distrained before that date shall on
demand be delivered by the person holding them to the custodian or trustee.






(9)


Nothing in this section shall render the trustee personally liable beyond the
assets of the debtor in the trustee's hands.








Frustration





30



The


Frustrated Contract Act


and the doctrine of frustration of        contract apply to leases.
