If, on the holding of a plebiscite under subsection (3) among holders of fluid milk dairy farm certificates who have their dairy farms within the area for which the plebiscite is held, those voting against the continuation of the collection of fees under this section constitute not less than 51% of those eligible to vote and who cast ballots, the Lieutenant Governor in Council may revoke the application of any orders and regulations made under subsection (1) to persons in that area.








Incorporation of codes or standards
