Payment not affected by appeal




41

(1)


Neither an appeal to the minister or to a court by any person nor any

the name of the person required to pay it, and




(b)

file the certificate with the Supreme Court.




(2)

and proceedings may be taken, as if it were a judgment of the Supreme
Court for the recovery of a debt in the amount stated against the
person named.






Attachment




46

(1)


If the commissioner has knowledge or suspects that a person is or is
about to become indebted or liable to make a payment to a claimant,
the commissioner may demand that the person pay to the government on
account of the claimant's liability under this Act all or part of the
money otherwise payable to the claimant.




(2)

Without limiting subsection (1), if the commissioner has knowledge or
suspects that a person is about to advance money to, make a payment on
behalf of or make a payment in respect of a negotiable instrument
issued by a claimant, the commissioner may demand that that person pay
to the minister on account of the claimant's liability under this Act
that money that would otherwise be advanced or paid.




(3)

If, under this section, the commissioner demands that a person pay to
the government, on account of the liability under this Act of a
claimant, money otherwise payable by that person to the claimant as
interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic
payment, the demand




(a)

applies to all of those payments to be made by the person to the
claimant until the liability under this Act is satisfied, and




(b)

operates to require payments to the commissioner out of each payment
of the amount stipulated by the commissioner in the demand.




(4)

Money or a beneficial interest in money in a savings institution




(a)

on deposit to the credit of a claimant at the time a demand is served,
or




(b)

deposited to the credit of a claimant after a demand is served


is money for which the savings institution is indebted to the
claimant, but money on deposit or deposited to the credit of a
claimant as described in paragraph (a) or (b) does not include money
on deposit or deposited to the credit of a claimant in the claimant's
capacity as a trustee.




(5)

A demand under this section continues in effect until the earlier of




(a)

the demand being satisfied, and




(b)

the expiration of 90 days after the demand is served.




(6)

Despite subsection (5), a demand made in respect of a periodic payment
referred to in subsection (3) continues in effect until satisfied
unless no periodic payment is made or is liable to be made within 90
days after the demand is served, in which case the demand ceases to
have effect on the expiration of that period.




(7)

Money demanded from a person by the commissioner under this section
becomes payable




(a)

as soon as the person is served with the demand, if the person is
indebted or liable to make a payment to the claimant at the time the
demand is served, or




(b)

in any other case, as soon as the person becomes indebted or liable to
make a payment to the claimant.




(8)

A person who fails to comply with a demand under subsection (1) or (3)
is liable to pay to the government an amount equal to the amount that
the person was required to pay under subsection (1) or (3).




(9)

A person who fails to comply with a demand under subsection (2) is
liable to pay to the government an amount equal to the lesser of




(a)

the aggregate of the money advanced or paid, and




(b)

the amount that the person was required to pay under subsection (2).




(10)

The receipt of the minister for money paid under this section is a
good and sufficient discharge of the original liability to the extent
of the payment.




(11)

Money paid by any person to the government in compliance with a demand
under this section is deemed to have been paid by that person to the
claimant in respect of whom the demand was made.






Recovery by distress




47

(1)


The commissioner or the commissioner's agent may levy the amount of
the recoverable amount payable by a person, with costs, by distress of




(a)

the goods and chattels of the person liable to pay the recoverable
amount,




(b)

any goods and chattels in that person's possession, wherever they may
be found in British Columbia, or




(c)

any goods and chattels found on that person's premises that are the
property of or in the possession of any other occupant of the premises
and that would be subject to distress for arrears of rent due to a
landlord.




(2)

The costs of the commissioner or the commissioner's agent for a
distress under this section are chargeable against the person referred
to in subsection (1) and are those payable as between landlord and
tenant.




(3)

If distress is made, the commissioner or the commissioner's agent, by
advertisement posted in at least 3 conspicuous public places in the
locality where the sale of the distrained property is to be made, must
give at least 10 days' public notice of the time and place of the sale
and of the name of the person in default.




(4)

At the time given in the notice, the commissioner or the
commissioner's agent must sell at public auction the distrained
property, or as much of it as may be necessary.




(5)

If the distrained property is sold for more than the amount of the
recoverable amount and costs, and if no claim to the surplus is made
by any other person on the ground that the property sold belonged to
the person, or that the person was entitled by lien or other right to
the surplus, the surplus must be paid over to the person who had
possession of the property when the distress was made, and a receipt
must be taken.




(6)

If a claim is made by the person for whose recoverable amount the
property was distrained, and the claim is admitted, the surplus must
be paid to the person, and a receipt must be taken.




(7)

If the claim is contested, the surplus must be retained by the
commissioner until the rights of the parties have been determined in
court or otherwise.






Liability of directors




48

(1)


If a corporation has failed to pay a recoverable amount, the directors
of the corporation at the time the corporation was liable to pay the
amount are jointly and severally liable, together with the
corporation, to pay that amount to the government.




(2)

A director is not liable under subsection (1) unless




(a)

a certificate for the amount of the corporation's liability referred
to in that subsection has been filed under section 45
[filing of certificate]
with the Supreme Court and execution for that amount has been returned
unsatisfied in whole or in part, or




(b)

the corporation has commenced liquidation or dissolution proceedings
or has been dissolved and a claim for the amount of the corporation's
liability referred to in that subsection has been proved within 6
months after the earlier of the date of commencement of the
proceedings and the date of dissolution.




(3)

A director is not liable for a failure under subsection (1) if the
director exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent
the failure that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in
comparable circumstances.




(4)

If execution referred to in subsection (2) (a) has issued, the amount
recoverable from a director is the amount remaining unsatisfied after
execution.




(5)

If a director pays an amount in respect of a corporation's liability
referred to in subsection (1) that is proved in liquidation or
dissolution proceedings,




(a)

the director is entitled to any preference that the government would
have been entitled to had that amount not been paid, and




(b)

if a certificate that relates to that amount has been filed, the
director is entitled to an assignment of the certificate to the extent
of the director's payment.




(6)

A director who has satisfied a claim under this section is entitled to
contribution from the other directors who were liable for the claim.

(4)

If a notice of determination reflecting the application of subsection
(2) to a transaction has been served on a person, any other person is
