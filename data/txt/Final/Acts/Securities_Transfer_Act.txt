to, or a security interest in, the financial asset.

took the action described in subsection (1) or (2) after having been
served with an injunction, restraining order or other legal process

from doing so and after having had a reasonable opportunity to obey or
otherwise abide by the injunction, restraining order or other legal
process;

establishes a security entitlement to the financial asset in favour of
an entitlement holder is a purchaser for value of the financial asset.




(2)

acquiring the security entitlement establishes a security entitlement
to the financial asset in favour of an entitlement holder.




Part 3 — Issue and Issuer





Terms of security




56

(1)


Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a
certificated security include




(a)

the terms stated on the security certificate, and




(b)

any terms made part of the security by reference on the security
certificate to another instrument, indenture or other document or to a
statute, regulation, rule, order or the like, to the extent that those
terms do not conflict with the terms stated on the security
certificate.




(2)

A reference described in subsection (1) (b) does not by itself
constitute notice to a purchaser for value of a defect that goes to
the validity of the security, even if the security certificate
expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice.




(3)

The terms of an uncertificated security include those stated in any
instrument, indenture or other document or in a statute, regulation,
rule, order or the like under which the security is issued.






Enforcement of security




57

(1)


An unauthorized signature placed on a security certificate before or
in the course of issue is ineffective except that the signature is
effective in favour of a purchaser for value of the certificated
security if the purchaser is without notice of the lack of authority
and the signing has been done by




(a)

an authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent or other person
entrusted by the issuer with the signing of the security certificate
or of any similar security certificate or with the immediate
preparation for signing of any of those security certificates, or




(b)

an employee of the issuer, or of any persons referred to in paragraph

agency of it unless




(a)

there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements
governing the issue, or




(b)

the issuer has received all or a substantial part of the consideration
for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and the
purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow
money or issue the security.






Lack of genuineness of certificated security




58


Except as otherwise provided in section 57 (1), lack of genuineness of
a certificated security is a complete defence, even against a
purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of genuineness.






Other defences




59


All other defences of the issuer of a security that are not referred
to in sections 56 to 58, including non-delivery and conditional
delivery of a security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value
who has taken the security without notice of the particular defence.






Right to cancel contract




60


Nothing in sections 56 to 59 affects the right of a party to a "when,
as and if issued" contract or a "when distributed" contract to cancel
the contract in the event of a material change in the character of the
security that is the subject of the contract or in the plan or
arrangement under which the security is to be issued or distributed.






Staleness as notice of defect or defence




61

(1)


After an act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of
the principal obligation represented by a certificated security or
that sets a date on or after which the security is to be presented or
surrendered for redemption or exchange, a purchaser is deemed to have
notice of any defect in the security's issue or of any defence of the
issuer,




(a)

if




(i)

the act or event requires that, on presentation or surrender of the
security certificate, money be paid, a certificated security be
delivered or a transfer of an uncertificated security be registered,




(ii)

the money or security is available on the date set for payment or
exchange, and




(iii)

the purchaser takes delivery of the security more than one year after
the date referred to in subparagraph (ii), or




(b)

if




(i)

the act or event is not one to which paragraph (a) applies, and




(ii)

the purchaser takes delivery of the security more than 2 years after
the date on which performance became due or the date set for
presentation or surrender.




(2)

Subsection (1) does not apply to a call that has been revoked.






Effect of issuer's restriction on transfer




62


A restriction on the transfer of a security imposed by the issuer,
even if otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without
knowledge of the restriction unless




(a)

the security is a certificated security and the restriction is noted
conspicuously on the security certificate, or




(b)

the security is an uncertificated security and the registered owner
has been given a notice of the restriction by a person required to
give such notice in order to make the restriction effective.






Completion of security certificate




63

(1)


If a security certificate contains the signatures necessary to the
security's issue or transfer but is incomplete in any other respect,




(a)

any person may complete the security certificate by filling in the
blanks in accordance with the person's authority, and




(b)

even if any of the blanks are incorrectly filled in, the security
certificate as completed is enforceable by a purchaser who took the
security certificate for value and without notice of the
incorrectness.




(2)

A complete security certificate that has been improperly altered, even
if fraudulently, remains enforceable, but only according to its
original terms.






Rights and duties of issuer respecting registered owners




64

(1)


Before due presentation for registration of transfer of a certificated
security in registered form or the receipt of an instruction
requesting registration of transfer of an uncertificated security, an
issuer or indenture trustee may treat the registered owner as the
person exclusively entitled




(a)

to vote,




(b)

to receive notices,




(c)

to receive any interest, dividend or other payments, and




(d)

to otherwise exercise all the rights and powers of an owner.




(2)

Nothing in this Act affects the liability of the registered owner of a
security for a call, assessment or the like.






Warranties by person signing security certificate




65

(1)


A person signing a security certificate as authenticating trustee,
registrar, transfer agent or the like warrants to a purchaser for
value of the certificated security, if the purchaser is without notice
of a particular defect in respect of that security, that




(a)

the security certificate is genuine,




(b)

the person's own participation in the issue of the security is within
the person's capacity and within the scope of the authority received
by the person from the issuer, and




(c)

the person has reasonable grounds to believe that the certificated
security is in the form and within the amount the issuer is authorized
to issue.




(2)

Unless otherwise agreed, a person signing a security certificate under
subsection (1) does not assume responsibility for the validity of the
security in any respect other than that set out in subsection (1).






Issuer's lien




66


A lien in favour of an issuer on a certificated security is valid
against a purchaser only if the right of the issuer to the lien is
noted conspicuously on the security certificate.






Overissue




67

(1)


Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3), the
provisions of this Act that make a security enforceable against an
issuer despite a defence or defect or that compel a security's issue
or reissue do not apply to the extent that the application of such
provision would result in an overissue.




(2)

If an identical security not constituting an overissue is reasonably
available for purchase, a person entitled to issue of a security, or a
person entitled to enforce a security against an issuer despite a
defence or defect as provided under section 57, 58 or 59 or under a
similar law of another jurisdiction, may compel the issuer to purchase
the security and deliver it, if certificated, or register its
transfer, if uncertificated, against surrender of any security
certificate the person holds.




(3)

If an identical security not constituting an overissue is not
reasonably available for purchase, a person entitled to issue of a
security, or a person entitled to enforce a security against an issuer
despite a defence or defect as provided under section 57, 58 or 59 or
under a similar law of another jurisdiction, may recover from the
issuer the price that the last purchaser for value paid for the
security with interest from the date of the person's demand.




(4)

An overissue is deemed not to have occurred if appropriate action has
cured the overissue.




Part 4 — Transfer of Certificated and Uncertificated Securities

another person, other than a securities intermediary, either




(i)

acquires possession of the security certificate on behalf of the
purchaser, or




(ii)

having previously acquired possession of the security certificate,
acknowledges that the person holds the security certificate for the
purchaser, or

a securities intermediary acting on behalf of the purchaser acquires
possession of the security certificate, the security certificate is in
registered form and the security certificate is

payable to the order of the purchaser, or




(iii)

specially endorsed to the purchaser by an effective endorsement and
has not been endorsed to the securities intermediary or in blank.

the issuer registers the purchaser as the registered owner, on the
original issue or the registration of transfer, or




(b)

another person, other than a securities intermediary, either




(i)

becomes the registered owner of the uncertificated security on behalf
of the purchaser, or

having previously become the registered owner, acknowledges that the
person holds the uncertificated security for the purchaser.






Rights of purchaser

to the extent of the interest purchased.




(3)

A purchaser of a certificated security who as a previous holder had
notice of an adverse claim does not improve that purchaser's position
by virtue of taking from a protected purchaser.






Protected purchaser

purchaser, also acquires the purchaser's interest in the security free
of any adverse claim.

specify to whom the security is to be transferred or who has power to
transfer the security.

A holder may convert an endorsement in blank to a special endorsement.






Endorsement of part of security certificate




72


An endorsement of a security certificate, if the endorsement purports
to be in respect of only some of the units represented by the
certificate, is effective to the extent of the endorsement if the
units are intended by the issuer to be separately transferable.






When endorsement constitutes transfer of security




73


An endorsement of a security certificate, whether special or in blank,
does not constitute a transfer of the security




(a)

until the delivery of the security certificate on which the
endorsement appears, or




(b)

if the endorsement is on a separate document, until the delivery of
both




(i)

the security certificate, and




(ii)

the document on which the endorsement appears.






Endorsement missing




74


If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a
purchaser without a necessary endorsement, the purchaser may become a
protected purchaser only when the endorsement is supplied, but against
the transferor, the transfer is complete on delivery and the purchaser
has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary endorsement
supplied.






Notice of adverse claim on endorsement




75


A purported endorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may
constitute notice of an adverse claim to the security certificate, but
the purported endorsement does not otherwise affect any right that the
holder has.






Obligations of endorser




76


Unless otherwise agreed, a person making an endorsement makes only the
warranties set out in sections 33 and 35 and does not warrant that the
security will be honoured by the issuer.

completed incorrectly.

If, under subsection (1), an issuer is under a duty to register a
transfer of a security, the issuer is liable to a person presenting a
certificated security or an instruction for registration, or to that
person's principal, for any loss resulting from unreasonable delay in
registration or the failure or refusal to register the transfer.






Assurances respecting endorsement or instruction




87

(1)


An issuer may require the following assurance that each necessary
endorsement or each instruction is genuine and authorized:




(a)

in all cases, a guarantee of the signature of the person making the
endorsement or originating the instruction, including, in the case of
an instruction, reasonable assurance of identity;




(b)

if the endorsement is made or the instruction is originated by an
agent, appropriate assurance of actual authority to act;

have done so;




(e)

if the endorsement is made or the instruction is originated by a

subsection, assurance appropriate to the case corresponding as nearly
as may be to the assurance required by paragraph (b), (c) or (d).




(2)

An issuer may elect to require reasonable assurance beyond that
specified in this section.




(3)

In this section:



"appropriate evidence of appointment or incumbency"

in any other case,




(i)

a copy of a document showing the appointment,

long as those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.






Demand that issuer not register transfer




88

(1)


A person who is the appropriate person to make an endorsement or to
originate an instruction may demand that the issuer not register a
transfer of a security by communicating a notice to the issuer setting
out

(b)

the issue of which the security is a part, and




(c)

an address of the person making the demand to which communications may
be sent.

A demand made under subsection (1) becomes effective when the issuer
has had a reasonable opportunity to act on the demand, having regard
to the time and manner of receipt of the demand by the issuer.






Duty of issuer respecting demand to not register transfer




89

(1)


If, after a demand made under section 88 becomes effective, a
certificated security in registered form is presented to an issuer

to an issuer with a request to register a transfer of an
uncertificated security, the issuer must promptly give a notice as
described in subsection (2) to the following persons:




(a)

the person who initiated the demand, at the address provided in the
demand;

the person who presented the security for the registration of transfer
or originated the instruction requesting the registration of transfer.

uncertificated security has been received,




(b)

that a demand that the issuer not register a transfer had previously
been received, and




(c)

that the issuer will withhold registration of transfer for a period of
time stated in the notice in order to provide the person who initiated
the demand an opportunity to obtain legal process or to provide an
indemnity bond referred to in section 90.




(3)

The period of time that may be provided for under subsection (2) (c)
must not exceed 30 days from the date the notice was given and the
issuer may specify a shorter period of time in the notice so long as
the shorter period of time being specified is not manifestly
unreasonable.






Liability of issuer respecting demand to not register transfer




90

(1)


An issuer is not liable, to a person who initiated a demand under
section 88 that the issuer not register a transfer, for any loss that
the person suffers as a result of the registration of a transfer in
accordance with an effective endorsement or instruction if the person
who initiated the demand does not, within the time stated in the

(a)

obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction or other process
from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from
registering the transfer, or

provide the issuer with an indemnity bond sufficient in the issuer's
judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar or
other agent of the issuer involved from any loss that those persons
may suffer by refusing to register the transfer.

Nothing in subsection (1) or in section 88 or 89 relieves an issuer
from liability for registering a transfer under an endorsement or
instruction that was not effective.






Wrongful registration of transfer




91

(1)


Except as otherwise provided in section 93, an issuer is liable for
wrongful registration of transfer if




(a)

the issuer has registered a transfer of a security to a person not
entitled to the security, and




(b)

the transfer was registered by the issuer




(i)

under an ineffective endorsement or instruction,




(ii)

after a demand that the issuer not register a transfer became
effective under section 88 and the issuer did not comply with section
89,




(iii)

after the issuer had been served with an injunction, restraining order
or other legal process referred to in section 90 enjoining the issuer
from registering the transfer and the issuer had a reasonable
opportunity to obey or otherwise abide by the injunction, restraining
order or other legal process, or




(iv)

acting in collusion with the wrongdoer.




(2)

An issuer who is liable for the wrongful registration of transfer
under subsection (1) must, on demand, provide the person entitled to
the security with




(a)

a like certificated or uncertificated security, as the case may be,
and




(b)

any payments or distributions that the person did not receive as a
result of the wrongful registration.




(3)

If the provision of a security under subsection (2) would result in an
overissue, the issuer's liability to provide the person with a like
security is governed by section 67.




(4)

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1) or in any applicable
law of Canada or of any province or territory of Canada relating to
the collection of taxes, an issuer is not liable to an owner or other
person suffering loss as a result of the registration of transfer of a
security if the registration was made under an effective endorsement
or instruction.






Replacement of lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken security
certificate




92

(1)


If an owner of a certificated security, whether in registered form or
bearer form, claims that the security certificate has been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken, the issuer must issue a new security
certificate if the owner




(a)

so requests before the issuer has notice that the lost, destroyed or
wrongfully taken security certificate has been acquired by a protected
purchaser,




(b)

provides the issuer with an indemnity bond sufficient in the issuer's
judgment to protect the issuer from any loss that the issuer may
suffer by issuing a new certificate, and




(c)

satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the issuer.




(2)

If, after the issue of a new security certificate, a protected
purchaser of the original security certificate presents the original
security certificate for the registration of transfer, the issuer




(a)

must register the transfer unless the registration would result in an
overissue, in which case the issuer's liability is governed by section
67,




(b)

may exercise the rights the issuer may have under the indemnity bond
referred to in subsection (1) (b), and




(c)

may recover the new security certificate from a person to whom it was
issued or from any person, other than a protected purchaser, taking
under that person.






Obligation to notify issuer of lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken
security certificate




93


An owner of a security may not assert against the issuer a claim for
wrongful registration of transfer under section 91 or a claim to a new
security certificate under section 92 if




(a)

a security certificate has been lost, apparently destroyed or
wrongfully taken and the owner fails to give a notice to the issuer of
that fact within a reasonable time after the owner has notice of it,
and




(b)

the issuer registers a transfer of the security before receiving a
notice of the loss, apparent destruction or wrongful taking of the
security certificate.






Obligation of authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent or
other agent




94


A person acting as authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent
or other agent for an issuer in the registration of a transfer of the
issuer's securities, in the issue of new security certificates or
uncertificated securities or in the cancellation of surrendered
security certificates has the same obligation to the holder or owner
of a certificated or uncertificated security with regard to the
particular function performed as the issuer has in regard to that
function.




Part 6 — Security Entitlements





Acquisition of security entitlement




95

asset for the person and, in either case, accepts it for credit to the
person's securities account, or




(c)

becomes obligated under another statute, law, regulation or rule to

(2)

If a condition of subsection (1) has been met, a person has a security
entitlement even if the securities intermediary does not itself hold
the financial asset.




(3)

A person is to be treated as holding a financial asset directly rather
than as having a security entitlement with respect to the financial
asset if a securities intermediary holds the financial asset for that
person and the financial asset




(a)

is registered in the name of, payable to the order of or specially
endorsed to that person, and




(b)

has not been endorsed to the securities intermediary or in blank.

entitlement, or




(b)

the time that the securities intermediary acquired the interest in
that financial asset.

financial asset under subsection (1) may be enforced against a
purchaser of the financial asset, or interest in it, only if

purchaser, and

acting on behalf of all entitlement holders having security
entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset may recover
the financial asset, or interest in it, from the purchaser.

provided under subsection (5), an entitlement holder whose security
entitlement remains unsatisfied has the right to recover the
entitlement holder's interest in the financial asset from the
purchaser.

gives value,




(b)

obtains control or possession, and

does not act in collusion with the securities intermediary in
violating the securities intermediary's obligations under section 98.

the rights of the securities intermediary arising out of a security
interest, whether that security interest arises under a security
agreement with the entitlement holder or otherwise, and

Rights of purchaser respecting adverse claim




104

(1)


In a case not covered by the priority rules under the

Personal Property Security Act

or the rules set out in subsection (3), a legal proceeding based on an
adverse claim to a financial asset or a security entitlement, however
framed, may not be brought against a person who purchases a security

Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3), if a
securities intermediary does not have sufficient interests in a
particular financial asset to satisfy both the securities
intermediary's obligations to entitlement holders who have security
entitlements to that financial asset and the securities intermediary's
obligation to a creditor of the securities intermediary who has a
security interest in that financial asset, the claims of entitlement
holders, other than the creditor, have priority over the claim of the
creditor.




(2)

A claim of a creditor of a securities intermediary who has a security
interest in a financial asset held by a securities intermediary has
priority over claims of the securities intermediary's entitlement
holders who have security entitlements with respect to that financial
asset if the creditor has control over the financial asset.




(3)

If a clearing agency does not have sufficient financial assets to
satisfy both the clearing agency's obligations to entitlement holders
who have security entitlements with respect to a financial asset and

creditor has priority over the claims of entitlement holders.
