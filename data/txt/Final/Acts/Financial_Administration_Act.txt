to apply it to its purpose, and to furnish to the Minister of Finance vouchers that the person has done so.

(a)


by the books or accounts kept by the person or in the person's office,






(b)


in an accounting by the person, or






(c)


by the person's written acknowledgement or confession,


that the person has received money belonging to the government and has refused or neglected to pay the money to the proper persons at the proper times, an affidavit deposing to the facts and sworn by a person having knowledge of them is, in a proceeding for the recovery of the money, proof of the facts stated in it.

(a)


fails to pay the money to the Minister of Finance as required under subsection (2), or

in excess of the authority conferred by an enactment,






(b)


without the authority of an enactment, or






(c)


contrary to an enactment,


and a right is asserted by the government to recover the payment or part of it, or to retain other money in full or partial satisfaction of a claim arising out of the payment, the person against whom the right is asserted may, subject to subsection (2), rely on any matter of fact or law, including estoppel, that would constitute a defence in a proceeding brought to recover the payment as if it had been made under a mistake.






(2)


Subsection (1) does not enable a person to rely on a defence that a payment made by the government was made under a mistake of law, and the right of the government to recover the money paid by it is not impaired merely because the payment was made under a mistake of law.
