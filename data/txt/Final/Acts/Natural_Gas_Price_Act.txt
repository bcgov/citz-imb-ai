Part 1 — Acquisition and Sale of Natural Gas by Government







Acquisition of natural gas by government





2



(1)


The minister may direct, by acquisition order, the producer of the natural gas specified in the order to deliver the natural gas to the minister at a point in British Columbia.






(2)


Natural gas that is directed to be delivered to the minister under an acquisition order becomes the property of the government when the gas is delivered to the point specified in the order.






(3)


An acquisition order may be made in respect of natural gas produced after the date the order is issued, even though the natural gas is sold under a contract that was made before the date the order is issued.






(4)


An acquisition order does not preclude a producer from removing from the natural gas before delivering it to the minister






(a)


any component of the natural gas other than methane, and






(b)


methane, to the extent that its removal is necessary in order to remove any other component of the natural gas.








Price of acquired natural gas





3



(1)


In an acquisition order, the minister must establish a price for each volume of natural gas acquired under the acquisition order.






(2)


Subject to subsections (3) and (6), the price established under subsection (1) must equal the resale price of the volume of natural gas minus the costs incurred for gathering, processing and transmitting the natural gas after it is delivered to the point specified in the acquisition order, except to the extent that the resale price is net of those costs.






(3)


If the minister considers that the resale price of the volume of natural gas is less than its fair market value, the price established under subsection (1) must equal the price the minister considers is fair market value minus the costs referred to in subsection (2).






(4)


If a volume of natural gas becomes the property of the government under an acquisition order, the government owes the producer from whom the natural gas was acquired an amount equal to the price established in the acquisition order for that volume of natural gas.






(5)


If an error is made in an acquisition order or the resale price of a volume of natural gas acquired under an acquisition order is changed, the minister may amend any term of the acquisition order, including the price established for a volume of natural gas.






(6)


If the resale price of a volume of natural gas is net of any cost charged by an aggregator in respect of that gas and the minister determines that that cost is excessive, the minister may amend the price established in an acquisition order issued for that volume of natural gas by adding the excess amount to the amount determined under subsection (2).






(7)


If the price established for a volume of natural gas in an acquisition order is amended under subsection (5) or (6),






(a)


the amendment may be made retroactive to the extent necessary to give it effect on delivery of that volume of natural gas to the point specified in the acquisition order, and






(b)


the amended price is deemed for the purposes of subsection (4) and section 4 to be the price established in the acquisition order.








Sale of natural gas by government





4



(1)


After a volume of natural gas is acquired from a producer under an acquisition order, the minister must, on behalf of the government, sell the volume of natural gas back to the producer in accordance with the terms of the acquisition order.






(2)


A producer to whom a volume of natural gas is sold back under subsection (1) must buy back the natural gas at the price established in the acquisition order and the government may set off from that price the amount owing to the producer under section 3 (4) for that volume of gas.








Duty to provide information





5



(1)


In this section,

"minister"

includes a person designated by the minister.






(2)


Before natural gas is produced under a resale contract, the producer of the natural gas must,

(b)


if the contract is oral, provide the minister with the details, including






(i)


the date delivery of natural gas will start,






(ii)


the name and address of the buyer, and






(iii)


the price of the natural gas under the contract.






(3)


After a resale contract is amended or an interest in a resale contract is assigned, the producer of the natural gas must immediately notify the minister and provide the terms of the amendment or assignment.






(4)


Within 30 days after a contract is made for the sale of any component of natural gas other than methane, the producer of the natural gas must,






(a)


if the contract is in writing, provide the minister with a copy of it,






(b)


if the contract is oral, provide the minister with the details, including






(i)


delivery dates,

(a)


a resale contract;






(b)


a contract by which an aggregator sells or agrees to sell netback gas as defined in section 8;

Failure to provide information





6



(1)


A person who does not comply with section 5 or with a request made under that section, or who knowingly provides false information under section 5 or to a request made under that section, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of not more than $100 000.






(2)


If a producer does not comply with section 5 or with a request made under that section, or knowingly provides false information under section 5 or to the request made under that section, the minister may, after giving 60 days' notice to the producer, cancel a permit, licence or lease granted to the producer under the


Petroleum and Natural Gas Act


, whether or not the producer is convicted of an offence under subsection (1).






(3)


If an aggregator does not comply with a request made under section 5 or knowingly provides false information in response to that request, the minister may revoke or may refuse, despite section 9, to issue a finding of producer support in respect of natural gas sold by the aggregator.

If after a hearing under section 9 (6) (b) the minister determines that there has been a breach of the condition referred to in section 9 (6) (a), the minister may direct the aggregator of the netback gas to conduct a vote of the producers of the natural gas on the question of whether the producers accept the price determined by the arbitration award or the formula or method provided for in the arbitration award for the calculation of the price, as the case may be.






(2)


If the result of the vote conducted under subsection (1) is that the prescribed minimum degree of producer support is not obtained for that price or that formula or method, as the case may be, the minister may revoke the finding of producer support.






(3)


If the minister has reason to believe that a finding of producer support may have been obtained by misrepresentation of any fact material to the minister in issuing the finding, the minister may hold a hearing on the matter.






(4)


If the minister determines after a hearing under subsection (3) that the finding of producer support was obtained by misrepresentation of any fact material to the minister in issuing the finding, the minister may revoke the finding.






(5)


A revocation of a finding of producer support becomes effective on a date that is specified by order of the minister and is not earlier than






(a)


the first day of the month following the month in which the finding is revoked, in the case of a revocation under subsection (2), or
