During parenting time, a guardian may exercise, subject to an
agreement or order that provides otherwise, the parental
responsibility of making day-to-day decisions affecting the child and
having day-to-day care, control and supervision of the child.






Exercise of parental responsibilities




43

(1)


A child's guardian must exercise parental responsibilities in the best

the court is enforceable under this Act as if it were an order of the

(a)

a guardian from making an application under section 69

, or




(b)

a person having contact with the child from making an application
under section 59
[orders respecting contact]
or 60

[changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting contact]

, as applicable, for the purpose of maintaining the relationship
between the child and a person having contact with the child if
relocation occurs.






Child may be relocated unless guardian objects




68


If a child's guardian gives notice under section 66
[notice of relocation]
that the guardian plans to relocate the child, the relocation may
occur on or after the date set out in the notice unless another
guardian of the child, within 30 days after receiving the notice,
files an application for an order to prohibit the relocation.






Orders respecting relocation




69

(1)


In this section,
"relocating guardian"
means a guardian who plans to relocate a child.

prohibiting the relocation of a child by the relocating guardian.

, the court, in making an order under this section, must consider, in
addition to the factors set out in section 37 (2), the factors set out
in subsection (4) (a) of this section.




(4)

If an application is made under this section and the relocating
guardian and another guardian do not have substantially equal

the relocating guardian must satisfy the court that




(i)

the proposed relocation is made in good faith, and




(ii)

the relocating guardian has proposed reasonable and workable
arrangements to preserve the relationship between the child and the
child's other guardians, persons who are entitled to contact with the
child, and other persons who have a significant role in the child's
life, and

on the court being satisfied of the factors referred to in paragraph

guardian and another guardian have substantially equal parenting time
with the child, the relocating guardian must satisfy the court




(a)

of the factors described in subsection (4) (a), and

For the purposes of determining if the proposed relocation is made in
good faith, the court must consider all relevant factors, including
the following:

(b)

whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance the general
quality of life of the child and, if applicable, of the relocating
guardian, including increasing emotional well-being or financial or
educational opportunities;




(c)

whether notice was given under section 66
[notice of relocation]
;




(d)

any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or an
order.




(7)

In determining whether to make an order under this section, the court
must not consider whether a guardian would still relocate if the
child's relocation were not permitted.

(1)


If the court makes an order under section 69
[orders respecting relocation]
that permits a child's relocation, the court may make any of the
following orders:




(a)

subject to subsection (2) of this section, if the order made under
section 69 affects an agreement or order that allocates parenting
arrangements between the relocating guardian and another guardian, an
order under section 45
[orders respecting parenting arrangements]
or 47

[changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting parenting
arrangements]

transfer specific property to a trustee named by the court.




(2)

In making an order under subsection (1), the court must seek to
preserve, to a reasonable extent, parenting arrangements under the
original agreement or order.






Not a change in circumstances

The fact that an order is made that prohibits a child's relocation is
not, in itself, a change in the child's circumstances for the purposes
of section 47

[changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting parenting
arrangements]

.




Division 7 — Extraprovincial Matters Respecting Parenting Arrangements





Definitions and interpretation




72

(1)


In this Division:



"extraprovincial order"

means an order of an extraprovincial tribunal that is similar in
nature to an order respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or
contact with a child;



"extraprovincial tribunal"

means a court or tribunal, outside British Columbia, having authority
to make an extraprovincial order.




(2)

For the purposes of this Division, a child is habitually resident in
the place where the child most recently resided




(a)

with the child's parents,




(b)

if the parents are living separate and apart, with one parent




(i)

under an agreement,




(ii)

with the implied consent of the other parent, or




(iii)

under an order of a court or tribunal, or




(c)

with a person other than a parent on a permanent basis for a
significant period of time.




(3)

The removal or withholding of a child without the consent of a
guardian does not affect the child's habitual residence unless the
guardian from whom the child is being removed or withheld acquiesces
or delays in applying for an order of a court or an extraprovincial
tribunal.






Purposes




73


The purposes of this Division are as follows:




(a)

to ensure that court applications respecting guardianship, parenting
arrangements or contact with a child are determined on the basis of
the best interests of the child;




(b)

to avoid the making of orders respecting guardianship, parenting
arrangements or contact with a child, respecting the same child, in
more than one jurisdiction;




(c)

to discourage child abduction as an alternative to determining by due
process the guardianship of, or parenting arrangements with respect
to, a child;




(d)

to provide for effective enforcement of orders respecting
guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, and for
the recognition and enforcement of extraprovincial orders.






Determining whether to act under this Part




74

(1)


This section applies if an order respecting guardianship, parenting
arrangements or contact with a child may be made, respecting the same
child, in more than one jurisdiction.




(2)

Despite any other provision of this Part, a court may make an order
under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or
contact with a child only if one of the following conditions is met:




(a)

the child is habitually resident in British Columbia when the
application is filed;




(b)

the child is not habitually resident in British Columbia when the
application is filed, but the court is satisfied that




(i)

the child is physically present in British Columbia when the
application is filed,




(ii)

substantial evidence concerning the best interests of the child is
available in British Columbia,




(iii)

no application for an extraprovincial order is pending before an
extraprovincial tribunal in a place where the child is habitually
resident,




(iv)

no extraprovincial order has been recognized by a court in British
Columbia,




(v)

the child has a real and substantial connection with British Columbia,
and




(vi)

on the balance of convenience, it is appropriate for jurisdiction to
be exercised in British Columbia;




(c)

the child is physically present in British Columbia and the court is
satisfied that the child would suffer serious harm if the child were
to




(i)

remain with, or be returned to, the child's guardian, or




(ii)

be removed from British Columbia.




(3)

A court may decline to make an order under this Part if the court
considers that it is more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised
outside British Columbia.






Recognition of extraprovincial orders

following apply:

the extraprovincial tribunal would have had jurisdiction to make the
order under the rules that are applicable in British Columbia;




(b)

each party to a proceeding in which the extraprovincial order was made
had




(i)

reasonable notice that the order would be made, and




(ii)

a reasonable opportunity to be heard respecting the order;




(c)

the extraprovincial tribunal was required by law to consider the best
interests of the child;




(d)

it would not be contrary to public policy in British Columbia to
recognize the order.




(2)

On recognition by a court,




(a)

an extraprovincial order has the same effect, and may be enforced, as
if it were an order made under section 45
[orders respecting parenting arrangements]
, 51
[orders respecting guardianship]
or 59
[orders respecting contact]
, as applicable, and




(b)

the court may, if necessary to give effect to the extraprovincial
order, make any order that the court may make under this Act.




(3)

If an application is made to recognize more than one extraprovincial
order and the orders conflict, the court must recognize the order that
is most consistent with the best interests of the child.






Superseding extraprovincial orders




76

(1)


On application, a court may make an order that supersedes an
extraprovincial order that has been recognized under section 75
[recognition of extraprovincial orders]
if satisfied that




(a)

the child would suffer serious harm if that child were to




(i)

remain with, or be returned to, the child's guardian, or




(ii)

be removed from British Columbia, or




(b)

a change in circumstances affects, or is likely to affect, the best
interests of the child and subsection (2) of this section applies.

application is filed, but the court is satisfied that




(i)

the circumstances described in section 74 (2) (b) (i), (ii), (v) and

apply, and




(ii)

the child no longer has a real and substantial connection with the
place where the extraprovincial order was made.

(a)

may not make an order or declines to make an order under section 74
[determining whether to act under this Part]
, or

wrongfully retained in, British Columbia.

more of the following:

interests of the child;

stay an application to the court for an order, subject to




(i)

the condition that a party to the application promptly start a similar
proceeding before an extraprovincial tribunal, or




(ii)

any other conditions the court considers appropriate;




(c)

order a party to return the child to a place the court considers
appropriate and, in the discretion of the court, order a party to pay

the member's pension commences, and




(b)

the limited member receives the limited member's proportionate share
of the benefits,


the limited member is entitled to receive that proportionate share of
benefits to which the limited member would have been entitled had the
member not died, which proportionate share is to equal the commuted
value of the limited member's proportionate share as calculated as of
the valuation date determined in accordance with the regulations.




(3)

If a member dies after the limited member receives all of the limited
member's proportionate share of benefits under sections 115
[benefits determined under benefit formula provision]
and 119
[supplemental plans]
, the limited member is entitled to no further share of the member's
benefits except to the extent that the member has designated the
limited member as a beneficiary of the benefits.




(4)

If a limited member dies before the member, before the member's
pension commences and before receiving the limited member's
proportionate share of benefits under sections 115
[benefits determined under benefit formula provision]
and 119
[supplemental plans]
, the administrator must transfer to the credit of the limited
member's estate the proportionate share of the commuted value of the
benefits.




(5)

Despite the division of benefits under this Part,




(a)

if a member's pension is in the form of a joint and survivor pension
with a spouse, the spouse is the owner of the survivor benefits, and




(b)

a limited member who is a beneficiary of survivor benefits is entitled
to all of the survivor benefits, subject to the entitlement, if any,
of another limited member.






Entitlement to survivor benefits




125


If benefits are divided under this Part, entitlement to the member's
share of the survivor benefits is to be determined in accordance with
the law that governs the designation of beneficiaries, or the law that
governs if there is no beneficiary designation, as applicable.






Waiving pension or survivor benefits




126

(1)


Before an administrator implements the division of benefits under a
plan, a limited member or the personal representative of the limited
member's estate may waive the division of benefits by giving notice in
accordance with section 136
[notice or waiver]
.




(2)

If a member of a plan dies after pension commencement and the member's
spouse is entitled to receive, or is receiving, survivor benefits, a
waiver or an order does not affect that entitlement unless




(a)

the spouse waives the spouse's entitlement by giving notice in
accordance with section 136, or




(b)

the Supreme Court, in allocating all or part of the survivor benefits
to a person other than the spouse, refers expressly to this subsection
in the order making the allocation.




(3)

If a waiver or an order is made in accordance with subsection (2),




(a)

the administrator may consent to pay survivor benefits to a person
other than the spouse, but is not required to do so, and




(b)

if a person becomes entitled to survivor benefits as a result of the
waiver or order and receives an overpayment of the survivor benefits,
the person is liable to the administrator to repay the overpayment.




Division 5 — Other Matters Respecting Pension Division





Agreements respecting division




127

(1)


Despite any provision of this Part but subject to section 93
[setting aside agreements respecting property division]
, spouses may make a written agreement respecting the division of
benefits under a plan, including a written agreement doing one or more
the following:




(a)

determining the spouse's proportionate share of benefits in a manner
that would leave the member with less than half, or none, of the
member's benefits;




(b)

providing for the satisfaction of all or part of the spouse's interest
in the benefits by the member providing compensation to the spouse.




(2)

An agreement may provide that, despite the

Canada Pension Plan

, unadjusted pensionable earnings under that Act will not be divided
between the spouses.






Determining compensation




128

(1)


If, by an agreement or order, a member must provide compensation to a
spouse in satisfaction of all or part of the spouse's interest in
benefits under a plan, the compensation must be determined in
accordance with the regulations unless the agreement or order provides
otherwise.




(2)

If an administrator and a spouse enter into an agreement under which
the spouse accepts from the administrator compensation or a transfer
of a share of benefits, in satisfaction of the spouse's interest in
any circumstance not specifically dealt with under this Part, the
compensation or transfer must be calculated in accordance with the
regulations unless the Supreme Court orders otherwise.






Reapportioning benefits




129


The Supreme Court may reapportion to a spouse entitlement to all or
part of a member's benefits under a plan for the purpose of providing
the spouse with an independent source of income if




(a)

it is necessary, appropriate or convenient in the circumstances, and




(b)

the financial and property arrangements between the member and spouse
to address the spouse's need to become or remain economically
independent and self-sufficient would otherwise require an order




(i)

respecting spousal support, or




(ii)

requiring the member, after pension commencement, to pay the spouse a
share of the benefits under the plan, or under another plan, as they
are received.






Clarifying division of benefits




130


Despite section 215 (2)
[changing, suspending or terminating orders generally]
, on application by a member or spouse, the Supreme Court may at any
time give directions or make orders to facilitate or enforce the
division of benefits in accordance with an agreement or order.






Changing division of benefits in unusual circumstances




131

(1)


This section applies if the method of dividing benefits under this
Part will operate in a manner that is inappropriate given




(a)

the terms of the plan, or




(b)

any change to the terms of the plan after the date an agreement or
order is made to divide the benefits.




(2)

Despite section 215 (2)
[changing, suspending or terminating orders generally]
, on application by a member or spouse, the Supreme Court may direct
by order an appropriate method of dividing benefits, and the order is
binding on the administrator.




(3)

An application under this section




(a)

may be made at any time before benefits are divided, and




(b)

must be served on the administrator at least 30 days before the date
set for the hearing of the application.




(4)

The administrator may attend and make representations respecting the
effect on the plan of any proposed division of benefits under this
section.






Retroactive division of benefits




132

(1)


In this section,
"pension commencement date"
means the date chosen by a member, in accordance with the requirements
of a plan, to have the member's pension commence.




(2)

If commencement of a member's pension is delayed beyond the pension
commencement date because the member and the member's spouse, or
either of them, are seeking an agreement or order respecting the
division of benefits, both the member and the spouse are entitled to
receive their respective shares of benefits retroactive to the pension
commencement date if all of the following conditions are met:




(a)

before the pension commencement date, the member or spouse gives to
the administrator a copy of an agreement or order that prohibits the
member from dealing with benefits under the plan or with family
property generally;




(b)

on or before December 1 of the year following the year in which the
pension commencement date falls, the member or spouse gives to the
administrator a copy of an agreement or order




(i)

setting out the final terms of the division of benefits, and




(ii)

lifting the prohibition referred to in paragraph (a);




(c)

if approval from the Canada Revenue Agency is required to divide the
benefits as of the pension commencement date, the administrator,
before dividing the benefits, obtains that approval.




(3)

For the purposes of subsection (2), the rules respecting the division
of benefits before pension commencement, as set out in sections 114
[benefits determined under defined contribution provision]
, 115
[benefits determined under benefit formula provision]
and 116
[local hybrid plans]
, apply.




(4)

Nothing in this section limits the discretion of an administrator to
consent to, or the jurisdiction of a court to order, the retroactive
division of benefits in circumstances other than those set out in
subsection (2).

that required under subsection (1), if the different basis otherwise
complies with applicable law.

because of family violence or because the child's circumstances were,
considered objectively, intolerable.




(2)

If a child referred to in subsection (1) (b) returns to the child's
parents' or guardians' charge, their duty to provide support for the
child resumes.




(3)

(1)


If a court makes an order respecting child support, the amount of
child support must be determined in accordance with the child support
guidelines.

different from that required by the child support guidelines if




(a)

the parties consent under section 219
[persons may consent to order being made]
or have an agreement respecting child support, and




(b)

the court is satisfied that reasonable arrangements have been made for
the support of the child.




(3)

The court must consider the child support guidelines for the purposes
of subsection (2), but must not consider arrangements made for the
support of the child to be unreasonable only because the amount
required under the child support guidelines differs from those
arrangements.




(4)

Despite subsection (1), a court may order child support in an amount
different from that required by the child support guidelines if
satisfied that




(a)

an agreement or order respecting the financial duties of the parents
or guardians or the division or transfer of property, other than an
agreement respecting child support, benefits the child directly or
indirectly, or that special provisions have otherwise been made for
the benefit of the child, and




(b)

applying the child support guidelines would be inequitable on
consideration of the agreement, order or special provisions.




(5)

If a court makes an order respecting child support in an amount
different from that required under the child support guidelines, it
must give reasons for doing so.






If parentage at issue

Duty to provide support for entitled spouse




160

, a spouse is entitled to spousal support, the other spouse has a duty
to provide support for the spouse in accordance with section 162
[determining spousal support]
.






Objectives of spousal support




161


In determining entitlement to spousal support, the parties to an
agreement or the court must consider the following objectives:




(a)

to recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses
arising from the relationship between the spouses or the breakdown of
that relationship;




(b)

to apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising
from the care of their child, beyond the duty to provide support for
the child;




(c)

to relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the
breakdown of the relationship between the spouses;




(d)

as far as practicable, to promote the economic self-sufficiency of
each spouse within a reasonable period of time.






Determining spousal support




162


The amount and duration of spousal support, if any, must be determined
on consideration of the conditions, means, needs and other
circumstances of each spouse, including the following:




(a)

the length of time the spouses lived together;




(b)

the functions performed by each spouse during the period they lived
together;




(c)

an agreement between the spouses, or an order, relating to the support
of either spouse.






Agreements respecting spousal support




163

(1)


An agreement respecting spousal support may provide for the
circumstances under which spousal support will change or end,
including if a spouse lives with another person or enters a
relationship with another spouse, but a condition of spousal support
that the spouse abstain from sexual relations after separation is not
binding.




(2)

Despite section 160
[duty to provide support for entitled spouse]
, in making an agreement respecting spousal support, a spouse may
agree to release the other spouse from liability for spousal support.




(3)

A written agreement respecting spousal support that is filed in the
court is enforceable under this Act and the

Family Maintenance Enforcement Act

as if it were an order of the court.

spousal support, with the signature of each spouse witnessed by at
least one person.




(2)

For the purposes of subsection (1), the same person may witness each
signature.




(3)

circumstances existed when the parties entered into the agreement:




(a)

a spouse failed to disclose income, significant property or debts, or
other information relevant to the negotiation of the agreement;




(b)

a spouse took improper advantage of the other spouse's vulnerability,
including the other party's ignorance, need or distress;




(c)

a spouse did not understand the nature or consequences of the
agreement;




(d)

other circumstances that would under the common law cause all or part
of a contract to be voidable.




(4)

The court may decline to act under subsection (3) if, on consideration
of all of the evidence, the court would not replace the agreement with
an order that is substantially different from that set out in the
agreement.




(5)

Despite subsection (3), the court may set aside or replace with an
order made under this Division all or part of an agreement if
satisfied that none of the circumstances described in that subsection
existed when the parties entered into the agreement but that the
agreement is significantly unfair on consideration of the following:




(a)

the length of time that has passed since the agreement was made;




(b)

any changes, since the agreement was made, in the condition, means,
needs or other circumstances of a spouse;




(c)

the intention of the spouses, in making the agreement, to achieve
certainty;




(d)

the degree to which the spouses relied on the terms of the agreement;




(e)

the degree to which the agreement meets the objectives set out in
section 161
[objectives of spousal support]
.




(6)

Despite subsection (1), the court may apply this section to an
unwitnessed written agreement if the court is satisfied it would be
appropriate to do so in all of the circumstances.






Orders respecting spousal support

(c)

if the right to apply for an order under this section is assigned to a

Employment and Assistance Act

or the


Employment and Assistance for Persons with Disabilities Act


, by the minister to whom the right is assigned in the name of the
government or the name of the person who made the assignment.




(3)

The court may not make an order respecting spousal support if the
spouses have an agreement described in section 164 (1)
[setting aside agreements respecting spousal support]
, unless all or part of the agreement is set aside under that section.






Misconduct of spouse




166


In making an order respecting spousal support, the court must not
consider any misconduct of a spouse, except conduct that arbitrarily
or unreasonably




(a)

causes, prolongs or aggravates the need for spousal support, or

affects the ability to provide spousal support.






Changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting spousal support




167

evidence of a substantial nature that was not available during the

support for a definite period or until a specified event occurs, the
court, on an application made after the expiration of that period or
occurrence of that event, may not make an order under subsection (1)
for the purpose of resuming spousal support unless satisfied that




(a)

the order is necessary to relieve economic hardship that




(i)

arises from a change described in subsection (2) (a), and




(ii)

is related to the relationship between the spouses, and




(b)

the changed circumstances, had they existed at the time the order was
made, would likely have resulted in a different order.






Review of spousal support




168

(1)

review of spousal support, and for this purpose may provide for

the review to occur on or after a specified date, after a specified

the type of family dispute resolution by which the review will take

(ii)

either pay all premiums on the policy, or authorize the person's
spouse to pay all premiums on the policy and to compensate the spouse
for doing so;




(f)

that expenses arising from and incidental to prenatal care of a mother

;




(g)

subject to section 171 (1)
[support obligations after death]
, that a duty to pay child support or spousal support continues after
the death of the person having the duty, and is a debt of the person's
estate for the period fixed by the court.






Support obligations after death




171

(1)


Before making an order under section 170 (g)
[matters that may be provided for in support orders]
, the court must consider all of the following factors:




(a)

that the person receiving child support or spousal support has a
significant need for support that is likely to continue past the death
of the person paying child support or spousal support;




(b)

that the estate of the person paying child support or spousal support
is sufficient to meet the need referred to in paragraph (a) after
taking into account all claims on the estate, including those of
creditors and beneficiaries;




(c)

that no other practical means exist to meet the need referred to in
paragraph (a).




(2)

If an agreement, or an order under section 170 (g), is made and the
person having a duty to pay child support or spousal support dies, the
person's personal representative may make an application, and the
court may make an order, to




(a)

set aside or replace with an order made under this Part all or part of
the agreement, or




(b)

change, suspend or terminate the order.




(3)

If a person having a duty to pay child support or spousal support
under an agreement or order dies and the agreement or order is silent
respecting whether the duty continues after the death of the person
and is a debt of the person's estate,




(a)

the person receiving support may make an application under section 149
[orders respecting child support]
or 165
[orders respecting spousal support]
, and




(b)

if, on consideration of the factors set out in subsection (1) of this
section, an order is made, the duty to pay child support or spousal
support continues despite the death of the person and is a debt of the
person's estate for the period fixed by the court.






Separate support amounts required




172


If the court makes both an order for child support and an order for
spousal support, the court must specify the amounts of support
separately rather than as a single amount.






Priority of child support




173

(1)


In making an agreement or order respecting spousal support, the
parties to the agreement and the court must give priority to any duty
to pay child support.




(2)

If, as a result of giving priority to a duty to pay child support, the
parties do not make an agreement respecting spousal support or make an
agreement respecting spousal support in an amount that is less than it
otherwise would have been,




(a)

the agreement must indicate that the circumstances referred to in this
subsection apply, and




(b)

if child support is subsequently reduced or terminated,




(i)

the reduction or termination is a change in circumstances, and




(ii)

the court may make an order under section 165
[orders respecting spousal support]
.




(3)

If, as a result of giving priority to a duty to pay child support, a
court is unable to make an order respecting spousal support or makes
an order respecting spousal support in an amount that is less than it
otherwise would have been,




(a)

the court must give reasons for doing so, and




(b)

if child support is subsequently reduced or terminated,




(i)

the reduction or termination is a change in circumstances, and




(ii)

the court may make an order under section 165 or 167

[changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting spousal
support]

, as applicable.




(4)

Section 164
[setting aside agreements respecting spousal support]
does not apply to the making of an order under this section.






Reducing or cancelling arrears




174

(1)


On application, a court may reduce or cancel arrears owing under an
agreement or order respecting child support or spousal support if
satisfied that it would be grossly unfair not to reduce or cancel the
arrears.




(2)

For the purposes of this section, the court may consider




(a)

the efforts of the person responsible for paying support to comply
with the agreement or order respecting support,




(b)

the reasons why the person responsible for paying support cannot pay
the arrears owing, and




(c)

any circumstances that the court considers relevant.




(3)

If a court reduces arrears under this section, the court may order
that interest does not accrue on the reduced arrears if satisfied that
it would be grossly unfair not to make such an order.




(4)

If a court cancels arrears under this section, the court may cancel
interest that has accrued, under section 11.1 of the

Family Maintenance Enforcement Act

, on the cancelled arrears if satisfied that it would be grossly
unfair not to cancel the accrued interest.

Whether to make protection order

(a)

any history of family violence by the family member against whom the

whether any family violence is repetitive or escalating;

whether any psychological or emotional abuse constitutes, or is
evidence of, a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed

the current status of the relationship between the family member
against whom the order is to be made and the at-risk family member,
including any recent separation or intention to separate;

made that may increase the risk of family violence by that family
member, including substance abuse, employment or financial problems,

the at-risk family member's perception of risks to the at-risk family

any circumstance that may increase the at-risk family member's
vulnerability, including pregnancy, age, family circumstances, health
or economic dependence.

shelter or other safe place;
