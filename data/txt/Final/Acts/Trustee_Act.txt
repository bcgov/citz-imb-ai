Interpretation





13



For the purposes of section 14, a trustee is deemed to be engaged on war service






(a)


if the trustee is engaged in connection with a war in which Canada is a participant as a member of the military, naval or air forces of the Crown, or






(b)


if in connection with the war the trustee is a prisoner of war in an enemy country, or is interned in the country of a neutral power.








Trustee engaged on war service





14



(1)


A trustee, whether or not a sole trustee, who is engaged on war service and intends to leave British Columbia and remain out of British Columbia for a period exceeding one month, or who is engaged on war service out of British Columbia and does not intend to return within one month, may, despite any rule of law or equity to the contrary, by power of attorney delegate to any person, including a trust company, the execution or exercise of all or any trusts, powers and discretions vested in the trustee as trustee, either alone or jointly with any other person or persons, but a person who is the only other co-trustee must not be appointed to be an attorney under this subsection.






(2)


The donor of a power of attorney given under this section is liable for the acts or defaults of the donee in the same manner as if they were the acts or defaults of the donor.






(3)


The power of attorney does not come into operation unless and until the donor is out of British Columbia and is revoked by the donor's return.






(4)


The power of attorney must be attested by at least one witness.






(5)


All jurisdiction and powers of any court apply to the donee of a power of attorney given under this Act insofar as respects the execution of the trust in the same manner as if the donee were a trustee of the trust.






(6)


A signed statement by the donee of a power of attorney, under which the execution of a trust is delegated, that the donor is engaged on war service within the meaning of this Act and is out of British Columbia, and that in any transaction the donee is acting in execution of the trust, must be accepted as conclusive evidence of those facts by the court and all other persons dealing with the donee.






(7)


Subject to subsection (11), the


Power of Attorney Act


applies to powers of attorney given under this section.






(8)


In favour of a person dealing with the donee, any act done or instrument executed by the donee is, even though the power has never come into operation or has been revoked by the act of the donor or by the donor's death or otherwise, as valid and effectual as if the donor were alive and of full capacity and had done the act or executed the instrument, unless the person had actual notice that the power had never come into operation or of the revocation of the power before the act was done or instrument executed, or, unless in the case of an instrument within the meaning of section 1 of the


Land Title Act


before the registration of the instrument in the land title office of the land title district in which the land comprised in the instrument is located, notice of revocation by death or otherwise, or notice that the power has never come into operation, is filed in that land title office.






(9)


For the purpose of executing or exercising the trusts or powers delegated to the donee, the donee may, subject to any limitation contained in the power of attorney, exercise any of the powers conferred on the donor as trustee by statute or by the instrument creating the trust, including the power, for the purpose of the transfer of shares or inscribed stock, to delegate to an attorney power to transfer, but not including the power of delegation conferred by this section.






(10)


The fact that it appears from a power of attorney given under this section, or from evidence required for the purposes of that power of attorney or otherwise, that in dealing with shares or stock the donee of the power is acting in the execution of a trust must not be considered for any purpose to affect a person in whose books the shares or stock are inscribed or registered with notice of the trust.






(11)


The fact that the donor of a power to which this Act applies is reported "missing" or "missing and believed to be killed" does not give persons who have knowledge of such report actual or constructive notice of the death, although in fact the death has occurred.






(12)


A person who knowingly provides information that is false or misleading with respect to a material fact contained in a signed statement under subsection (6) commits an offence.






(13)


A person who produces or relies upon a signed statement given by another person under subsection (6) while knowing the signed statement to be false or misleading with respect to a material fact contained in that signed statement commits an offence.

Trustee not liable if overall investment strategy is prudent





15.3



A trustee is not liable for a loss to the trust arising from the investment of trust property if the conduct of the trustee that led to the loss conformed to a plan or strategy for the investment of the trust property, comprising reasonable assessments of risk and return, that a prudent investor would adopt under comparable circumstances.








Abrogation of common law rules: anti-netting rules





15.4



(1)


The rule of general trust law that requires the assessment of the decisions of a trustee on an investment by investment basis if the decisions are called into question is abrogated.






(2)


The rule for the assessment of damages for breach of trust that prohibits losses from being off set by gains is abrogated except in respect of circumstances in which the breach is associated with dishonesty on the part of the trustee.








Delegation of authority with respect to investment





15.5



(1)


In this section,

Investment in an investment fund referred to in section 15.1 (1) or a common trust fund referred to in section 15.1 (3) is not a delegation of authority with respect to the investment of trust property.








Interpretation of trust instrument in relation to sections 15.1 to 15.5





15.6



For the purposes of sections 15.1 to 15.5 and any investment made after the coming into force of this section, if the terms of the instrument that created a trust express the powers of the trustee as powers to invest property of the trust in the investments permitted under section 15 as that section read at any time before its repeal, the instrument is to be interpreted as authorizing the investments permitted under sections 15.1 to 15.5, unless a particular investment would be expressly authorized or expressly prohibited by the terms of the instrument.

(a)


call in trust funds invested in securities other than those authorized by this Act and invest them in securities authorized by this Act, and






(b)


vary any investments authorized by this Act.






(2)


A trustee is not liable for a breach of trust merely because the trustee continues to hold an investment that since its acquisition by the trustee has ceased to be one authorized by the instrument of trust or by this Act.






(3)


If a trustee has improperly advanced trust money on a mortgage that would at the time of the investment have been a proper investment in all respects for a less sum than was actually advanced, the security is deemed to be an authorized investment for the smaller sum, and the trustee is only liable to make good the excess amount advanced, with interest.








Reorganization of corporation





23



(1)


If a trustee holds securities of a corporation in which the trustee has properly invested money under this Act, the trustee may concur in a compromise, scheme or arrangement for

the reconstruction of the corporation or the winding up, sale or distribution of its assets,

(c)


the amalgamation of the corporation with another corporation, or






(d)

in a similar manner as if the trustee were entitled to the securities beneficially, and may, if the securities are in all other respects reasonable and proper investments, accept securities of any denomination or description of the reconstructed, purchasing or new corporation in place of or in exchange for all or any of the original securities.






(2)


A trustee is not responsible for loss caused by an act or thing done in good faith under subsection (1), and the trustee may, if the securities accepted under that subsection are in all other respects reasonable and proper investments, retain them for any period for which the trustee could have properly retained the original securities.








Income for maintenance of infant





24



(1)


If property is held by trustees in trust for an infant, either absolutely or contingently on the infant reaching 19 years of age or on the occurrence of any event before the infant reaches that age, the trustees may, at their sole discretion, pay to any guardians of the infant or otherwise apply for or toward the infant's maintenance or education, all or part of the income to which the infant may be entitled in respect of the property, whether or not there is a fund applicable to the same purpose or any other person bound by law to provide for the infant's maintenance or education.






(2)


The trustees must accumulate all the residue of the income referred to in subsection (1) by way of compound interest, by investing it and the resulting income of it from time to time in proper securities, for the benefit of the person who will ultimately become entitled to the property from which the accumulation has arisen, but the trustees may at any time, if it appears expedient to them, apply all or part of the accumulations as if they were part of the income arising in the then current year.








Sale of property to maintain infant





25



(1)


If any property is held by trustees in trust for an infant, either absolutely or contingently on the infant reaching 19 years of age or on the occurrence of any event before the infant reaches that age, and if the income arising from that property is insufficient for the maintenance and education of the infant, the trustees may, by leave of the court to be obtained in a summary manner, sell and dispose of any portion of the property, and pay any guardians of the infant or otherwise apply for or toward the infant's maintenance or education all or part of the money arising from the sale.






(2)

apply the money referred to in paragraph (a) and the proceeds of it from time to time for the education and maintenance of the infant, and






(c)


hold the residue of the money and interest on it not required for the education and maintenance of the infant for the benefit of the person who will ultimately become entitled to the property from which the money and interest have arisen.








Conveyance and receipt of trustees gives good title





26



On any sale made under section 25, the deed of conveyance duly executed by the trustees and the receipt for the purchase money duly signed by the trustees convey a good title to the purchaser of the property purporting to be conveyed, and effectually exonerate the person paying the money from seeing to its application or from being answerable for its loss or misapplication.








Power to appoint new trustees





27



(1)


If a trustee, either original or substituted and whether appointed by any court or otherwise, is dead, remains out of British Columbia for more than 12 months, wishes to be discharged from all or any of the trusts or powers reposed in or conferred on the trustee, refuses or is unfit to act in them, or is incapable of acting in them, then the person nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees by any instrument creating the trust, or if there is no such person or no such person able and willing to act, then the surviving or continuing trustees for the time being, or the personal representatives of the last surviving or continuing trustee, may by writing appoint another person or persons to be a trustee or trustees in the place of the trustee who is dead, remains out of British Columbia, wishes to be discharged, refuses or is unfit or incapable.

(c)


it is not obligatory to appoint more than one new trustee if only one trustee was originally appointed, or to fill up the original number of trustees if more than 2 trustees were originally appointed but, except in a case in which only one trustee was originally appointed, a trustee must not be discharged under this section from the trustee's trust unless there will be at least 2 trustees to perform the trust, and






(d)


the assurances or things required for vesting the trust property or any part of it jointly in the persons who are the trustees must be executed or done.






(3)


A new trustee appointed under this section, as well before as after all the trust property becomes by law, by assurance or otherwise vested in the trustee, has the same powers, authorities and discretions, and may in all respects act as if the trustee had been originally appointed a trustee by any instrument creating the trust.

(a)


a trustee who is dead include the case of a person who is nominated a trustee in a will but who dies before the will-maker, and

(2)


If a deed by which a retiring trustee is discharged under this Act contains a declaration referred to in this section by the retiring and continuing trustees, and by any other person, if any, empowered to appoint trustees, that declaration operates, without a conveyance or assignment, to vest in the continuing trustees alone, as joint tenants, and for the purposes of the trust, the estate, interest or right to which the declaration relates.






(3)


This section does not extend to land conveyed by way of mortgage for securing money subject to the trust, or to a share, stock, annuity or property that is only transferable in books kept by a company or other body, or in a manner directed under any Act of the Legislature.

This section applies only to deeds executed after July 1, 1905.








Removal of trustees on application





30



A trustee or receiver appointed by any court may be removed and a trustee, trustees or receiver substituted in place of the trustee or receiver, at any time on application to the court by any trust beneficiary who is not under legal disability, with the consent and approval of a majority in interest and number of the trust beneficiaries who are also not under legal disability.








Power of court to appoint new trustees





31



If it is expedient to appoint a new trustee and it is found inexpedient, difficult or impracticable to do so without the assistance of the court, it is lawful for the court to make an order appointing a new trustee or trustees, whether there is an existing trustee or not at the time of making the order, and either in substitution for or in addition to any existing trustees.








Rights and powers of new trustees





32



The persons who, on the making of an order under section 31, are trustees have the same rights and powers as they would have had if appointed by a decree or judgment in a proceeding.








Power of court to vest land in new trustees





33



The court, on making an order appointing a new trustee, may, by that order or a subsequent order, direct that land subject to the trust vests in the person or persons who on the appointment are trustees for the estate that the court directs and the order has the same effect as if the persons who before the order were the trustees, if any, had duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for the estate.








Power of new trustees to transfer stock or chose in action





34



The court, on making an order appointing a new trustee, may, by that order or a subsequent order, vest the right to call for a transfer of a stock subject to the trust, or to receive the dividends or income of it, or to sue for or recover a chose in action subject to the trust, or any interest in respect of it, in the person or persons who on the appointment are trustees.








New trustees in place of persons convicted of indictable offence





35



(1)


If a person is jointly or solely seised or possessed of land, or entitled to stock on a trust, and the person has been or is convicted of an indictable offence, the court may, on proof of the conviction, appoint a person to be a trustee in the place of the convict, and make an order for vesting the land, or the right to transfer the stock, and to receive the dividends or income of it, in the person appointed.






(2)


An order made under subsection (1) has the same effect with respect to land as if the convict trustee had been free from any disability, and had duly executed a conveyance or assignment of the convict trustee's estate and interest in it.








Persons who may apply for orders





36



(1)


An order under any of the above provisions for the appointment of a new trustee, or concerning land, stock or a chose in action subject to a trust, may be made on the application of any person beneficially interested in the land, stock or chose in action, whether under disability or not, or on the application of a person duly appointed as a trustee of it.






(2)


An order under any of the above provisions concerning land, stock or a chose in action subject to a mortgage may be made on the application of any person beneficially interested in the equity of redemption, whether under disability or not, or of any person interested in the money secured by the mortgage.








Old trustees not discharged from liability





37



The appointment by the court of new trustees, and any conveyance, assignment or transfer mentioned above, operates no further or otherwise as a discharge to a former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees under a power for that purpose contained in an instrument would have done.

Setting remuneration of trustees and guardians





88



(1)


A trustee under a deed, settlement or will, an executor or administrator, a guardian appointed by any court, a testamentary guardian, or any other trustee, however the trust is created, is entitled to, and it is lawful for the Supreme Court, or a registrar of that court if so directed by the court, to allow them a fair and reasonable allowance, not exceeding 5% on the gross aggregate value, including capital and income, of all the assets of the estate by way of remuneration for their care, pains and trouble and their time spent in and about the trusteeship, executorship, guardianship or administration of the estate and effects vested in them under any will or grant of administration, and in administering, disposing of and arranging and settling the same, and generally in arranging and settling the affairs of the estate as the court, or a registrar of the court if so directed by the court thinks proper.






(2)


The court or a registrar of the court if so directed by the court, may make an order under subsection (1) from time to time, and the amount of remuneration must be allowed to an executor, trustee, guardian or administrator, in passing their accounts, in addition to any other allowances for expenses actually incurred to which the trustee, executor, guardian or administrator may by law be entitled.






(3)


A person entitled to an allowance under subsection (1) may apply annually to the Supreme Court for a care and management fee and the court may allow a fee not exceeding 0.4% of the average market value of the assets.








Application for remuneration





89



The court may, on application to it for the purpose, settle or direct the registrar to settle the amount of the compensation, although the estate is not before the court in an action.








Application

Nothing in section 88 or 89 applies in any case in which the allowance is set by the instrument creating the trust.








Review of order or certificate of registrar

(2)


Unless varied or discharged by the court, the order or certificate is binding on the trustee, executor, administrator or guardian, and all parties interested in the trust estate.








Loans by trustees not breach of trust





92



(1)


A trustee lawfully lending money on the security of property is not chargeable with breach of trust merely because of the proportion borne by the amount of the loan to the value of the property at the time when the loan was made, if it appears to the court that






(a)


in making the loan the trustee was acting on a report of the value of the property made by a person whom the trustee reasonably believed to be a valuator who was competent and independent of any owner of the property, whether the valuator carried on business in the locality where the property is located or elsewhere,






(b)


the amount of the loan did not exceed 75% of the value of the property stated in the report, and






(c)


the loan was made on the advice of the valuator expressed in the report.






(2)


A trustee lending money on the security of any leasehold property is not chargeable with breach of trust only on the ground that in making the loan the trustee dispensed either wholly or partly with the production or investigation of the lessor's title.






(3)


A trustee is not chargeable with breach of trust only on the ground that in effecting the purchase of or in lending money on the security of any property the trustee has accepted a shorter title than the title that a purchaser is, in the absence of a special contract, entitled to require if, in the opinion of the court, the title accepted is such as a person acting with prudence and caution would have accepted.








Improper advance of trust money on mortgage





93



If a trustee improperly advances trust money on a mortgage security that would at the time of the investment be a proper investment in all respects for a smaller sum than is actually advanced, the security is deemed to be an authorized investment for the smaller sum, and the trustee is only liable to make good the excess sum advanced, with interest.








Exoneration of trustees on powers of attorney





94



(1)


A trustee acting or paying money in good faith under or in pursuance of a power of attorney is not liable for the act or payment because of the fact that at the time of the payment or act the person who gave the power of attorney was dead or had done some act to avoid the power, if this fact was not known to the trustee at the time the trustee acted or paid.






(2)


This section does not affect the right of a person entitled to the money against the person to whom the payment is made, and the person entitled has the same remedy against the person to whom the payment is made as the person entitled would have had against the trustee.








Implied indemnity of trustees





95



A trustee, without prejudice to the provisions of any instrument creating the trust, is chargeable only for money and securities actually received by the trustee even though the trustee signed a receipt for the sake of conformity, and is answerable and accountable only for the trustee's own acts, receipts, neglects or defaults, and not for those of other trustees or a banker, broker or other person with whom trust money or securities may be deposited, nor for the insufficiency or deficiency of securities or any other loss, unless it happens through the trustee's own wilful default, and may reimburse themselves, or pay or discharge out of the trust premises, all expenses incurred in or about the execution of the trustee's trusts or powers.








Jurisdiction of court to relieve trustee of breach of trust





96



If it appears to the court that a trustee, however appointed, is or may be personally liable for a breach of trust, whenever the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which the trustee committed the breach, then the court may relieve the trustee either wholly or partly from that personal liability.








Appointment and remuneration of judicial trustees





97



(1)


If an application is made to the court by or on behalf of the person creating or intending to create a trust, or by or on behalf of a trustee or beneficiary, the court may, in its discretion, appoint a judicial trustee to be a trustee of that trust, either jointly with any other person or as sole trustee, and, if sufficient cause is shown, in place of all existing trustees.






(2)


The administration of the property of a deceased person, whether a will-maker or intestate, is a trust, and the executor or administrator a trustee, within the meaning of this section and sections 96 and 98.






(3)


Any fit and proper person nominated for the purpose in the application may be appointed a judicial trustee, and in the absence of a nomination, or if the court is not satisfied of the fitness of a person so nominated, an official of the court may be appointed, and in any case a judicial trustee is subject to the control and supervision of the court as an officer of it.






(4)


The court may, either on request or without request, give to a judicial trustee general or special directions in regard to the trust or its administration.






(5)


A judicial trustee may be paid out of the trust property the remuneration, not exceeding the prescribed limits, that the court assigns in each case, subject to any rules under this Act respecting the application of that remuneration where the judicial trustee is an official of the court, and the remuneration so assigned to a judicial trustee, except as the court may for special reasons otherwise order, must cover all the judicial trustee's work and personal outlay.






(6)


Once in every year the accounts of every trust of which a judicial trustee has been appointed must be audited, and a report on them made to the court by the persons specified by the rules made under section 98, and, in any case if the court so directs, an inquiry into the administration by a judicial trustee of a trust, or into a dealing or transaction of a judicial trustee, must be made in the manner specified by those rules.
