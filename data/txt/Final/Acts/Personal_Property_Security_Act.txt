Residual priority rules





35



(1)


If this Act does not provide another method for determining priority between security interests,

(ii)


possession of the collateral in accordance with section 24 without regard to the date of attachment of the security interest;

a perfected security interest has priority over an unperfected security interest, and

priority among unperfected security interests is determined by the order of attachment of the security interests.






(2)


For the purposes of subsection (1), a continuously perfected security interest must be treated at all times as perfected by the method by which it was originally perfected.






(3)


Subject to section 28 for the purposes of subsection (1), the time of registration, possession or perfection of a security interest in original collateral is also the time of registration, possession or perfection of its proceeds.

A security interest in goods that are equipment and that are of a kind defined in the regulations as serial numbered goods is not registered or perfected by registration for the purposes of subsection (1), (7) or (8) unless a financing statement relating to the security interest and containing a description of the goods by serial number is registered.






(5)


Subject to subsection (6), the priority that a security interest has under subsection (1) applies to all advances, including future advances.






(6)


A perfected security interest has priority over the interest of persons referred to in section 20 (a) only to the extent of

(i)


the interests of the persons,

.






(7)


If registration of a security interest lapses as a result of failure to renew the registration or if a registration has been discharged without authorization or in error, and the secured party re-registers the security interest not later than 30 days after the lapse or discharge, the lapse or discharge does not affect the priority status of the security interest in relation to a competing perfected security interest that immediately before the lapse or discharge had a subordinate priority position, except to the extent that the competing security interest secures advances made or contracted for after the lapse or discharge and before the re-registration.






(8)


If a debtor transfers an interest in collateral which, at the time of the transfer, is subject to a perfected security interest, that security interest has priority over any other security interest granted by the transferee before the transfer, except to the extent that the security interest granted by the transferee secures advances made, or contracted for,






(a)


after the expiry of 15 days from the day the secured party who holds the security interest in the transferred collateral has knowledge of the information required to register a financing statement disclosing the transferee as the new debtor, and






(b)


before the secured party referred to in paragraph (a) amends the registration to disclose the name of the transferee as the new debtor or takes possession of the collateral.

Transfer of debtors' interests in collateral or change of debtors





51



(1)


If a security interest has been perfected by registration and the debtor transfers all or part of the interest in the collateral with the prior consent of the secured party, the security interest in the transferred collateral is subordinate to






(a)


an interest, other than a security interest in the transferred collateral, arising in the period from the expiry of the 15th day after the transfer to, but not including, the day the secured party amends the registration to name the transferee of the collateral as the new debtor or takes possession of the collateral,






(b)


a perfected security interest in the transferred collateral registered or perfected in the period referred to in paragraph (a), and






(c)


a perfected security interest in the transferred collateral registered or perfected after the transfer and before the expiry of the 15th day after the transfer if, before the expiry of the 15 days,






(i)


the registration of the security interest first referred to in this subsection is not amended to disclose the transferee of the interest in the collateral as the new debtor, or






(ii)


the secured party does not take possession of the collateral.






(2)


If a security interest is perfected by registration and the secured party has knowledge of






(a)


information required to register a financing change statement showing the transferee as the new debtor, where all or part of the debtor's interest in the collateral has been transferred, or






(b)


the new name of the debtor, where there has been a change in the debtor's name,


the security interest in the collateral transferred, where paragraph (a) applies, and in the collateral, where paragraph (b) applies, is subordinate to






(c)


an interest, other than a security interest, in the collateral, arising in the period from the expiry of the 15th day after the secured party has knowledge of information referred to in paragraph (a) or the new name of the debtor, to, but not including, the day the secured party amends the registration to name the transferee of the collateral as the new debtor or to indicate the new name of the debtor, or takes possession of the collateral,






(d)


a perfected security interest in the collateral registered or perfected in the period referred to in paragraph (c), or






(e)


a perfected security interest in the collateral registered or perfected after the secured party has knowledge of the information referred to in paragraph (a) or of the new name of the debtor, and before the expiry of the 15th day referred to in paragraph (c), if before the expiry of the 15 days






(i)


the registration of the security interest first mentioned in this subsection is not amended to disclose the transferee of the collateral as the new debtor or to disclose the new name of the debtor, or






(ii)


the secured party does not take possession of the collateral.






(3)


This section does not have the effect of subordinating a prior security interest under prior registration law deemed under section 78 to be registered under this Act.






(4)


If the debtor's interest in part or all of the collateral is transferred without the consent of the secured party and there are one or more subsequent transfers of the collateral without the consent of the secured party before the secured party acquires knowledge of the name of the transferee who has possession of the collateral, the secured party is deemed to have complied with subsection (2) if the secured party registers a financing change statement not later than 15 days after acquiring knowledge of






(a)


the name of the transferee who has possession of the collateral, and






(b)


the information required to register a financing change statement,


or the secured party need not register financing change statements with respect to any intermediate transferee.

Recovery of loss caused by error in registry





52



(1)


Despite section 69, the government is not liable either directly or vicariously for loss or damage suffered by a person because of






(a)


verbal advice given by an agent or employee of the government respecting this Act, regulations made under this Act or the operation of the registry unless the person who brings the action proves that the agent or employee was not acting in good faith, or






(b)


failure to register or to register correctly data authorized under the regulations to be transmitted electronically, directly to the computer data base of the registry by a person defined in the regulations as a registering party, to effect a registration.






(2)


If an action is brought against the government for the recovery of loss or damage that results from the failure of the registrar to register a financing statement submitted for registration under section 43 (1), it is a defence to the action that the failure to register was because






(a)


the applicant did not pay the fee or make arrangements referred to in section 43 (3),






(b)


the registrar had refused to register due to circumstances referred to in section 42 (5), or






(c)


the registrar had refused to register under section 43 (12).






(3)


Nothing in this section limits any defences that would be available to the government in the absence of this section.








Recovery of loss if trust deeds involved





53



If an action is brought by a trustee under a trust indenture or by a person with an interest in a trust indenture, proof that each person relied on the search result is not necessary if it is established that the trustee relied on the search result, but no person is entitled to recover damages under section 52 if the person knows at the time the person loans money to the debtor that the search result relied on by the trustee is incorrect.








General





54



(1)


If a claim is paid to a claimant under the


Crown Proceeding Act


, the government is subrogated to the rights of the claimant against any person indebted to the claimant whose debt to the claimant was the basis of the loss or damage in respect of which the claim was paid.






(2)


If the claimant recovers an amount less than the value of the interest the claimant would have had if the loss or damage had not occurred, the right of subrogation under subsection (1) does not prejudice the ability of the claimant to recover in priority to the government an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid to the claimant and the value of the interest the claimant would have had if the loss or damage had not occurred.






(3)


No action for damages may be brought against the government unless it is commenced not later than one year after the person entitled to bring the action became aware of the loss or damage.






(4)


No action may be brought against the government to recover loss or damage caused by






(a)


reliance on a printed search result, or






(b)


the failure of the registrar to register a financing statement submitted for registration,


after the first to occur of






(c)


the limitation period referred to in subsection (3), and






(d)


the expiry of 6 years from the date that the search result was issued or the financing statement was submitted for registration.






(5)


Despite section 69, agents and employees of the government are not liable in their personal or official capacities for loss or damage suffered by a person because of anything done or omitted to be done in the exercise or purported exercise of a power or duty under this Act unless the plaintiff proves that the agent or employee was not acting in good faith.






(6)


Subsection (5) does not absolve the government from vicarious liability arising out of an act or omission of an agent or employee of the government for which act or omission the government would be liable if this section were not in force.

the debtor's unperformed obligations under

the security agreement, or

a related agreement, other than a mortgage on land executed before July 1, 1973, and

are extinguished.






(3)

(a)


the exercise of rights referred to in section 58 (2) (a) with respect to the consumer goods, or






(b)


the acceptance of the consumer goods under subsection (1) (c) of this section.

(7)


When the total amount received by the secured party as a result of legal proceedings to enforce a judgment against the debtor or proceedings to enforce a lien against the goods referred to in subsection (1) is equal to the gross amount realized from the sale of the goods under the proceedings,

any remaining liability of the debtor under a judgment obtained by the secured party through an exercise of the secured party's rights under subsection (1) (d), and






(b)


the obligations of a guarantor of or indemnitor with respect to the obligations of the debtor under the security agreement,


are discharged.






(8)


If a secured party proceeds under subsection (1) (a) or (d) and it is discovered after seizure or repossession that an accession which was collateral under the security agreement has been removed and not replaced by other goods of equivalent value and free from any prior security interest, nothing in subsection (2), (5) or (6) bars the secured party from proceeding to recover or to enforce a judgment against the debtor or a guarantor of, or indemnitor with respect to, the obligations of the debtor under the security agreement to the extent of the value of the accession.






(9)


If through wilful or reckless acts or neglect on the part of the debtor or on the part of anyone in possession of the goods with the consent of the debtor, the goods have been substantially damaged or have been allowed to deteriorate to an extent greater than that which would normally be expected with respect to goods of that kind, a court, on application, may order that subsections (1) to (7) or any one or more of them do not apply so as to limit the rights and remedies of the secured party as otherwise provided in this Part.






(10)


If the secured party brings an action or takes proceedings under subsection (1) (d),

(2)


All rights, duties or obligations arising under a security agreement, this Act or any other law applicable to security agreements or security interests must be exercised or discharged in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.






(3)


A person does not act in bad faith merely because the person acts with knowledge of the interest of some other person.








Consequences of non-compliance with Act





69



(1)


In this section,

"secured party"

includes a receiver.






(2)


A person to whom a duty or obligation is owed under this Act has a cause of action against any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to discharge the duty or perform the obligation.






(3)


Subject to subsection (5) in an action under subsection (2), the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from the defendant for losses that are reasonably foreseeable as being liable to result from the failure to discharge the duty or perform the obligation.






(4)


The Lieutenant Governor in Council may prescribe damages in respect of actions brought under subsection (2) in the following circumstances:






(a)


actions where the plaintiff is a debtor and the cause of action is for failure to comply with section 43 (15), 49, 50, 58 or 67;






(b)


actions where the plaintiff is the debtor, the collateral is consumer goods and the cause of action is for failure to comply with section 17, 18, 59, 60 or 61;






(c)


actions where the plaintiff is the person named as the debtor in a notice or registered financing statement, and the cause of action is for failure to comply with section 43 (15), 49 or 50.






(5)


If






(a)


damages have been prescribed under subsection (4) in respect of a cause of action referred to in that subsection, and

the court finds that the defendant is liable in respect of the cause of action,


the court must award the prescribed damages to the plaintiff, unless the actual damages exceed the prescribed damages in which case the court may award the actual damages.






(6)

(7)


In an action for a deficiency, the defendant may raise as a defence the failure on the part of the secured party to comply with obligations in section 17, 18, 59 or 60, but non-compliance limits the right to the deficiency only to the extent that it has affected the ability of the defendant to protect the defendant's interest in the collateral or has made the accurate determination of the deficiency impracticable.






(8)


If a secured party fails to comply with obligations in section 17, 18, 59 or 60, the onus is on the secured party to show that the failure






(a)


if the collateral is consumer goods, did not affect the debtor's ability to protect the debtor's interest in the collateral by redemption or reinstatement of the security agreement or otherwise, or






(b)


did not make the accurate determination of the deficiency impracticable.






(9)


Except as otherwise provided in this Act, a provision in a security agreement or any other agreement that purports to exclude a duty or onus imposed by this Act or that purports to limit the liability of or the amount of damages recoverable from a person who has failed to discharge a duty or obligation imposed by this Act is void.
