(3)


If private land is taken under subsection (1) without the consent of the owner of the land or of a person having or claiming an estate, right, title or interest in, to or out of the land, the

If proceedings under the


Expropriation Act


have the effect of amending a plan that has previously been approved by the minister under subsection (1), those proceedings take precedence, but the recorded holder must submit an amended plan, with information and particulars, to the minister, and must obtain approval for the amended plan from the minister before taking and using land for a right of way under this Act.

Unless the written consent or permit required for a right of way on Crown land under section 3 provides otherwise, the recipient of the written consent or holder of the permit is deemed to be the owner of the facilities placed in the right of way until the earlier of the date when
