Proportionate contributions

if more than one contract contains a deductible clause, the prorated proportions of the insurers under those contracts must be first ascertained without regard to the deductible clauses, and then the highest deductible must be prorated among the insurers with deductibles, and these prorated amounts affect the amount of recovery under those contracts.






(5)


Nothing in subsection (4) is to be construed to have the effect of increasing the prorated contribution of an insurer under a contract that is not subject to a deductible clause.

An insurer must not provide in a contract that includes coverage for loss or damage by fire, or another peril prescribed by regulation, an exclusion relating to the circumstances of the fire or peril if those circumstances are prescribed by regulation.






(3)


An exclusion contrary to subsection (1) or (2) is invalid.






(4)


For greater certainty, subsections (1) and (2) apply in relation to loss or damage by fire, however the fire is caused and in whatever circumstances and whether the coverage is under a part of the contract specifically covering loss or damage by fire or under another part.








Fire perils insured against





34



(1)


A contract that includes coverage for loss or damage by fire is deemed to cover the insured property against loss or damage caused by






(a)


lightning, or






(b)


an explosion of natural gas or manufactured gas






(i)


in a building that does not form part of a gasworks,






(ii)


from a cause, other than a cause excluded under section 33 (1), and






(iii)


whether or not fire ensues.






(2)


The coverage described in subsection (1) (a) does not include coverage against loss of or damage to electrical devices or appliances caused by lightning or other electrical currents, unless a fire






(a)


originates outside the device or appliance, and






(b)


causes the loss or damage.






(3)


Unless a contract that includes coverage for loss or damage by fire specifically provides otherwise, the contract does not cover insured property against loss or damage caused by contamination by radioactive material, resulting directly or indirectly from fire, lightning or an explosion described in subsection (1) (b).






(4)


If property






(a)


is insured at a specified location, and






(b)


is necessarily removed from the specified location to prevent loss or damage, or further loss or damage, to the property,


that part of the insurance that exceeds the amount of the insurer's liability for any loss or damage incurred before the date of removal must cover, for 7 days or for the unexpired term of the contract, whichever is the shorter period, the property removed from, and any property remaining at, the specified location on a prorated basis in accordance with the value of the property at each location.








Recovery by innocent persons





35



(1)


Despite section 5, if a contract contains a term or condition excluding coverage for loss or damage to property caused by a criminal or intentional act or omission of an insured or any other person, the exclusion applies only to the claim of a person






(a)


whose act or omission caused the loss or damage,






(b)


who abetted or colluded in the act or omission,






(c)


who






(i)


consented to the act or omission, and






(ii)


knew or ought to have known that the act or omission would cause the loss or damage, or






(d)


who is in a class prescribed by regulation.






(2)


Nothing in subsection (1) allows a person whose property is insured under the contract to recover more than their proportionate interest in the lost or damaged property.






(3)


A person whose coverage under a contract would be excluded but for subsection (1) must comply with any requirements prescribed by regulation.








Subrogation





36



(1)


The insurer, on making a payment or assuming liability under a contract, is subrogated to all rights of recovery of the insured against any person, and may bring an action in the name of the insured to enforce those rights.






(2)


If the net amount recovered after deducting the costs of recovery is not sufficient to provide a complete indemnity for the loss or damage suffered, that amount must be divided between the insurer and the insured in the proportions in which the loss or damage has been borne by them respectively.

the person reasonably believes that their life or health might be endangered by the insurance on their life continuing under that contract,

(a)


the policy is delivered to an insured, the insured's assign or agent, or to a beneficiary,






(b)


payment of the initial premium is made to the insurer or its agent, and






(c)


no change has taken place in the insurability of the life to be insured between the time the application was completed and the time the policy was delivered.






(2)


If a policy is issued on the terms applied for and is delivered to an agent of the insurer for unconditional delivery to a person referred to in subsection (1) (a), it is deemed, but not to the prejudice of the insured, to have been delivered to the insured.








Payment of premiums





49



(1)


If a cheque or other bill of exchange, or a promissory note or other written promise to pay, is given for the whole or a part of a premium and the cheque, bill of exchange, promissory note or other promise to pay is not honoured according to its tenor, the premium or the part of the premium has not been paid.






(2)


If a remittance for or on account of a premium is sent in a registered letter to an insurer and is received by it, the remittance is deemed to have been received at the time of the registration of the letter.








Payment of premiums and grace periods





50



(1)


Except in the case of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, an assignee of a contract, a beneficiary or a person acting on behalf of one of them or of the insured may pay any premium that the insured is entitled to pay.






(2)


If a premium, other than the initial premium, is not paid at the time it is due, the premium may be paid within a period of grace of






(a)


30 days, or in the case of an industrial contract 28 days, from and excluding the day on which the premium is due, or






(b)


the number of days, if any, specified in the contract for payment of an overdue premium,


whichever is the longer period.






(3)


If the happening of the event on which the insurance money becomes payable occurs during the period of grace and before the overdue premium is paid, the contract is deemed to be in effect as if the premium had been paid at the time it was due, and, except in the case of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, the amount of the premium may be deducted from the insurance money.








Duty to disclose





51



(1)


An applicant for insurance and a person whose life is to be insured must each disclose to the insurer in the application, on a medical examination, if any, and in any written statements or answers furnished as evidence of insurability, every fact within the applicant's or person's knowledge that is material to the insurance and is not so disclosed by the other.






(2)


Subject to section 52 and subsection (3) of this section, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact referred to in subsection (1) renders the contract voidable by the insurer.






(3)


A failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact referred to in subsection (1) relating to evidence of insurability with respect to an application for






(a)


additional coverage under a contract,






(b)


an increase in insurance under a contract, or






(c)


any other change to insurance after the policy is issued


renders the contract voidable by the insurer, but only in relation to the addition, increase or change.








Failure to disclose





52



(1)


This section does not apply to






(a)


a misstatement to an insurer of the age of a person whose life is insured, or






(b)


insurance under which an insurer, as part of a contract, undertakes to pay insurance money or to provide other benefits in the event the person whose life is insured becomes disabled as a result of bodily injury or disease.






(2)


Subject to subsection (3), if a contract, or an addition, increase or change referred to in section 51 (3), has been in effect for 2 years during the lifetime of the person whose life is insured, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact required to be disclosed by section 51 does not, in the absence of fraud, render the contract voidable.






(3)


In the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact required by section 51 to be disclosed in respect of a person whose life is insured under the contract does not render the contract voidable, but






(a)


if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of application for the insurance in respect of the person, the insurance in respect of that person is voidable by the insurer, and






(b)


if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of application for an addition, increase or change referred to in section 51 (3) in respect of the person, the addition, increase or change in respect of that person is voidable by the insurer,


unless the insurance, addition, increase or change has been in effect for 2 years during the lifetime of that person, in which case the insurance, addition, increase or change is not, in the absence of fraud, voidable.








Nondisclosure by insurer





53



If an insurer fails to disclose or misrepresents a fact material to the insurance, the contract is voidable by the insured, but in the absence of fraud the contract is not by reason of such failure or misrepresentation voidable after the contract has been in effect for 2 years.








Misstatement of age





54



(1)


This section does not apply to a contract of group insurance or of creditor's group insurance.






(2)


Subject to subsection (3), if the age of a person whose life is insured is misstated to the insurer, the insurance money provided by the contract must be increased or decreased to the amount that would have been provided for the same premium at the correct age.






(3)


If a contract limits insurable age and the correct age of the person whose life is insured exceeds that limit at the date of the application, the contract is voidable by the insurer for 5 years after the date the contract takes effect, but not afterwards, and only if






(a)


that person is alive, and






(b)


the insurer voids the contract within 60 days after it discovers the misstatement of age.








Misstatement of age in group insurance





55



In the case of a contract of group insurance or of creditor's group insurance, a misstatement to the insurer of the age of a person whose life is insured does not of itself render the contract voidable, and the provisions, if any, of the contract with respect to age or misstatement of age apply.








Effect of suicide on contract





56



(1)


If a contract contains an undertaking, express or implied, that insurance money will be paid if a person whose life is insured commits suicide, the undertaking is lawful and enforceable.






(2)


If a contract provides that in case a person whose life is insured commits suicide within a certain period of time the contract is void or the amount payable under it is reduced, if the contract lapses and is subsequently reinstated on one or more occasions, the period of time begins to run from the date of the latest reinstatement.








Reinstatement of contract





57



(1)


This section does not apply to a contract of group insurance or creditor's group insurance or to a contract made by a fraternal society.






(2)


If a contract lapses at the end of a period of grace because a premium due at the beginning of the period of grace was not paid, the contract may be reinstated by payment of the overdue premium within a further period of 30 days after the end of the period of grace, but only if the person whose life was insured under the contract is alive at the time payment is made.






(3)


If a contract lapses and is not reinstated under subsection (2), the insurer must reinstate it if, within 2 years after the date the contract lapsed, the insured






(a)


applies for the reinstatement,






(b)


pays to the insurer all overdue premiums and other indebtedness under the contract, together with interest not exceeding the rate determined under section 7 of the


Court Order Interest Act


, and






(c)


produces evidence satisfactory to the insurer of the good health and insurability of the person whose life was insured.






(4)


Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the cash surrender value has been paid or an option of taking paid up or extended insurance has been exercised.






(5)


Sections 51 and 52 apply, so far as applicable and with the necessary changes, to reinstatement of a contract.








Termination and replacement of group policies





58



(1)


If a contract of group insurance, or a benefit provision in a contract of group insurance, under which the insurer undertakes to pay insurance money or provide other benefits if a group life insured becomes disabled as a result of bodily injury or disease is terminated, the insurer continues, as though the contract or benefit provision had remained in full force and effect, to be liable to pay insurance money or provide benefits in respect of a group life insured for liability arising from an accident or disease that occurred before the termination of the contract or benefit provision if the disability is reported to the insurer within the 6 month period following the termination or a longer continuous period specified in the contract.






(2)


Despite subsection (1), an insurer does not remain liable under a contract or benefit provision described in that subsection to pay insurance money or provide a benefit for the recurrence of a disability after both of the following occur:






(a)


the termination of the contract or benefit provision;






(b)


a continuous period of 6 months, or any longer period provided in the contract, during which the group life insured was not disabled.






(3)


An insurer that is liable under subsection (1) to pay insurance money or provide a benefit as a result of the disability of a group life insured is not liable to pay the insurance money or provide the benefit for any period longer than the portion remaining, at the date the disability began, of the maximum period provided under the contract for the payment of insurance money or the provision of a benefit in respect of a disability of the group life insured.






(4)


If a contract of group insurance, in this subsection called the "replacement contract", is entered into within 31 days after the termination of another contract of group insurance, in this subsection called the "other contract", and that replacement contract insures some or all of the same group life insureds as the other contract,






(a)


the replacement contract is deemed to provide that any person who was insured under the other contract at the time of its termination is insured under the replacement contract from and after the termination of the other contract if






(i)


the insurance on that person under the other contract terminated by reason only of the termination of the other contract, and






(ii)


the person is a member of a class eligible for insurance under the replacement contract, and






(b)


no person who was insured under the other contract at the time of its termination may be excluded from eligibility under the replacement contract by reason only of not being actively at work on the effective date of the replacement contract,


and, despite subsection (1), if the replacement contract provides that insurance money or other benefits to be paid or provided under subsection (1) by the insurer of the other contract are to be paid instead under the replacement contract, the insurer of the other contract is not liable to pay that insurance money or provide those benefits.








Designation of beneficiary





59



(1)


Subject to subsection (4), an insured may in a contract or by a declaration designate the insured, the insured's personal representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for whose benefit insurance money is to be payable.






(2)


Subject to section 60, the insured may alter or revoke the designation by a declaration.






(3)


A designation in favour of the "heirs", "next of kin" or "estate" of an insured, or the use of words having similar meaning in a designation, is deemed to be a designation of the personal representative of the insured.






(4)


Subject to the regulations, an insurer may restrict or exclude in a contract the right of an insured to designate persons to whom or for whose benefit insurance money is to be payable.






(5)


A contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group insurance on some or all of the group life insureds under the replaced contract may provide that a designation applicable to the replaced contract of a group life insured, a group life insured's personal representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for whose benefit insurance money is to be payable is deemed to apply to the replacing contract.






(6)


If a contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group insurance provides that a designation referred to in subsection (5) is deemed to apply to the replacing contract,






(a)


each certificate in respect of the replacing contract must indicate that the designation under the replaced contract has been carried forward and that the group life insured should review the existing designation to ensure it reflects the group life insured's current intentions, and






(b)


as between the insurer under the replacing contract and a claimant under that contract, that insurer is liable to the claimant for any errors or omissions by the previous insurer in respect of the recording of the designation carried forward under the replacing contract.






(7)


If a beneficiary becomes entitled to insurance money and all or part of the insurance money remains with the insurer under a settlement option provided for in the contract or permitted by the insurer, that portion of the insurance money remaining with the insurer is deemed to be insurance money held under a contract on the life of the beneficiary, and, subject to the provisions of the settlement option, the beneficiary has the rights and interests of an insured with respect to the insurance money.








Irrevocable designation of beneficiary





60



(1)


An insured may in a contract or by a declaration, other than a declaration that is part of a will, filed with the insurer at its head or principal office in Canada during the lifetime of the person whose life is insured, designate a beneficiary irrevocably, and in that event the insured, while the beneficiary is living, may not alter or revoke the designation without the consent of the beneficiary, and the insurance money is not subject to the control of the insured or the claims of the insured's creditors and does not form part of the insured's estate.






(2)


If the insured purports to designate a beneficiary irrevocably in a will or in a declaration that is not filed as provided in subsection (1), the designation has the same effect as if the insured had not purported to make it irrevocable.








Designation in will





61



(1)


A designation in an instrument purporting to be a will is not ineffective by reason only of the fact that the instrument is invalid as a will, or that the designation is invalid as a bequest under the will.






(2)


Despite the


Wills, Estates and Succession Act


, a designation in a will is of no effect against a designation made later than the making of the will.






(3)


If a designation is contained in a will and subsequently the will is revoked by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.






(4)


If a designation is contained in an instrument that purports to be a will and the instrument, if it were valid as a will, would be revoked by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.








Trustee for beneficiary





62



(1)


An insured may in a contract or by a declaration appoint a trustee for a beneficiary and may alter or revoke the appointment by a declaration.

(a)


to the surviving beneficiary,






(b)


if there is more than one surviving beneficiary, to the surviving beneficiaries in equal shares, or






(c)


if there is no surviving beneficiary, to the insured or the insured's personal representative.






(2)


If 2 or more beneficiaries are designated otherwise than alternatively, but no division of the insurance money is made, the insurance money is payable to them in equal shares.






(3)


A beneficiary may disclaim the beneficiary's right to insurance money by filing notice in writing with the insurer at its head or principal office in Canada.






(4)


A notice of disclaimer filed under subsection (3) is irrevocable.






(5)


Subsection (1) applies in the case of a disclaiming beneficiary or in the case of a beneficiary determined by a court to be disentitled to insurance money as if the disclaiming or disentitled beneficiary predeceased the person whose life is insured.








Enforcement of payment by beneficiary or trustee





64



A beneficiary may enforce in the beneficiary's own name and for the beneficiary's own benefit, and a trustee appointed under section 62 may enforce as trustee, the payment of insurance money made payable to the beneficiary or trustee in the contract or by a declaration and in accordance with the provisions of it, but the insurer may set up any defence that it could have set up against the insured or the insured's personal representative.








Insurance money exempt from seizure





65



(1)


If a beneficiary is designated, the insurance money, from the time of the happening of the event on which the insurance money becomes payable, is not part of the estate of the insured and is not subject to the claims of the creditors of the insured.






(2)


While there is in effect a designation in favour of any one or more of a spouse, child, grandchild or parent of a person whose life is insured, the insurance money and the rights and interests of the insured in the insurance money and in the contract are exempt from execution or seizure.








Assignment of insurance





66



(1)


If a beneficiary






(a)


is not designated irrevocably, or






(b)


is designated irrevocably but has attained the age of 19 years and consents,


the insured may assign, exercise rights under or in respect of, surrender or otherwise deal with the contract as provided in it or in this Part, or as may be agreed on with the insurer.






(2)


Despite section 60 (1), if a beneficiary is designated irrevocably and has not consented as described in subsection (l) (b) of this section, the insured may exercise any rights in respect of the contract that are prescribed by regulation.






(3)


Subject to the terms of a consent under subsection (l) (b) or a court order under subsection (4), if there is an irrevocable designation of a beneficiary under a contract, a person acquiring an interest in the contract takes that interest subject to the rights of that beneficiary.






(4)


When a beneficiary who is designated irrevocably is unable to provide consent under subsection (1) (b) because of legal incapacity, an insured may apply to the court for an order permitting the insured to deal with the contract without that consent.






(5)


The court may grant an order under subsection (4) on any notice and terms it considers just.








Entitlement to dividends





67



(1)


Despite the irrevocable designation of a beneficiary, the insured is entitled before the insured's death to the dividends or bonuses declared on a contract, unless the contract provides otherwise.






(2)


Unless the insured directs otherwise, the insurer may apply the dividends or bonuses declared on the contract for the purpose of keeping the contract in force.








Transfer of insured's rights





68

Despite the


Wills, Estates and Succession Act


, if, in a contract or declaration, it is provided that a person named in the contract or declaration has, on the death of the insured, the rights and interests of the insured in the contract,






(a)


the rights and interests of the insured in the contract do not, on the death of the insured, form part of the insured's estate, and






(b)


on the death of the insured, the person named in the contract or declaration has the rights and interests given to the insured by the contract and by this Part and is deemed to be the insured.






(2)


If the contract or declaration provides that 2 or more persons named in the contract or in the declaration, on the death of the insured, have successively on the death of each of them the rights and interests of the insured in the contract, this section applies successively, so far as applicable and with the necessary changes, to each of those persons and their rights and interests in the contract.






(3)


Despite a nomination made under this section, the insured may, before the insured's death,






(a)


assign, exercise rights under or in respect of, surrender or otherwise deal with the contract as if the nomination had not been made, and






(b)


subject to the terms of the contract, alter or revoke the nomination by declaration.








Effect of assignment





69



(1)


If an assignee of a contract gives notice in writing of the assignment to the insurer at its head or principal office in Canada, the assignee has priority of interest as against






(a)


an assignee other than one who gave notice earlier to the insurer of an assignment in the manner provided for in this subsection, and






(b)


a beneficiary other than one designated irrevocably as provided for in section 60 before the assignee gave notice to the insurer of the assignment in the manner provided for in this subsection.






(2)


If a contract is assigned as security, the rights of a beneficiary under the contract are affected only to the extent necessary to give effect to the rights and interests of the assignee.






(3)


If a contract is assigned unconditionally and otherwise than as security, the assignee has all the rights and interests given to the insured by the contract and by this Part and is deemed to be the insured.






(4)


Unless the document by which a contract is assigned specifies otherwise, an assignment described in subsection (3) made on or after the date this section comes into force revokes






(a)


a designation of a beneficiary made before or after that date and not made irrevocably, and






(b)


a nomination referred to in section 68 (1) made before or after that date.






(5)


A contract may provide that the rights or interests of the insured or, in the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, of the group life insured or debtor insured, as applicable, are not assignable.








Group life insured may enforce rights

(a)


in the case of the debtor insured, in the debtor insured's own name, or

the creditor's rights in respect of a claim arising in relation to that debtor insured, subject to any defence available to the insurer against the creditor or that debtor insured.

Changes in occupation







3.


(1)


If after this policy is issued the person insured engages for compensation in an occupation that is classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in the contract, the liability under the contract is limited to the amount that the premium paid would have purchased for the more hazardous occupation according to the limits, classification of risks, and premium rates in use by the insurer at the time the person insured engaged in the more hazardous occupation.

(a)


reduce the premium rate, or










(b)


issue a policy for the unexpired term of the contract at the lower rate of premium applicable to the less hazardous occupation,










according to the limits, classification of risks, and premium rates used by the insurer at the date of receipt of advice of the change in occupation, and must refund to the insured the amount by which the unearned premium on the contract exceeds the premium at the lower rate for the unexpired term.

(a)


the notice or proof is given or furnished as soon as reasonably possible, and in no event later than one year after the date of the accident or the date a claim arises under the contract on account of sickness or disability, and it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to give the notice or furnish the proof in the time required by this condition, or










(b)


in the case of the death of the person insured, if a declaration of presumption of death is necessary, the notice or proof is given or furnished no later than one year after the date a court makes the declaration.







Insurer to furnish forms for proof of claim







6.


The insurer must furnish forms for proof of claim within 15 days after receiving notice of claim, but if the claimant has not received the forms within that time the claimant may submit a proof of claim in the form of a written statement of the cause or nature of the accident, sickness or disability giving rise to the claim and of the extent of the loss.

Omission or variation of statutory conditions





102



(1)


If a statutory condition is not applicable to the benefits provided by the contract, it may be omitted from the policy or varied so that it will be applicable.

(4)


Statutory Conditions 3, 4 and 7, and, subject to the restriction in subsection (5), Statutory Condition 5 may be varied; but if by reason of the variation the contract is less favourable to the insured, a person insured, or a beneficiary than it would be if the condition had not been varied, the condition is deemed to be included in the policy in the form in which it appears in section 101.






(5)


Statutory Condition 5 (1) (a) and (b) may not be varied in policies providing benefits for loss of time.

Sufficiency of proof and role of court





105



Sections 78 to 81 of Part 3 apply with the necessary changes in the case of insurance money payable under this Part in the event of a person's death and, for that purpose, a reference in those sections to section 73 must be read as a reference to Statutory Condition 5 (1) set out in section 101.








Termination for non-payment





106



(1)


If a policy evidencing a contract or a certificate evidencing the renewal of a contract is delivered to the insured and the initial premium due under the contract or renewal has not been fully paid,






(a)


the contract or the renewal of it evidenced by the policy or certificate is as binding on the insurer as if the premium had been paid even if the policy or certificate was delivered by an officer or an agent of the insurer who did not have authority to deliver it, and






(b)


the contract may be terminated for non-payment of the premium by the insurer giving






(i)


15 days' notice of termination by registered mail, or

the period of grace within which the premium may be paid, if any, specified in the contract,


whichever is the longer period.






(4)

(a)


if it is a contract of group insurance, or






(b)


if the person insured has consented in writing to the insurance.






(3)


If the person insured is under the age of 16 years, consent to the insurance may be given by one of the person insured's parents or by a person standing in the place of a parent.

(ii)

Termination of contract by court





109

If






(a)


a person whose life or well being or both are insured under a contract is someone other than the insured, and






(b)


the person reasonably believes that their life or health might be endangered by the insurance on their life or well being or both continuing under that contract,


on the application of that person, the court may make the orders the court considers just in the circumstances.

(4)


Despite subsection (3), if the court considers it just to do so, the court may dispense with the notice in the case of a person other than






(a)


the insurer, or






(b)


if the contract is a contract of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, the insured.






(5)

(a)


to make an enforceable contract, and






(b)


in respect of a contract.








Duty to disclose





111



(1)


An applicant for insurance and a person to be insured must each disclose to the insurer in the application, on a medical examination, if any, and in any written statements or answers furnished as evidence of insurability, every fact within the applicant's or person's knowledge that is material to the insurance and is not so disclosed by the other.






(2)


Subject to sections 112 and 115 and subsection (3) of this section, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact referred to in subsection (1) renders the contract voidable by the insurer.






(3)


A failure to disclose or misrepresentation referred to in subsection (1) relating to evidence of insurability with respect to an application for






(a)


additional coverage under a contract,






(b)


an increase in insurance under a contract, or






(c)


any other change to insurance after the policy is issued


renders the contract voidable by the insurer but only in relation to the addition, increase or change.








Failure to disclose





112



(1)


Subject to section 115 and subsections (2) to (4) of this section, if a contract, including renewals of it, or an addition, increase or change referred to in section 111 (3), has been in effect for 2 years with respect to a person insured, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact required by section 111 to be disclosed in respect of that person insured does not, in the absence of fraud, render the contract voidable.






(2)


In the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact required by section 111 to be disclosed in respect of a group person insured, a person insured or a debtor insured does not render the contract voidable, but






(a)


if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of application for the insurance in respect of the person, the insurance in respect of that person is voidable by the insurer, and






(b)


if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of application for an addition, increase or change referred to in section 111 (3) in respect of the person, the addition, increase or change in respect of that person is voidable by the insurer,


unless the insurance, addition, increase or change has been in effect for 2 years during the lifetime of that person, in which case the insurance, addition, increase or change is not, in the absence of fraud, voidable.






(3)


If a claim arises from a loss incurred or a disability beginning before a contract, including renewals of it, has been in effect for 2 years with respect to the person in respect of whom the claim is made, subsection (1) does not apply to that claim.






(4)


If a claim arises from a loss incurred or a disability beginning before the addition, increase or change has been in effect for 2 years with respect to the person in respect of whom the claim is made, subsection (1) does not apply to that claim.








Failure to disclose on reinstatement





113



Sections 111 and 112 apply, as far as applicable and with the necessary changes, to a failure at the time of reinstatement of a contract to disclose or a misrepresentation at that time, and the period of 2 years to which reference is made in section 112 begins to run in respect of a reinstatement from the date of reinstatement.








Pre-existing conditions





114



If a contract contains a general exception or reduction with respect to pre-existing disease or physical conditions and the person insured, group person insured or debtor insured suffers or has suffered from a disease or physical condition that existed before the date the contract came into force with respect to that person and the disease or physical condition is not by name or specific description excluded from the insurance respecting that person,






(a)


the prior existence of the disease or physical condition is not, except in the case of fraud, available as a defence against liability in whole or in part for a loss incurred or a disability beginning after the contract, including renewals of it, has been in effect continuously for 2 years immediately before the date of loss incurred or commencement of disability with respect to that person, and






(b)


the prior existence of the disease or physical condition is not, except in the case of fraud, available as a defence against liability in whole or in part if the disease or physical condition was disclosed in the application for the contract.








Misstatement of age





115



(1)


Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if the age of the person insured has been misstated to the insurer, then, at the option of the insurer, either






(a)


the benefits payable under the contract may be increased or decreased to the amount that would have been provided for the same premium at the correct age, or






(b)


the premium may be adjusted in accordance with the correct age as of the date the person insured became insured.






(2)


In the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, if there is a misstatement to the insurer of the age of a group person insured, person insured or debtor insured, the provisions, if any, of the contract with respect to age or misstatement of age apply.






(3)


If the age of a person affects the commencement or termination of the insurance, the correct age governs.








Termination and replacement of group policies





116



(1)


If a contract of group insurance or a benefit provision in a contract of group insurance is terminated, the insurer continues, as though the contract or benefit provision had remained in full force and effect, to be liable to pay to or in respect of a group person insured under the contract benefits relating to






(a)


loss of income because of disability,






(b)


death,






(c)


dismemberment, or






(d)


accidental damage to natural teeth,


arising from an accident or sickness that occurred before the termination of the contract or benefit provision, if the disability, death, dismemberment or accidental damage to natural teeth is reported to the insurer within the 6 month period following the termination or a longer continuous period specified in the contract.






(2)


Despite subsection (1), an insurer does not remain liable under a contract or benefit provision described in that subsection to pay a benefit for loss of income for the recurrence of a disability after both of the following occur:






(a)


the termination of the contract or benefit provision;






(b)


a continuous period of 6 months, or any longer period provided in the contract, during which the group person insured was not disabled.






(3)


An insurer that is liable under subsection (1) to pay a benefit for loss of income as a result of the disability of a group person insured is not liable to pay the benefit for any period longer than the portion remaining, at the date the disability began, of the maximum period provided under the contract for the payment of a benefit for loss of income in respect of a disability of the group person insured.






(4)


If a contract of group insurance, in this subsection called the "replacement contract", is entered into within 31 days after the termination of another contract of group insurance, in this subsection called the "other contract", and that replacement contract insures some or all of the same group person insureds as the other contract,






(a)


the replacement contract is deemed to provide that any person who was insured under the other contract at the time of its termination is insured under the replacement contract from and after the termination of the other contract if






(i)


the insurance on that person under the other contract terminated by reason only of the termination of the other contract, and






(ii)


the person is a member of a class eligible for insurance under the replacement contract,






(b)


every person who was insured under the other contract and who is insured under the replacement contract is entitled to receive credit for any deductible earned before the effective date of the replacement contract, and






(c)


no person who was insured under the other contract at the time of its termination may be excluded from eligibility under the replacement contract by reason only of not being actively at work on the effective date of the replacement contract,


and, despite subsection (1), if the replacement contract provides that all benefits required to be paid under subsection (1) by the insurer of the other contract are to be paid instead under the replacement contract, the insurer of the other contract is not liable to pay those benefits.








Designation of beneficiary





117



(1)


Subject to subsection (4), an insured may in a contract or by a declaration designate the insured, the insured's personal representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for whose benefit insurance money is to be payable.






(2)


Subject to section 118, an insured may by declaration alter or revoke a designation referred to in subsection (1).






(3)


A designation in favour of the "heirs", "next of kin" or "estate" of an insured, or the use of words having a similar meaning in a designation, is deemed to be a designation of the personal representative of the insured.






(4)


Subject to the regulations, an insurer may restrict or exclude in a contract the right of an insured to designate persons to whom or for whose benefit insurance money is to be payable.






(5)


A contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group insurance on some or all of the group person insureds under the replaced contract may provide that a designation applicable to the replaced contract of a group person insured, a group person insured's personal representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for whose benefit insurance money is to be payable is deemed to apply to the replacing contract.






(6)


If a contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group insurance provides that a designation referred to in subsection (5) is deemed to apply to the replacing contract,






(a)


each certificate in respect of the replacing contract must indicate that the designation under the replaced contract has been carried forward and that the group person insured should review the existing designation to ensure it reflects the group person insured's current intentions, and






(b)


as between the insurer under the replacing contract and a claimant under that contract, that insurer is liable to the claimant for any errors or omissions by the previous insurer in respect of the recording of the designation carried forward under the replacing contract.






(7)


If a beneficiary becomes entitled to insurance money and all or part of the insurance money remains with the insurer under a settlement option provided for in the contract or permitted by the insurer, that portion of the insurance money remaining with the insurer is deemed to be insurance money held under a contract of life insurance on the life of the beneficiary, and, subject to the provisions of the settlement option, the beneficiary has the same rights and interests with respect to the insurance money that an insured has under a contract of life insurance.








Irrevocable designation of beneficiary





118



(1)


An insured may in a contract or by a declaration, other than a declaration that is part of a will, filed with the insurer at its head or principal office in Canada during the lifetime of the person whose life or well being or both are insured, designate a beneficiary irrevocably, and in that event the insured, while the beneficiary is living, may not alter or revoke the designation without the consent of the beneficiary, and the insurance money is not subject to the control of the insured or the claims of the insured's creditors and does not form part of the insured's estate.






(2)


If an insured purports to designate a beneficiary irrevocably in a will, or in a declaration that is not filed with the insurer, the designation has the same effect as if the insured had not purported to make it irrevocable.








Designation in will





119



(1)


A designation in an instrument purporting to be a will is not ineffective by reason only of the fact that the instrument is invalid as a will or the designation is invalid as a bequest under the will.






(2)


Despite the


Wills, Estates and Succession Act


, a designation in a will is of no effect against a designation made later than the making of the will.






(3)


If a designation is contained in a will and subsequently the will is revoked by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.






(4)


If a designation is contained in an instrument that purports to be a will and the instrument, if it were valid as a will, would be revoked by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.








Trustee for beneficiary





120



(1)


An insured may in a contract or by a declaration appoint a trustee for a beneficiary, and may alter or revoke the appointment by a declaration.

to the surviving beneficiary,






(b)


if there is more than one surviving beneficiary, to the surviving beneficiaries in equal shares, or

(5)


The court may grant an order under subsection (4) on any notice and terms it considers just.








Entitlement to dividends





126



(1)

Transfer of insured's rights





127



(1)


Despite the


Wills, Estates and Succession Act


, if, in a contract or declaration, it is provided that a person named in the contract or declaration has, on the death of the insured, the rights and interests of the insured in the contract,






(a)


the rights and interests of the insured in the contract do not, on the death of the insured, form part of the insured's estate, and

the insurance money has become unclaimed property under the


Unclaimed Property Act

Payments not exceeding $10 000





134



Even though insurance money is payable to a person, the insurer may, if the contract provides, but subject always to the rights of an assignee, pay an amount not exceeding $10 000 to

(b)


a person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled to the insurance money by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attendance or burial of a person insured or the group person insured, or to have a claim against the estate of a person insured or the group person insured in relation to such an expense,
