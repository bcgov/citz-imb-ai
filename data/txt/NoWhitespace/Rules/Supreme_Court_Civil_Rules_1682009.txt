Appendix b — party and party costs [am. b.c. reg. 277/2023, sch. 1, s. 6.] Interpretation
1 In this appendix, "process" Means the drawing, filing or service of a document and any amendment To it or particulars of it, but does not include an application made With respect to the process or any part of the process.
Scale of costs 2 (1) If a court has made an order for costs, it may fix the scale, from Scale a to scale c in subsection (2), under which the costs will be Assessed, and may order that one or more steps in the proceeding be Assessed under a different scale from that fixed for other steps.
(2) In fixing the scale of costs, the court must have regard to the Following principles:
(a) Scale a is for matters of little or less than ordinary difficulty; (b) Scale b is for matters of ordinary difficulty; (c) Scale c is for matters of more than ordinary difficulty.
(3) In fixing the appropriate scale under which costs will be assessed, The court may take into account the following:
(a) Whether a difficult issue of law, fact or construction is involved; (b) Whether an issue is of importance to a class or body of persons, or is Of general interest; (c) Whether the result of the proceeding effectively determines the rights And obligations as between the parties beyond the relief that was Actually granted or denied.
(4) If, after december 31, 2006, a settlement is reached under which Payment of assessed costs is agreed to or an order for costs is made, And if no scale is fixed or agreed to in that settlement or order, the Costs must be assessed under scale b, unless a party, on application, Obtains an order of the court that the costs be assessed under another Scale.
(5) If, after it fixes the scale of costs applicable to a proceeding under Subsection (1) or (4), the court finds that, as a result of unusual Circumstances, an award of costs on that scale would be grossly Inadequate or unjust, the court may order that the value for each unit Allowed for that proceeding, or for any step in that proceeding, be 1.5 times the value that would otherwise apply to a unit in that scale Under section 3 (1).
(6) For the purposes of subsection (5) of this section, an award of costs Is not grossly inadequate or unjust merely because there is a Difference between the actual legal expenses of a party and the costs To which that party would be entitled under the scale of costs fixed Under subsection (1) or (4).
(7) If costs may be assessed without order or agreement, the scale of Costs must be fixed by the registrar on the assessment.
(8) If an offer to settle is made under rule 9-1, any costs payable on Acceptance of that offer must be assessed under scale b.
Value of units 3 (1) The value for each unit allowed on an assessment conducted after December 31, 2006 in relation to orders and settlements made after That date is as follows:
(a) Scale a — $60; (b) Scale b — $110; (c) Scale c — $170.
(2) If maximum and minimum numbers of units are provided for in an item in The tariff, the registrar has the discretion to allow a number within That range of units.
(3) If the tariff indicates a range of units for a tariff item, the Registrar must have regard to the following principles:
(a) One unit is for matters on which little time should ordinarily have Been spent; (b) The maximum number of units is for matters on which a great deal of Time should ordinarily have been spent.
Daily rates 4 (1) If, in a tariff item, a number of units is allowed for each day but The time spent during a day is not more than 2 1/2 hours, Only 1/2 of the number of units is to be allowed for that day.
(2) If, in a tariff item, a number of units is allowed for each day but The time spent during a day is more than 5 hours, the number of Units allowed for that day is to be increased by 1/2 of the number.
(3) If, in a tariff item, a number of units is allowed for preparation for An attendance but the time spent on the attendance is not more than 2 1/2 hours, only 1/2 of the number of units for preparation Is to be allowed.
(4) If, in the tariff, units may be allowed for preparation for an Activity, the registrar may allow units for preparation for an Activity that does not take place or is adjourned up to the maximum Allowable for one day.
Uncontested foreclosure proceedings 5 In a proceeding under rule 21-7, uncontested at the hearing on any Issue except costs, the costs must be assessed under scale a.
Default judgment and process for execution 6 (1) Schedule 1 applies to the costs that may be assessed on a default Judgment entered under rule 3-8.
(2) The amount involved under subsection (1) is the amount for which the Judgment is entered.
(3) If a writ of execution or garnishing order, or a process in form 56, 58 or 59, is issued, the costs must be endorsed on the process and Allowed in accordance with schedule 2, instead of item 42.
(4) The amount involved under subsection (3) is the amount payable, if Any, that is endorsed on the process.
(5) In addition to the fees set out in schedules 1 and 2, the costs of any Application to the court relating to the judgment or to the process For execution may be ordered to be assessed under the tariff.
Apportionment if proceedings tried together 7 If 2 or more proceedings have, by order, been tried at the same time Or tried one after the other and no order has been made as to Apportionment of costs, the registrar may (a) Assess 2 or more bills as one bill, (b) Allow an item once or more than once, or (c) Apportion the costs of an item or of the whole bill between the Proceedings.
