Scale of costs 2 (1) If a court has made an order for costs, it may fix the scale, from Scale a to scale c in subsection (2), under which the costs will be Assessed, and may order that one or more steps in the proceeding be Assessed under a different scale from that fixed for other steps.
(2) In fixing the scale of costs, the court must have regard to the Following principles:
(a) Scale a is for matters of little or less than ordinary difficulty; (b) Scale b is for matters of ordinary difficulty; (c) Scale c is for matters of more than ordinary difficulty.
(3) In fixing the appropriate scale under which costs will be assessed, The court may take into account the following:
(a) Whether a difficult issue of law, fact or construction is involved; (b) Whether an issue is of importance to a class or body of persons, or is Of general interest; (c) Whether the result of the proceeding effectively determines the rights And obligations as between the parties beyond the relief that was Actually granted or denied.

(5) If, after it fixes the scale of costs applicable to a proceeding under Subsection (1) or (4), the court finds that, as a result of unusual Circumstances, an award of costs on that scale would be grossly Inadequate or unjust, the court may order that the value for each unit Allowed for that proceeding, or for any step in that proceeding, be 1.5 times the value that would otherwise apply to a unit in that scale Under section 3 (1).
(6) For the purposes of subsection (5) of this section, an award of costs Is not grossly inadequate or unjust merely because there is a Difference between the actual legal expenses of a party and the costs To which that party would be entitled under the scale of costs fixed Under subsection (1) or (4).

(a) One unit is for matters on which little time should ordinarily have Been spent; (b) The maximum number of units is for matters on which a great deal of Time should ordinarily have been spent.
Daily rates 4 (1) If, in a tariff item, a number of units is allowed for each day but The time spent during a day is not more than 2 1/2 hours, Only 1/2 of the number of units is to be allowed for that day.
