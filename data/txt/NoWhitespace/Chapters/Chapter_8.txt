Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this schedule, in each year the nisg̱a'a Fish allocation of each species of nass salmon is:
A. the percentage for that species set out in table 1, row 1, multiplied By
B. the estimated number of that species returning to canada in that Year, and C. if a portion of the return to canadian waters of chinook, coho, or Chum salmon can be identified as resulting from nisg̱a'a enhancement Initiatives in the nass area approved under paragraph 34 of the Fisheries chapter, that portion will be subtracted from the estimated Number of nass salmon of that species returning to canadian waters in That year.
2.
If the minister has established a minimum escapement level for a species Under paragraph 11 of the fisheries chapter, and the number of nass Salmon of that species returning to canada exceeds the minimum Escapement level but does not exceed the small return to canada for that Species set out in table 1, row 2, the nisg̱a'a fish allocation will Increase in a linear manner, from zero at the minimum escapement level To the threshold for that species set out in table 1, row 3, except that The nisg̱a'a fish allocation will not exceed the return to canada minus The minimum escapement level.
3.
If the number of nass salmon of a species returning to canada exceeds The large return to canada for that species set out in table 1, row 2, The nisg̱a'a fish allocation will not exceed the maximum for that species Set out in table 1, row 3.
4.
If, in any year, a portion of the return of chinook, coho, or chum Salmon is identified as resulting from nisg̱a'a enhancement initiatives In the nass area, as described in subparagraph 1 (c) of this schedule, The nisg̱a'a fish allocations of these fish are as set out in paragraph 35 of the fisheries chapter.

For the purpose of catch accounting, harvests for each salmon species Are classified into two groups of fisheries:
A. nisg̱a'a fisheries; and B. other canadian fisheries harvesting nass salmon.
2.
To determine the overage or underage for a nass salmon species in Nisg̱a'a fisheries, the following post-season estimates are required for Each species of salmon:
A. the total return to canada (the "trtc") for that species of nass Salmon;
B. the total escapement to nass area streams (the "post-season Escapement estimate"); C. the harvest share for nisg̱a'a fisheries (the "nisg̱a'a share") for That year determined in accordance with the nisg̱a'a fish allocations set Out in the fisheries chapter and the harvest agreement using the Post-season estimate of the trtc and the escapement goal for that year, Including any adjustments to the nisg̱a'a share for overages and Underages;
D. the harvest allowed for other canadian fisheries (the "remaining Allowable catch") based on the post-season estimate of trtc, the Escapement goal and the nisg̱a'a share for that year; E. the total number of fish of that species caught in nisg̱a'a fisheries (the "nisg̱a'a catch"); F. the total number of nass salmon of that species caught in other Canadian fisheries (the "other catch"); and G. the total catch for a year (the "total catch") determined by adding The nisg̱a'a catch to the other catch.
3.
In each year, the nisg̱a'a account will be calculated for each species, As set out below, to determine if an overage or underage has occurred For that species. if the nisg̱a'a account is a number greater than zero, Then there is an overage. if the nisg̱a'a account is a number less than Zero, then there is an underage.
4.
The nisg̱a'a account for salmon in each year will be calculated as Follows:
A. if the post-season escapement estimate is greater than or equal to The escapement goal and the minister has provided reasonable Opportunities for the harvest of the nisg̱a'a fish allocations and the Nisg̱a'a catch is less than the nisg̱a'a share, and the other catch is Less than or equal to the remaining allowable catch, the nisg̱a'a account Is zero; B. if the post-season escapement estimate is greater than or equal to The escapement goal and the nisg̱a'a catch is more than the nisg̱a'a Share, the nisg̱a'a account is:
Nisg̱a'a account = nisg̱a'a catch − nisg̱a'a share ; C. if the post-season escapement estimate is greater than or equal to The escapement goal and the other canadian fisheries harvest more than Their share, the nisg̱a'a account is:
Nisg̱a'a account = remaining allowable catch − other catch ; D. if the post-season escapement estimate is less than or equal to the Escapement goal and there is a nisg̱a'a share and there is no remaining Allowable catch, the nisg̱a'a account is:
Nisg̱a'a account = nisg̱a'a catch − nisg̱a'a share − other catch ; E. if the post-season escapement estimate is less than the escapement Goal and there is a nisg̱a'a share and there is a remaining allowable Catch, the nisg̱a'a account for sockeye salmon is:
Nisg̱a'a account = nisg̱a'a catch − nisg̱a'a share − 13% of the Overharvest
; And the nisg̱a'a account for pink salmon is:
Nisg̱a'a account = nisg̱a'a catch − nisg̱a'a share − 15% of the Overharvest
; And the nisg̱a'a account for each of the other salmon species is:
Nisg̱a'a account = nisg̱a'a catch − Nisg̱a'a share • total catch ( Nisg̱a'a share + remaining allowable catch ) 5.
In each year, the "cumulative nisg̱a'a account" for each species will be Calculated by adding that year's nisg̱a'a account for that species, to The previous year's cumulative nisg̱a'a account for that species as Adjusted under paragraph 6 of this schedule or paragraph 30 of the Fisheries chapter.
Adjustment of the nisg̱a'a harvest 6.
The minister and nisg̱a'a lisims government will endeavour to minimize Any overages or underages in each year and to minimize the accumulation Of overages and underages in successive years, but in any year:
A. unless otherwise agreed by the minister and nisg̱a'a lisims Government, any adjustments to the nisg̱a'a harvest in that year for past Overages will not exceed 5% of the total nisg̱a'a fish allocations of That species; B. any adjustments to the nisg̱a'a harvest in that year for past Underages will only be made if those adjustments:
I. are approved by nisg̱a'a lisims government, and Ii. unless otherwise agreed by the minister and nisg̱a'a lisims Government, do not exceed 5% of the pre-season estimate of the remaining Allowable catch for that species; C. the minister and nisg̱a'a lisims government may agree to reduce an Overage for one species by an underage for another species, in Accordance with the system of equivalencies set out in schedule c, in Order to reduce the overages and underages in the cumulative nisg̱a'a Account; and D. if an adjustment is made to the nisg̱a'a harvest under subparagraphs (a), (b), or (c) or paragraph 30 of the fisheries chapter, a Corresponding adjustment will be made to the cumulative nisg̱a'a account.
Joint fisheries management committee recommendations 7.
The joint fisheries management committee will recommend to the minister And nisg̱a'a lisims government adjustments to the nisg̱a'a harvest in Nisg̱a'a fisheries for each year to account for cumulative overages and Cumulative underages in accordance with this schedule.
Schedule c — system of salmon equivalencies 1.
Equivalencies for conversions among salmon species will be expressed as Sockeye equivalents, where the value of each species is calculated Relative to the value of sockeye salmon. sockeye equivalents will be Based on average weights and average commercial landed value statistics For salmon in the nass area, unless otherwise agreed by the minister and Nisg̱a'a lisims government.
2.
The sockeye equivalent factor for each salmon species will be calculated As follows:
Se
Chinook
= Chinook average weight • Chinook average price/weight Sockeye average weight Sockeye average price/weight Se
Coho
= Coho average weight • Coho average price/weight Sockeye average weight Sockeye average price/weight Se
Pink
= Pink average weight • Pink average price/weight Sockeye average weight Sockeye average price/weight Se
Chum
= Chum average weight • Chum average price/weight Sockeye average weight Sockeye average price/weight Schedule d — determination of the nisg̱a'a fish allocation of steelhead 1.
In this schedule, the adjusted total allowable catch of summer-run nass Steelhead is equal to 95% of the total number of the summer-run nass Steelhead returning to the nass area less the annual escapement goal.
2.
The nisg̱a'a fish allocation of summer-run nass steelhead under paragraph 46 of the fisheries chapter will be equal to:
A. 5% of the total number of summer-run nass steelhead returning to the Nass area; plus B. 25% of the adjusted total allowable catch But, in any event, the nisg̱a'a fish allocation will not exceed 1000 Summer-run nass steelhead.
Schedule e — nisg̱a'a  fish allocations of non-salmon species or Aquatic plants This schedule will set out nisg̱a'a fish allocations of non-salmon Species or aquatic plants established under this chapter after the Effective date.
