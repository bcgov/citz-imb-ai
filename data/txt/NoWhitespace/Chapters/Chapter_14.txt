In this schedule
"anniversary"
means an anniversary of the effective date.
Note 1 and Note 2 to this Schedule will be deleted, and will no longer
form part of this Agreement, when this Schedule is completed in
accordance with those Notes and the effective date occurs.
Note 1 to Schedule A
The Parties will calculate on the calculation date the amounts to be
shown in the provisional schedule of capital transfer amounts in
accordance with this Note.
The Canada and British Columbia capital transfer amounts for the
effective date will sum to $22.0 million.
The Canada and British Columbia capital transfer amounts for the first
anniversary will sum to $22.0 million.
The Canada and British Columbia capital transfer amounts will sum to
$13.0 million for each of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and
seventh anniversaries.
The capital transfer amounts for the eighth to fourteenth anniversaries,
inclusive, will be calculated on the calculation date as follows:
all seven of the Canada capital transfer amounts will be equal amounts
and each will be calculated so that the net present value, calculated on
the calculation date, of all of the Canada capital transfer amounts in
the provisional schedule of capital transfer amounts, discounted back to
the beginning of the provisional schedule of capital transfer amounts,
and using the calculation rate as the discount rate, will equal
$175,554,200 multiplied by M and divided by L; and
all seven of the British Columbia capital transfer amounts will be equal
amounts and each will be calculated so that the net present value,
calculated on the calculation date, of all of the British Columbia
capital transfer amounts in the provisional schedule of capital transfer
amounts, discounted back to the beginning of the provisional schedule of
capital transfer amounts, and using the calculation rate as the discount
rate, will equal $14,445,800 multiplied by M and divided by L
where L, M, the calculation date and the calculation rate are defined in
Note 2 to this schedule.
On each scheduled date, the Canada capital transfer amount will be
approximately 92.4 per cent of the sum of the Canada capital transfer
amount and the British Columbia capital transfer amount, and the British
Columbia capital transfer amount will be approximately 7.6 per cent of
the same sum.
Note 2 to Schedule A
The Parties will calculate on the revision date the amounts to be shown
in the final version of this schedule in accordance with this Note and
will delete the word "PROVISIONAL" from the title of this schedule.
In this note
"signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement"
means signing by the Parties after the ratification by the Nisg̱a'a
Nation in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Ratification Chapter.
If, within fifteen months after the signing of the Nisg̱a'a final
agreement, the Parliament of Canada has not enacted settlement
legislation to give effect to the Nisg̱a'a final agreement, Part B of
this note will apply. Otherwise, Part A will apply. In either event, the
following will apply:
"*" means multiplied by, and "/" means divided by;
CR is the calculation rate;
L is the value of FDDIPI for the fourth quarter of 1995 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time as the value used in M is published;
M is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar quarter
for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the
calculation date;
FDDIPI is the Final Domestic Demand Implicit Price Index for Canada,
series D15613, published regularly by Statistics Canada in Matrix 6544:
Implicit Price Indexes, Gross Domestic Product;
the calculation date is a date 14 days before the signing of the Nisg̱a'a
final agreement, or another date if the Parties agree, and is the same
calculation date as that referred to in Schedule B; and
the revision date is a date 14 days before the effective date, or
another date if the Parties agree, and is the same revision date as that
referred to in Schedule B.
Part A of Note 2
On the revision date, the final schedule of capital transfer amounts
will be prepared by amending each amount in this provisional schedule as
follows:
amount in provisional schedule * (L/M) * (N/O)
where:
N is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar quarter
for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the revision
date, and
O is the value of FDDIPI for the fourth quarter of 1995 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time as the value used in N is published.
Part B of Note 2
On the revision date, the final schedule of capital transfer amounts
will be prepared by amending each amount in the provisional schedule as
follows:
amount in provisional schedule * (L/M) * (P/Q) * (1 + CR)
Y
* (1 + CR * D/365)
where:
P is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar quarter
for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the transition
date,
Q is the value of FDDIPI for the fourth quarter of 1995 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time as the value used in P is published,
Y is the number of complete years between the transition date and the
effective date,
D is the number of days remaining in the period between the transition
date and the effective date, after deducting the complete years in that
period that have been taken into account in the determination of Y,
the transition date is the date that is 15 months after the date of the
signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement, and
the calculation rate is x.xxx per cent per year.
[The rate to be inserted in the definition of calculation rate is the
most recently released rate of interest, as of the calculation date,
that the Minister of Finance for Canada has approved on loans from the
Consolidated Revenue Fund amortized over 14 years, less 0.125 per cent
(specified to three decimal places of a per cent).]
This paragraph is for information purposes and not for calculation
purposes. The approximate effects of applying Part B are to limit the
period for which the capital transfer is adjusted by FDDIPI to the
period that ends on the date that is 15 months after the signing of the
Nisg̱a'a final agreement, and to lengthen the period for which the
capital transfer is adjusted by the calculation rate to the period
between the date that is 15 months after the signing of the Nisg̱a'a
final agreement and the effective date.

In this schedule
"anniversary"
means an anniversary of the effective date.
PREPAYMENTS
In addition to any required loan repayment amount, at each anniversary,
and up to three times during the first nine months after an anniversary,
the Nisg̱a'a Nation may make loan prepayments to Canada. All prepayments
will be applied to the outstanding scheduled loan repayment amount(s) in
consecutive order from the effective date.
The "r" anniversary at which a prepayment is to be applied is the
earliest anniversary for which a scheduled loan repayment amount, or a
portion thereof, remains outstanding. Any loan prepayment applied to an
outstanding loan repayment amount, or to a portion thereof, will be
credited to the Nisg̱a'a Nation at its future value, as of the "r"
anniversary, determined in accordance with the following formula:
Future Value = Prepayment * (1 + calculation rate)
Zr
* (1 + calculation rate * E/365)
where:
"*" means multiplied by, and "/" means divided by,
Zr is the number of complete years between the date of the prepayment
and the "r" anniversary,
E is one plus the number of days between the date of the prepayment and
the "r" anniversary, once the number of complete years referred to in
"Zr" above has been deducted, and
the calculation rate is x.xxx per cent per year.
[The rate to be inserted in the definition of the calculation rate is
the most recently released rate of interest, as of the calculation date,
that the Minister of Finance for Canada has approved on loans from the
Consolidated Revenue Fund amortized over 14 years, less 0.125 per cent
(specified to three decimal places of a per cent). The calculation date
is a date 14 days before the signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement, or
another date if the Parties agree, and is the same calculation date as
that referred to in Schedule A. In this paragraph
"signing of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement"
means signing by the Parties after the ratification by the Nisg̱a'a
Nation in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Ratification Chapter. This
bracketed paragraph will be deleted on the date that Note 1 to this
schedule is deleted.]
If the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding amount of
the loan repayment amount scheduled for the "r" anniversary, the excess
will be deemed to be a prepayment made on the "r" anniversary so that
the future value of the excess will be applied as of the next "r"
anniversary in a manner analogous to that described in this paragraph.
On receipt of a loan prepayment, Canada will issue a letter to the
Nisg̱a'a Nation setting out the amount of the prepayment received and the
manner in which it will be applied in accordance with this "Prepayments"
section of this schedule.
Illustrative Example:
Hypothetical calculation rate = 10.000%
Annual equal payments of $100.00
Prepayment = $100, made in year four at day 182
Fifth anniversary payment has been previously prepaid
Amount owing at fifth anniversary = $0.00
Amount owing at sixth anniversary = $100.00
Therefore:
Zr = 1
E = 184
r = 6
Future Value of prepayment made in year four at day 182 = $100.00 *
(1+0.10000)
1
* (1 + 0.10000 * 184/365) = $115.55
Amount prepaid for sixth anniversary = $100.00
Amount in excess for sixth anniversary = $115.55 – $100.00 = $15.55
Future value of $15.55 as of the seventh anniversary = $15.55 * (1 +
0.10000)
1
* (1 + 0.10000 * 0/365) = $17.11
Amount prepaid for seventh anniversary = $17.11
The prepayment made at day 182 in year four has eliminated the loan
repayment amount for the sixth anniversary and reduced the loan
repayment amount for the seventh anniversary from $100.00 to $82.89.
Note 1 to this Schedule will be deleted, and will no longer form part of
this Agreement, when this Schedule is completed in accordance with the
Note and the effective date occurs.
Note 1 to Schedule B
Canada will calculate in accordance with this note the actual loan
repayment amounts for the eighth to 14th anniversaries inclusive to be
inserted on the revision date in the final version of this schedule. In
the final version of this schedule the loan repayment amounts for the
effective date, and for the first to seventh anniversaries inclusive,
will remain as set out in the initial version of this schedule.
The revision date is a date 14 days before the effective date, or
another date if the Parties agree, and is the same revision date as that
referred to in Schedule A.
On the revision date, Canada will calculate the amounts in the final
schedule of loan repayment amounts for the eighth to 14
th
anniversaries, inclusive. These seven amounts will be equal amounts and
each will be such that the net present value of all of the amounts in
the final schedule of loan repayment amounts, discounted back to the
effective date using the calculation rate (as described in the
"Prepayment" section of this Schedule B) as the discount rate, will
equal the loan amount.
In this schedule, the loan amount means the aggregate outstanding
balance, at the effective date, of all negotiation and support loans,
including principal and accrued interest, made by Canada to the Nisg̱a'a
Tribal Council.
Canada will calculate the loan amount, based on a document that Canada
and the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council will produce jointly before the
initialling of the Nisg̱a'a final agreement. That document will set out
the amounts of all loans from Canada to the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council,
interest accrued to date and the relevant terms and conditions of those
loans.
The document referred to in the previous paragraph will be available
from either the Nisg̱a'a Tribal Council or the Federal Treaty Negotiation
Office of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development,
upon request, as of the date of initialling of the Nisg̱a'a final
agreement, to persons eligible to be enrolled as participants under that
agreement.
For information purposes (and not for calculation purposes), the
approximate amount of outstanding loans, including principal and accrued
interest, as of the date that settlement legislation is introduced in
Parliament, will be inserted in the following blank space before that
date: ____________.
