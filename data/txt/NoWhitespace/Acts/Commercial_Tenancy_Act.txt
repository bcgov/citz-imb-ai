That if any tenant holding any land at a rack-rent, or where the rent Reserved is full three-fourths of the yearly value of the demised Premises, who is in arrear for one year's rent, deserts the demised Premises and leaves the same uncultivated or unoccupied, so as no Sufficient distress can be had to countervail the arrears of rent, it Is lawful for 2 or more justices of the peace of the county, district Or place, at the request of the landlord or the landlord's bailiff or Agent, to go on and view the same, and to affix, or cause to be Affixed on the most conspicuous part of the premises notice in writing What day (not less than 14 days thereafter) they will return to take a Second view thereof; and if on such second view the tenant, or some Person on the tenant's behalf, does not appear, and pay the rent in Arrear, or there is not sufficient distress on the premises, then the Said justices may put the landlord into the possession of the said Demised premises, and the lease thereof to such tenant, as to any Demise therein contained only, shall from thenceforth become void.
