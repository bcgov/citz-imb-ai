Foreign Money Claims Act
[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 155
Payment in foreign money equivalent
1
(1)
If, before making an order for the payment of money arising out of a
claim or loss, the court considers that the person in whose favour the
order will be made will be most truly and exactly compensated if all
or part of the money payable under the order is measured in a currency
other than the currency of Canada, the court must order that the money
payable under the order will be that amount of Canadian currency that
is necessary to purchase the equivalent amount of the other currency
at a chartered bank located in British Columbia at the close of
business on the conversion date.
(2)
The conversion date is the last day, before the day on which a payment
under the order is made by the judgment debtor to the judgment
creditor, that the bank referred to in subsection (1) quotes a
Canadian dollar equivalent to the other currency.
Interest

Interest payable under the
Court Order Interest Act
must be paid at a rate determined
(a)
under the regulations made under section 3 (a), or
(b)
in the manner provided for in subsection (2).
(2)
If
(a)
due to a change in circumstances, the court considers it is not
possible to determine a rate of interest under the regulations,

the court considers it would be unjust to any of the parties that the

no regulation has been made under section 3 (a) with respect to the

the court may set a rate that is payable, having regard to rates that
are being paid on the other currency in a country where that currency
circulates as legal tender.

under the
