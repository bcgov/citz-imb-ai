Guiding principles

This Act is to be administered and interpreted in accordance with the
following principles:
(a)
all adults are entitled to live in the manner they wish and to accept
or refuse support, assistance or protection as long as they do not
harm others and they are capable of making decisions about those
matters;
(b)
all adults should receive the most effective, but the least
restrictive and intrusive, form of support, assistance or protection
when they are unable to care for themselves or their financial
affairs;
(c)
the court should not be asked to appoint, and should not appoint,
guardians unless alternatives, such as the provision of support and
assistance, have been tried or carefully considered.
Presumption of capability
3
(1)
Until the contrary is demonstrated, every adult is presumed to be
capable of making decisions about the adult's personal care, health
care and financial affairs.
(2)
An adult's way of communicating with others is not grounds for
deciding that he or she is incapable of making decisions about
anything referred to in subsection (1).

managing the adult's financial affairs, the person may
(a)
if the person is a health care provider, request a qualified health
care provider to assess the adult's incapability, or
(b)
in any case, notify the Public Guardian and Trustee of the person's
belief, and the Public Guardian and Trustee may request a qualified
health care provider to assess the adult's incapability.

qualified health care provider determines that the adult is incapable
of managing that adult's financial affairs, the qualified health care
provider may, using the prescribed form, report the adult's
incapability to a health authority designate.
(3)
If a health authority designate receives a report under subsection (2)
of an adult's incapability, the health authority designate may issue a

receives,

the adult is incapable of making those decisions,

the adult needs, and will benefit from, the assistance and protection
of a statutory property guardian,
