forum that Canada determines is appropriate.
25. Where Canada informs the Tla'amin Nation that it considers that a

Obligation, Canada will not take any further action for this reason
aimed at changing the Tla'amin Law or other exercise of power by the
Tla'amin Government; or
b. where the arbitrator, having taken into account all relevant
considerations, including any reservations and exceptions available to
Canada, determines that the Tla'amin Law or other exercise of power by

Tribunal where a Tla'amin Law or other exercise of power by the Tla'amin
Government has given rise to an issue concerning the performance of an
International Legal Obligation of Canada and Canada's positions before
the International Tribunal will take into account the commitment of the
Parties to the integrity of this Agreement.
29. Where there is a finding of an International Tribunal of
non-performance of an International Legal Obligation of Canada
attributable to a Tla'amin Law or other exercise of power by the

Tla'amin Citizens or Tla'amin Lands.
32. For so long as the
First Nations Land Management Act
is in force, Canada will indemnify the Tla'amin Nation, and the Tla'amin

of the Parties.

any provision of this Agreement.

for the Tla'amin Nation or an Indian Reserve for the use and benefit of
the Tla'amin Nation.
OTHER ABORIGINAL PEOPLE
52. Nothing in this Agreement affects, recognizes or provides any rights
under section 35 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
for any aboriginal people other than the Tla'amin Nation.

people, other than the Tla'amin Nation, have rights under section 35 of
the
Constitution Act, 1982
that are adversely affected by a provision of this Agreement:
a. the provision will operate and have effect to the extent that it does
not adversely affect those rights; and
b. where the provision cannot operate and have effect in a way that it

claims agreement, within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, with another aboriginal people, and that treaty or land claims

this Agreement, Canada or British Columbia, or both, as the case may be,
will provide the Tla'amin Nation with additional or replacement rights
or other appropriate remedies.

and attempt to reach agreement on the provision of those additional or
replacement rights or other appropriate remedies under paragraph 54.

58. The Parties recognize and acknowledge that this Agreement provides a
foundation for an ongoing relationship amongst the Parties and commit to

paragraphs 59 to 65.
59. At least sixty days before each Periodic Review Date, each Party
will provide the other Parties with written notice if the Party wishes
to discuss a matter contemplated by paragraph 60, and if no notice is
provided by any Party, the Parties will forego engaging in a review for

Within 60 days of the end of that discussion each Party will provide the
other Parties with its written response on any matter discussed during
that Review Period.
62. The periodic review under paragraphs 58 to 65 and all discussions
and information relating to the periodic review are without prejudice to
the legal positions of the Parties, unless the Parties otherwise agree.
Nothing made or done in relation to a periodic review, including the
discussions or the responses provided by the Parties, except for any
amendments made pursuant to paragraph 64, creates any legally binding
rights or obligations.
63. Except for the Parties' commitment to meet and provide written
responses under paragraph 61, neither the periodic review process under
paragraphs 58 to 65, nor the decisions or actions of the Parties
relating in any way to the periodic review process, is:
a. subject to the Dispute Resolution Chapter; or
b. reviewable by a court or in any other forum.

66. For the purposes of federal and provincial access to information and
privacy legislation, information that the Tla'amin Nation provides to

Canada or British Columbia, the request will be evaluated as if it were
a request by a province for disclosure of that information, but Canada
and British Columbia are not required to disclose to the Tla'amin Nation
information that is only available to a particular province or
particular provinces, or that is not available to any provinces.
68. The Parties may enter into agreements in relation to any one or more
of the collection, protection, retention, use, disclosure and

69. Canada or British Columbia may provide information to the Tla'amin
Nation in confidence if the Tla'amin Nation has made a law or has
entered into an agreement with Canada or British Columbia, as the case
may be, under which the confidentiality of the information will be
protected.
70. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
a. Canada and British Columbia are not required to disclose any
information that they are required or authorized to withhold under
Federal or Provincial Law, including under sections 37 to 39 of the
Canada Evidence Act
;
b. where Federal or Provincial Law allows the disclosure of certain
information only if specified conditions for disclosure are satisfied,
Canada and British Columbia are not required to disclose that
information unless those conditions are satisfied; and

withheld under a privilege at law.
OBLIGATION TO NEGOTIATE
71. Where the Parties are obliged under this Agreement to negotiate and
attempt to reach agreement all Parties will participate in the
negotiations, unless the Parties otherwise agree.
72. Where this Agreement provides that the Parties, or any two of them,
"will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement", those negotiations will
be conducted as set out in the Dispute Resolution Chapter, but no Party
is obliged to proceed to arbitration under Stage Three unless, in a
particular case, they are required to do so under paragraph 27 of the
Dispute Resolution Chapter.
73. Where this Agreement provides that a dispute will be "finally
determined by arbitration", the dispute will be referred to arbitration

Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement delivers notice to all
Parties under Appendix X-6.

establishing any of the lands transferred as an Indian Reserve or as
"Lands reserved for the Indians" within the meaning of subsection 91
(24) of the

113. The transfer of the Former Sliammon Indian Reserves to the Tla'amin
Nation in accordance with this Agreement will not, in and of itself,
result in British Columbia being liable in respect of any Contamination

land transferred to the Tla'amin Nation in accordance with this
Agreement has not been used for a prescribed industrial or commercial
purpose or any other purpose or activity prescribed under the
Environmental Management Act
, and British Columbia is not required to prepare or provide a site
profile under the
Environmental Management Act
for those lands.
115. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Tla'amin Nation from

land registry system for Tla'amin Lands that are not registered in the
Land Title Office; or

Expropriating Authority or a Provincial Expropriating Authority; and

interest necessary for the public purpose or public work.
117. Notwithstanding subparagraph 116.d.i, the Tla'amin Nation may
expropriate for public purposes and public works a fee simple estate or
a lesser interest in a fee simple estate granted under paragraph 53
where the Tla'amin Nation provides fair compensation to the owner of the
interest and the expropriation is for the smallest interest necessary
for the public purpose or public work.
118. Subject to paragraph 119 and paragraph 10 of the Land Title
Chapter, Tla'amin Law under paragraph 116 prevails to the extent of a
Conflict with Federal or Provincial Law.
119. Notwithstanding paragraph 118, Federal or Provincial Law in respect
of the division of matrimonial real property prevails to the extent of a
Conflict with Tla'amin Law in respect of the division of matrimonial
real property made under subparagraph 116.b. For greater certainty,
Tla'amin Law that may restrict the disposition of real property to a
Tla'amin Citizen is not Tla'amin Law in respect of the division of
matrimonial real property.
120. For the purposes of subparagraph 116.b. the Tla'amin Nation may
make laws with respect to estates or interests in Tla'amin Lands that
are:
a. not recognized under Federal or Provincial Law; or
b. recognized under Federal or Provincial Law provided that they are
consistent with Federal or Provincial Law with respect to those estates
or interests.
121. For greater certainty, a Tla'amin Law under subparagraph 116.b.iv
in respect of a fee simple estate granted under paragraph 53 is not
inconsistent with common law principles.
LIMITS ON PROVINCIAL EXPROPRIATION
122. British Columbia acknowledges that it is of fundamental importance
to maintain the size and integrity of Tla'amin Lands and, therefore, as
a general principle interests in Tla'amin Lands will not be expropriated
under Provincial Law.
123. Where a Provincial Expropriating Authority has determined that it
requires an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands, the Provincial
Expropriating Authority will make reasonable efforts to acquire the
estate or interest through agreement with the Tla'amin Nation.
124. Notwithstanding paragraph 122 and 123, and paragraph 2 of the
Environmental Assessment and Environmental Protection Chapter, a
Provincial Expropriating Authority may expropriate Tla'amin Lands in
accordance with Appendix J-1 and Provincial Law and with the consent and
by the order of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.
125. Notwithstanding paragraph 122, Subsurface Resources owned by the
Tla'amin Nation on Tla'amin Lands may not be expropriated by Local
Government.
126. An expropriation of Tla'amin Lands by a Provincial Expropriating
Authority will be the most limited estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands
necessary and will be expropriated for the shortest time possible.
LIMITS ON FEDERAL EXPROPRIATION
127. Canada acknowledges that it is of fundamental importance to
maintain the size and integrity of Tla'amin Lands and, therefore, as a
general principle interests in Tla'amin Lands will not be expropriated
under Federal Law.
128. Notwithstanding paragraph 127, any interest in Tla'amin Lands may
be expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority in accordance with
Appendix J-2 and Federal Law and with the consent and by the order of
the Governor-in-Council.
129. Nothing in this Agreement affects or limits the application of the
Emergencies Act
to Tla'amin Lands and that Act will continue to apply on Tla'amin Lands.

One and Two.
44. Where Canada and the Tla'amin Nation agree to a Basic Harvest for a
Non-Allocated Species, or an arbitrator provides a decision to the
Parties under paragraph 43 in respect of the Basic Harvest for that
species, Canada and the Tla'amin Nation will seek to agree on a Tla'amin
Fish Allocation for that species.
45. The Tla'amin Fish Allocation for the Non-Allocated Species will be
an amount determined by a defined harvest quantity or quota, a formula
defining a harvest quantity or quota, or a defined harvest area within
the Tla'amin Fishing Area.
46. Where Canada and the Tla'amin Nation seek to agree on a Tla'amin
Fish Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species, Canada and the Tla'amin
Nation will provide each other with recommendations in respect of the
establishment of the Tla'amin Fish Allocation for a Non-Allocated
Species and any other material that Canada or the Tla'amin Nation
consider relevant to the recommendations.
47. Canada or the Tla'amin Nation may request the Joint Fisheries
Committee to make recommendations in respect of a Tla'amin Fish
Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species.

Fisheries Committee will take into account, in addition to those matters
identified in subparagraphs 48.a to 48.d, information on the historic
and present harvests of intertidal bivalves by Tla'amin Nation within
the Tla'amin Fishing Area for Domestic Purposes.
50. Where all the representatives of Canada and the Tla'amin Nation on
the Joint Fisheries Committee agree on recommendations of the Joint
Fisheries Committee made in accordance with paragraph 48, the Joint
Fisheries Committee will notify the Parties of the recommendations.
51. Where Canada and the Tla'amin Nation agree on the Tla'amin Fish
Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species, the agreement will be in writing
and signed by Canada and the Tla'amin Nation.
52. Where Canada and the Tla'amin Nation do not agree to a Tla'amin Fish
Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species within six months after Canada
and the Tla'amin Nation agree on, or an arbitrator provides a decision
to the Parties under paragraph 44 in respect of, the Basic Harvest for
that species, the Minister will determine the Tla'amin Fish Allocation
for the species.
53. In determining a Tla'amin Fish Allocation for a Non-Allocated

Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species provided by Canada and the
Tla'amin Nation to each other in accordance with paragraph 46; and
e. other matters that are relevant.
54. Where the Minister determines a Tla'amin Fish Allocation for a
Non-Allocated Species in accordance with paragraph 52, the Tla'amin Fish
Allocation for that species will be a formula that produces an amount
that, if it had been used for the base period, would have resulted in an
average annual harvest during the base period of 1.25 times the average
of the annual harvest of the species by the Tla'amin Nation during the
base period.
55. Where the Tla'amin Nation believes that the Tla'amin Fish Allocation
for a Non-Allocated Species that has been determined by the Minister has
significant differences from the recommendations of the Joint Fisheries
Committee or the Tla'amin Nation under paragraph 48, the Tla'amin Nation
may request the Minister to provide written reasons to the Tla'amin
Nation in respect of the basis of the determination by the Minister of
the Tla'amin Fish Allocation for that species in accordance with
paragraph 52, and the Minister will provide such reasons.
56. Where Canada and the Tla'amin Nation agree in writing to a Tla'amin
Fish Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species or a Tla'amin Fish
Allocation for a Non-Allocated Species is determined by the Minister
under paragraph 52, the Parties will amend this Agreement in accordance

REGIONAL MANAGEMENT ADVISORY PROCESS FOR ABORIGINAL FISHERIES
102. Where a regional management advisory process for aboriginal
fisheries exists or is established by Canada or British Columbia for the
coordination of fisheries for an area that includes all or a portion of
the Tla'amin Fishing Area, the Tla'amin Nation will participate in that
process.
103. Subject to paragraph 104, for the coordination of fisheries, where
a regional management advisory process for aboriginal fisheries has
functions and activities similar to those of the Joint Fisheries
Committee, and the Minister determines that a function or activity of
the Joint Fisheries Committee can be carried out more effectively by the
regional process in accordance with paragraph 107, that function or
activity will be carried out by that process.
104. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, a function or activity of
the Joint Fisheries Committee under paragraphs 32 to 34, 47 to 50, 53,
85.c, 92.g, 94.a, 95 to 97, 127, sections 8 and 17 of Schedule 1 and
section 7 of Schedule 2 will remain a function or activity of the Joint
Fisheries Committee and will not be carried out by the regional
management advisory process for aboriginal fisheries.
105. Before the Minister determines that a function or activity of the
Joint Fisheries Committee will be carried out by the regional management
advisory process for aboriginal fisheries under paragraph 107, the
Minister will provide notice to the Parties, with a copy to the Joint
Fisheries Committee, of the functions or activities of the Joint
Fisheries Committee that the Minister proposes can be carried out more
effectively by the regional process.
106. Upon the Minister providing such notice to the Parties under
paragraph105, the Joint Fisheries Committee will:
a. convene a meeting to discuss whether the functions or activities
proposed by the Minister can be carried out more effectively by the
regional management advisory process for aboriginal fisheries; and
b. provide recommendations to the Minister.
107. The Minister will review the recommendations of the Joint Fisheries
Committee made under paragraph 106 and determine any functions or
activities that will be carried out by the regional management advisory
process for aboriginal fisheries and notify the Parties in writing.
108. Upon the Minister notifying the Parties of the functions or
activities that will be carried out by the regional management advisory
process for aboriginal fisheries as determined under paragraph 107, the
Tla'amin Nation, if it believes that a function or activity of the Joint
Fisheries Committee that will be carried out by the regional process
cannot be carried out more effectively by that process, may provide
written reasons to the Minister as to why the regional process will be
less effective than the Joint Fisheries Committee carrying out the
function or activity. Upon receipt of the reasons by the Tla'amin
Nation, the Minister will respond in writing to the Tla'amin Nation.
109. Where a function or activity of the Joint Fisheries Committee will
be carried out by a regional management advisory process for aboriginal
fisheries as determined by the Minister under paragraph 107:
a. the Parties will discuss the operating procedures for participation
by the Tla'amin Nation in the regional process;
b. the Parties will revise the Tla'amin Fisheries Operational Guidelines
to reflect the change of the functions, activities and operating
procedures of the regional process; and
c. a reference in this Agreement to the Joint Fisheries Committee will
be read as a reference to the regional process for that function or
activity.
110. The Joint Fisheries Committee will continue to carry out any
function or activity that is not carried out by the regional management
advisory process for aboriginal fisheries and may discuss any changes
that should be made to the operating procedures of the Joint Fisheries
Committee as a result of the regional management advisory process for
aboriginal fisheries carrying out a function or activity of the Joint
Fisheries Committee as determined by the Minister under paragraph 107.
111. Where a regional management advisory process for aboriginal
fisheries carries out a function or activity of the Joint Fisheries
Committee and, in carrying out the function or activity, makes a
recommendation to the Minister, a Party may submit its own written
recommendation to the Minister if it does not agree with the
recommendation of the regional process and, when doing so, will provide
a copy of its own recommendations to the other Parties who have
appointed a member to the Joint Fisheries Committee. Upon receipt of the
written recommendation from one of the Joint Fisheries Committee
members, the Minister will respond in writing to the Joint Fisheries
Committee.
112. Following a determination by the Minister under paragraph 107 that
a function or activity will be carried out by the regional management
advisory process for aboriginal fisheries, the Joint Fisheries Committee
will, from time to time, discuss the effectiveness of the regional
management advisory process for aboriginal fisheries in carrying out a
function or activity of the Joint Fisheries Committee, and may provide
recommendations to the Minister that a function or activity should be
carried out by the Joint Fisheries Committee. The Minister will review
the recommendations of the Joint Fisheries Committee and determine
whether a function or activity will continue to be carried out by the
regional management advisory process for aboriginal fisheries or should
be resumed to be carried out by the Joint Fisheries Committee. The
Minister will notify the Parties in writing of any determination.
113. Following a determination by the Minister under paragraph 107 that
a function or activity of the Joint Fisheries Committee will be carried
out by a regional management advisory process for aboriginal fisheries,
the Minister may, from time to time, determine that a function carried
out by the regional process is more effectively carried out by the Joint
Fisheries Committee and should be resumed by the Joint Fisheries
Committee. Upon the Minister determining that a function or activity
should be resumed by the Joint Fisheries Committee, the Minister will
notify the Parties in writing and the Parties will update the Tla'amin
Fisheries Operational Guidelines, as required, to reflect the
resumption.
114. Canada or British Columbia may terminate a regional management
advisory process for aboriginal fisheries that has been established and,
if a regional management advisory process for aboriginal fisheries is
terminated and is not replaced by another process, the Joint Fisheries
Committee will resume carrying out its original functions or activities
and the Parties will revise the Tla'amin Fisheries Operational
Guidelines to reflect the resumption.
115. For greater certainty, a regional management advisory process for
aboriginal fisheries does not include an international advisory process.
PUBLIC FISHERIES ADVISORY PROCESS
116. Where Canada or British Columbia establishes a public fisheries
advisory process that includes all or a portion of the Tla'amin Fishing
Area, Canada or British Columbia will, if appropriate, make provisions
for Tla'amin Nation participation in that process on the same basis as
other First Nations.
117. Where the Minister intends to provide for Tla'amin Nation
participation in a public fisheries advisory process for an area that
includes all or a portion of the Tla'amin Fishing Area, the Minister
will discuss with the Tla'amin Nation their participation in the public
fisheries advisory process.
118. A public fisheries advisory process referred to in paragraph 116
does not include international fisheries advisory bodies.
119. The design, establishment and termination of public fishery
advisory processes referred to in paragraph 116 are at the discretion of
the Minister.
TLA'AMIN FISHERIES OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES
120. The Parties will jointly develop guidelines called the Tla'amin

124. The general commercial fishing licences issued under paragraph 123,
and the commercial fisheries and related activities carried out under
the authority of those licences, will be subject to Federal and
Provincial Law in respect of commercial fisheries in British Columbia.
Subject to the provisions of the
Fisheries Act
and regulations made under that act, the Minister may amend the
conditions attached to the general commercial fishing licences and may
choose not to renew those licences.
125. For greater certainty, the Minister retains the authority to manage
commercial fisheries, including whether to have commercial fisheries in
British Columbia and, if so, where and when the fisheries will occur.
HARVEST OF SURPLUS SALMON
126. Each year the Minister may determine whether there is a surplus of
a species or stock of salmon originating in the Tla'amin Fishing Area,
the size of the surplus, and access to that surplus.
127. The Joint Fisheries Committee may:
a. recommend to the Minister procedures for the identification of a
surplus and terms and conditions for the harvest of the surplus; and
b. provide advice to the Minister on the size and disposition of the
surplus.
128. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 127 limits the ability
of the Minister to declare a surplus in the absence of recommendations
from the Joint Fisheries Committee.
129. The Minister may permit the Tla'amin Nation to harvest some or all
of the surplus salmon that originate in the Tla'amin Fishing Area, on
reaching agreement with the Tla'amin Nation in respect of the terms and
conditions of that harvest.

loan repayment amount has been prepaid in accordance with paragraph 4.
PREPAYMENTS
4. In addition to any negotiation loan repayment required under

date of the prepayment and the "n" anniversary, once the number of
complete years referred to in "K" above has been deducted.
6. Where the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding
amount of the negotiation loan repayment amount scheduled for the "n"
anniversary, the excess will be deemed to be a prepayment made on the
"n" anniversary so that the future value of the excess will be applied

NOTES FOR FINALIZING SCHEDULE 1
These notes will not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these
notes is to enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the
amounts to be shown in the final version of this Schedule.
1. In these notes:
"FDDIPI"
means the Final Domestic Demand Implicit Price Index for Canada, series
D100466, published regularly by Statistics Canada in Matrix 10512:
Implicit Price Indexes, Gross Domestic Product, or its replacement
series as specified by Statistics Canada;
"Revision Date"
means the date 30 days before the Effective Date, or another date agreed
to by the Parties;
"Signing Date"
means the date on which this Agreement is signed by the Parties after
ratification of this Agreement by the Tla'amin Nation in accordance with
paragraph 3 of the Ratification Chapter; and
"Transition Date"
means the date that is 15 months after the Signing Date.
2. Where the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is
15 months or less, on the Revision Date each provisional payment amount
in the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be adjusted as follows:
provisional payment amount * M/L
where,
"*"
means multiplied by;
"/"
means divided by;
"M"
is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar
quarter for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before
the Revision Date; and
"L"
is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2010 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time that the values used in M are
published.
3. Where the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is
greater than 15 months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment
amount in the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be adjusted as follows:
provisional payment amount * [(P/Q) * (1 + CR)Y * (1+CR*D/365)]
where,
"*"
means multiplied by;
"/"
means divided by;
"P"
is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar
quarter for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before
the Transition Date;
"Q"
is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2010 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time that the values used in P are
published;
"CR"
is 4.635 per cent;
"Y"
is the number of complete years between the Transition Date and
the Effective Date; and
"D"
is the number of days remaining in the period between the
Transition Date and the Effective Date, after deducting the
complete years in that period that have been taken into account in
the determination of Y.
Note: The purpose of this paragraph is to limit the period for which the
Capital Transfer is adjusted by FDDIPI to the period that ends on the
Transition Date, and to lengthen the period for which the Capital
Transfer is adjusted by the calculation rate to the period between the
Transition Date and the Effective Date.
4. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment made in accordance
with either paragraph 2 or 3 of these notes:
a. the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be amended to incorporate the
adjusted figures;
b. the final amounts in the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be

NOTES FOR FINALIZING SCHEDULE 2
These notes will not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these
notes is to enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the
amounts to be shown in the final version of this Schedule.
The provisional loan repayment amounts are based on total outstanding
negotiation loans and interest accrued up to March 31, 2010. Final
negotiation loan repayment amounts, including any further loans made and
interest accrued after March 31, 2010, will be calculated and included
in the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan in accordance with the
following notes.
1. In these notes:
"Revision Date"
has the same meaning as in Schedule 1 of this Chapter.
2. Prior to the Revision Date, Canada and the Tla'amin Nation will
jointly produce a document capturing the final loan and interest amounts
as at the Effective Date and setting out the amounts of all loans from
Canada to the Sliammon Indian Band, all interest accrued to date and the
relevant terms and conditions of those loans.
3. On the Revision Date, the provisional negotiation loan repayment
amounts in the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan will be adjusted to final
negotiation loan repayment amounts by:
a. determining the amount of the additional negotiation loans made by
Canada to the Sliammon Indian Band which were not included in the
calculation of the provisional negotiation loan repayment amounts and
any additional interest accrued since the provisional negotiation loan
and interest amounts were calculated; and
b. pro-rating the additional amounts determined under subparagraph 3.a
of these notes over the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan such that the
final repayment amounts are equal amounts, using as an interest rate
4.635% per year beginning at the Effective Date and compounded annually,
which is the same rate of interest that was used to establish the
provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan.
4. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in
accordance with paragraph 3 of these notes, the Negotiation Loan
Repayment Plan will be amended to incorporate the adjusted figures and
the headings in the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan will be replaced by
the following headings:
REPAYMENT DATE
NEGOTIATION LOAN
REPAYMENT AMOUNT
CHAPTER 19 â RESOURCE REVENUE SHARING
1. Commencing on the first Payment Date and on each subsequent Payment
Date, Canada will make one Resource Revenue Payment to the Tla'amin
Nation.
2. Commencing on the first Payment Date and on each subsequent Payment
Date, British Columbia will make one Resource Revenue Payment to the
Tla'amin Nation.
3. Each Resource Revenue Payment will be calculated 30 days before the
corresponding Payment Date, using the following formula:
Resource Revenue Payment = 50% * [$662,584 * (Payment Date FDDIPI/First
Quarter 2010 FDDIPI)]
where,
"*"
means multiplied by;
"/"
means divided by;
"FDDIPI"
means the Final Domestic Demand Implicit Price Index for Canada,
series D100466, published regularly by Statistics Canada in Matrix
10512: Implicit Price Indexes, Gross Domestic Product, or its
replacement series as specified by Statistics Canada.
For each Payment Date:
"Payment Date FDDIPI"
is the first published FDDIPI for the latest calendar quarter for
which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI 30 days before that
Payment Date; and
"First Quarter 2010 FDDIPI"
is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2010 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time that the values used in Payment
Date FDDIPI are published.
CHAPTER 20 â FISCAL RELATIONS
1. The Parties acknowledge that they each have a role in supporting the
Tla'amin Nation, through direct or indirect financial support or through
access to public programs and services, as set out in the Fiscal
Financing Agreement or provided through other arrangements.
2. Every five years, or other periods as may be agreed, the Parties will
negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on a Fiscal Financing Agreement
that will:
a. set out the Agreed Upon Programs and Services, including, where
appropriate, the recipients of those programs and services;
b. set out the responsibilities of each of the Parties in respect of the
Agreed Upon Programs and Services;
c. set out the funding for Agreed Upon Programs and Services;
d. set out the Tla'amin Nation's contribution to the funding of Agreed
Upon Programs and Services from its own source revenues as determined
under paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Chapter;
e. set out mechanisms for the transfer of funds to the Tla'amin Nation
from Canada or British Columbia;
f. set out procedures for:
i. the collection and exchange of information, including statistical and
financial information, required for the administration of Fiscal
Financing Agreements;
ii. dispute resolution in relation to Fiscal Financing Agreements;
iii. accountability requirements, including those respecting reporting
and audit, of the Tla'amin Nation;
iv. negotiating the inclusion of additional programs and services to the
list of Agreed Upon Programs and Services within a Fiscal Financing
Agreement;
v. addressing exceptional circumstances and emergencies; and
vi. negotiation of subsequent Fiscal Financing Agreements; and
g. address other matters as agreed to by the Parties.
3. In negotiating a Fiscal Financing Agreement, the Parties will take
into account:
a. the cost of providing, either directly or indirectly, Agreed Upon
Programs and Services that are reasonably comparable to similar programs
and services available in other communities of similar size and
circumstance in southwestern British Columbia;
b. efficiency and effectiveness, including opportunities for economies
of scale, in the provision of Agreed Upon Programs and Services, which
may include, where appropriate, cooperative arrangements with other
governments, First Nations or existing service providers;
c. the costs of operating Tla'amin Government;
d. existing levels of funding provided by Canada or British Columbia;
e. prevailing fiscal policies of Canada or British Columbia;
f. the location and accessibility of communities on Tla'amin Lands;
g. the jurisdictions, authorities, programs and services assumed by the
Tla'amin Nation under this Agreement;
h. the desirability of reasonably stable, predictable and flexible
fiscal arrangements;
i. changes in price and volume, which may include the number of
individuals eligible to receive Agreed Upon Programs and Services; and
j. other matters as agreed to by the Parties.
4. In negotiating the Tla'amin Nation's contribution to the funding of
Agreed Upon Programs and Services from its own source revenues under
subparagraph 2.d, the Parties will take into account:
a. the capacity of the Tla'amin Nation to generate revenues;
b. the existing Tla'amin own source revenue arrangements negotiated
under this Agreement;
c. the prevailing fiscal policies with respect to the treatment of First
Nation own source revenue in self-government fiscal arrangements;
d. that own source revenue arrangements should not unreasonably reduce
incentives for the Tla'amin Nation to generate revenues;
e. that the reliance of the Tla'amin Nation on fiscal transfers should
decrease over time as it becomes more self-sufficient; and
f. other matters as agreed to by the Parties.
5. In negotiating the own source revenue contribution of the Tla'amin
Nation to the funding of Agreed Upon Programs and Services under
subparagraph 2.d, unless otherwise agreed:
a. own source revenue arrangements will not include:
i. Capital Transfer received under this Agreement, in the manner set out
in the initial agreement in respect of own source revenues;
ii. resource revenue sharing under this Agreement, in the manner set out
in the initial agreement in respect of own source revenues;
iii. proceeds from the sale of Tla'amin Lands or Other Tla'amin Lands;

or other agreements for programs and services with the Tla'amin Nation;
v. interest, gains or other income from the investment or reinvestment
of funds held in a Fish Fund established with funding received by the
Tla'amin Nation from Canada for a purpose related to the implementation
of this Agreement as set out in the initial agreement in respect of own
source revenues, or as agreed to by the Parties, provided that the
interest, gains or other income is reinvested in the fund or is used for
a purpose or activity that is intended by the Parties to be funded from
that fund;
vi. gifts or charitable donations;
vii. amounts received as compensation for specific losses or damages to
property or assets;
viii. a Specific Claim Settlement; or
ix. other sources agreed to by the Parties; and
b. own source revenue arrangements will not permit:
i. Canada to benefit from the decision of British Columbia to vacate tax
room or to transfer revenues or tax authorities to the Tla'amin Nation;
or
ii. British Columbia to benefit from the decision of Canada to vacate
tax room or to transfer revenues or tax authorities to the Tla'amin
Nation.
6. Where the Parties do not reach agreement on a subsequent Fiscal
Financing Agreement by the expiry date of an existing Fiscal Financing
Agreement, the existing Fiscal Financing Agreement will:
a. continue in effect for up to two years from its original expiry date,
or for such other period of time as the Parties may agree to in writing;
and
b. terminate on the earlier of:
i. the expiry of the extended term determined in accordance with
subparagraph 6.a; or
ii. the date of commencement of a subsequent Fiscal Financing Agreement.
7. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in a Fiscal Financing
Agreement, the creation of the Tla'amin Government, the provision of the
Tla'amin Nation's law-making authority under this Agreement or the
exercise of the Tla'amin Nation's law-making authority does not create
or imply any financial obligation or service responsibility on the part
of any Party.
8. For greater certainty, when the Parties agree in the initial Fiscal
Financing Agreement that Canada will provide one time federal funding to
the Tla'amin Nation to establish a Fish Fund to support the provision of
agreed upon implementation activities and Canada duly provides that
funding, Canada has no further obligation to negotiate and attempt to
reach agreement on the provision of additional federal funding for those
implementation activities.
9. Any funding required for the purposes of the Fiscal Financing
Agreement, or any other agreement that is reached as a result of
negotiations that are required or permitted under any provision of this
Agreement and that provides for financial obligations to be assumed by a
Party, is subject to the appropriation of funds:
a. in the case of Canada, by Parliament;
b. in the case of British Columbia, by the Legislature; or
c. in the case of the Tla'amin Nation, by the Tla'amin Government.
CHAPTER 21 â TAXATION
DIRECT TAXATION
1. The Tla'amin Nation may make laws in respect of:

not limit the taxation powers of Canada or British Columbia.
3. Notwithstanding paragraph 81 of the General Provisions Chapter, any
Tla'amin Law made under this Chapter, or any exercise of power by
Tla'amin Government, is subject to and will conform with International
Legal Obligations respecting taxation, and paragraphs 24 to 29 of the
General Provisions Chapter do not apply with respect to International
Legal Obligations respecting taxation.
TAXATION POWERS AGREEMENTS
4. From time to time, at the request of the Tla'amin Nation, Canada and
British Columbia, together or separately, may negotiate and attempt to
reach agreement with the Tla'amin Nation respecting:
a. the extent to which the Direct taxation law-making authority of the
Tla'amin Nation under subparagraph 1.a may be extended to apply to
Persons, other than Tla'amin Citizens, within Tla'amin Lands; and
b. the manner in which the Tla'amin Nation law-making authority under
subparagraph 1.a, as extended by the application of subparagraph 4.a,

an agreement contemplated under paragraph 4 may provide for an
alternative approach to the appeal, enforcement or adjudication of
matters relating to a Tla'amin Law in respect of taxation.
6. A Tla'amin Law with respect to taxation may provide for:
a. a fine that is greater than the limits set out in paragraph 149 of
the Governance Chapter; or
b. a term of imprisonment that is greater than the limit set out in
paragraph 151 of the Governance Chapter,
where there is an agreement to that effect as contemplated under
paragraph 4.
TLA'AMIN LANDS
7. The Tla'amin Nation is not subject to capital taxation, including

there are no improvements or on which there is a designated improvement.
8. In paragraph 7, "designated improvement" means:

9. In subparagraph 8.b, "public purpose" does not include the provision
of property or services primarily for the purpose of profit.
10. For the purposes of paragraphs 7 and 8:
a. for greater certainty, Tla'amin Lands include the improvements on
those lands; and
b. an improvement is deemed to be on the land that is necessarily
ancillary to the use of the improvement.
11. For greater certainty, the exemption from taxation in paragraph 7
does not apply to a taxpayer other than the Tla'amin Nation nor does it
apply with respect to a disposition of Tla'amin Lands, or interests in
those lands, by the Tla'amin Nation.
12. For federal and provincial income tax purposes, proceeds of
disposition received by the Tla'amin Nation on expropriation of Tla'amin
Lands in accordance with the Lands Chapter are not taxable.

13. A transfer of Tla'amin Capital under this Agreement and a
recognition of ownership of Tla'amin Capital under this Agreement are
not taxable.
14. For purposes of paragraph 13, an amount paid to a Tla'amin Citizen
is deemed to be a transfer of Tla'amin Capital under this Agreement
where the payment:
a. can reasonably be considered to be a distribution of a Capital
Transfer received by the Tla'amin Nation; and
b. becomes payable within 90 days and is paid within 270 days from the
date that the Tla'amin Nation receives the Capital Transfer.
15. For federal and provincial income tax purposes, Tla'amin Capital is

its fair market value on the later of:
a. the Effective Date; and

month after the eighth anniversary of the Effective Date; and
b. with respect to all other taxes, as of the first day of the first

19. Paragraph 17 will be interpreted to exempt an Indian with respect to
a property or interest, or with respect to the ownership, occupation,
possession or use thereof, in the same manner and under the same
conditions under which section 87 of the
Indian Act
would have applied, but for this Agreement, if the property were
situated on, or the interest were in, an Indian Reserve.
20. Paragraph 17 only applies to an Indian during the period that
section 87 of the
Indian Act
applies to that individual.
21. Where the Tla'amin Nation imposes a tax within Tla'amin Lands and
concludes a tax agreement for that purpose with Canada or British
Columbia as contemplated in paragraph 4, paragraph 17 does not apply to
the extent that the Tla'amin Nation, Canada or British Columbia, as the
case may be, imposes a tax that the particular taxation agreement
specifies is applicable to Tla'amin Citizens and other Indians within
Tla'amin Lands.
TAX TREATMENT AGREEMENT
22. The Parties will enter into a tax treatment agreement, which will
come into effect on the Effective Date.

relationships;

DISAGREEMENTS TO GO THROUGH STAGES
10. The Parties desire and expect that most Disagreements will be
resolved by informal discussions between or among the Parties, without
the necessity of invoking this Chapter.
11. Subject to this Agreement, Disagreements not resolved informally
will progress, until resolved, through the following stages:
a. Stage One: formal, unassisted efforts to reach agreement between or
among the Parties, in collaborative negotiations under Appendix X-1;

Parties with the assistance of a Neutral, who has no authority to
resolve the dispute, in a facilitated process under Appendix X-2, X-3,
X-4 or X-5, as applicable; and
c. Stage Three: final adjudication in arbitral proceedings under
Appendix X-6 or in judicial proceedings.
12. Except as otherwise provided, no Party may refer a Disagreement to
final adjudication in Stage Three without first proceeding through Stage
One and a facilitated process in Stage Two, as required in this Chapter.

judicial proceedings at any time:
a. to prevent the loss of a right to commence proceedings due to the
expiration of a limitation period; or

pending resolution of the Disagreement under this Chapter.
STAGE ONE: COLLABORATIVE NEGOTIATIONS
14. Where a Disagreement is not resolved by informal discussion, and a
Party directly engaged in the Disagreement wishes to invoke this
Chapter, that Party will deliver written notice under Appendix X-1 to
the other Parties, requiring the commencement of collaborative
negotiations.
15. Upon receiving notice under paragraph 14, each Party directly
engaged in the Disagreement will participate in the collaborative
negotiations.
16. A Party not directly engaged in the Disagreement may participate in
the collaborative negotiations by giving written notice to the other
Parties, preferably before the collaborative negotiations commence.

6.c, then, for all purposes under this Chapter, those negotiations will
be deemed collaborative negotiations.
18. Collaborative negotiations terminate in the circumstances set out in
Appendix X-1.
STAGE TWO: FACILITATED PROCESSES

have not resolved a Disagreement, a Party directly engaged in the
Disagreement may require the commencement of a facilitated process by

does not apply.
NEGOTIATING CONDITIONS

participating in collaborative negotiations or a negotiation component
of a facilitated process will:

the Disagreement has delivered a notice of arbitration to all Parties as
required under Appendix X-6, be referred to and finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with that Appendix.

will deliver a copy of the agreement to the other Party that is not
directly engaged in the Disagreement.

process, upon that Party delivering written notice to the participating
Parties to the arbitration within 15 days after receiving notice under
paragraph 27 or copy of a written agreement under paragraph 28.
31. Notwithstanding paragraph 30, an arbitral tribunal may make an order
adding a Party as a participating Party at any time if the arbitral
tribunal considers that:
a. the participating Parties will not be unduly prejudiced; or
b. the issues stated in the pleadings are materially different from
those identified in the notice to arbitrate under paragraph 27 or the
written agreement to arbitrate in paragraph 28,
and, in that event, the arbitral tribunal may make any order it
considers appropriate or necessary in the circumstances respecting
conditions, including the payment of costs, upon which the Party may be
added.

opinion of Hydro or TELUS, does or might interfere with or endanger the
Works, disrupt service to Hydro's or TELUS's customers, or pose a hazard
to persons or property in relation to the Works; and
(iv) clear the Area of the Works and keep it cleared (including pruning
or removal) of all or any part of any trees or growth which do or might,

persons or property in relation to the Works;
(c) to enjoy further rights as follows:
(i) Hydro and TELUS may, with the prior approval of the Grantor and any
party with a registered interest in the affected areas, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, cut trees or
growth outside the Area of the Works, if in the reasonable opinion of
Hydro or TELUS such trees or growth might interfere with or endanger the
Works (whether on or off the Lands) or pose a hazard to persons or
property in relation to the Works;
(ii) Hydro and TELUS may pass and repass over, and maintain, repair
replace and use, all roads, lanes and bridges on the Lands outside of
the Area of the Works with or without equipment, machinery and materials
to such extent as may reasonably be required by Hydro or TELUS in
relation to this Agreement;
(iii) if there are no suitable roads, lanes or bridges under paragraph
2.1 (c) (ii), Hydro and TELUS may either:
A. construct, maintain, repair, replace and pass and repass over roads,
lanes or bridges on the Lands; or
B. pass and repass over the Lands elsewhere than on roads, lanes and
bridges, with or without equipment, machinery and materials to such
extent as may reasonably be required by Hydro or TELUS in relation to
this Agreement, subject to prior approval of the route by the Grantor,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hydro and TELUS do not require such
approval if there is an emergency or a reasonably apprehended emergency
or for the determination of electricity consumption, but will act
reasonably and report to the Grantor the purpose and extent of the
access as soon as practicable;
(iv) to conduct vegetation management upon the Area of the Works, such
as the planting of vegetation compatible with the undertakings of Hydro
or TELUS, and the application of herbicides and pesticides with the
consent of the Grantor, provided that Hydro and TELUS will not conduct
any aerial application of herbicides or pesticides on the Lands;
(v) to install, maintain and use gates in all fences which are now or
hereafter shall be on the Right of Way Area and in fences affecting
access to the Area of the Works;
(vi) to ground any structures, installation or things, by whomsoever

grounding will eliminate or reduce hazards to persons or property in
relation to the Works;
(vii) Hydro and TELUS may enter onto the Lands outside the Area of the
Works for the purpose of undertaking works to protect any Works located
within the Lands or within an Excluded Right of Way Area or to protect

A. Hydro or TELUS will before commencing such works deliver to the
Grantor for approval a written work plan describing the proposed work on
the Lands;
B. the Grantor will not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay
approval of such work plan, and shall take into consideration the effect
of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to the cost
of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not undertaking the
work. If Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, and the Grantor cannot
agree on a work plan requested by Hydro or TELUS within 30 days of
receipt by the Grantor of the proposed work plan, then either party may
refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under sectionÂ 18 of
this Agreement;
C. Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will pay compensation for any
damage to the Lands resulting from the implementation of the work plan;
D. if Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, determines in its reasonable
judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are imminent safety
concerns, Hydro and TELUS may, without approval of the Grantor,
undertake works and take such steps on the Lands as are reasonably
required to be taken immediately in order to protect the Works, or to
protect persons or property that may be at risk from the Works, and in
that event Hydro or TELUS will as soon as reasonably possible thereafter
notify the Grantor; and
(d) generally, do all such other acts or things as may reasonably be
necessary or incidental to the business of Hydro or TELUS in connection
with any of the above.
RIGHT OF WAY AREA
3.1 The Right of Way Area consists of:
(a) all portions of the Lands reasonably required for the following:
(i) those Works existing at the date of this Agreement;
(ii) any additional Works constructed adjacent to, along the sides of or
across any roads, lanes or bridges from time to time existing on or
through the Lands;
(iii) any additional Works that provide service to any lands adjacent to
any roads, lanes, or bridges from time to time existing on or through
the Lands;
(iv) any additional Works that provide service to any lands or customers
where the landowners of any intervening parcels consent to the
installation of any such Works; and
(b) any such other portions of the Lands as may from time to time be
consented to in writing by the Grantor, or by any delegate appointed by
the Grantor.
3.2 Hydro and TELUS agree to provide the Grantor on request with an
updated sketch of the Works from time to time, if the Works have been
extended in the previous calendar year, unless such information is
available to the Grantor on-line. The Parties confirm that this
Agreement, and all of its terms and provisions, shall apply to such new
works in their entirety.
3.3 Nothing in this Part 3.0 is intended to affect the rights of Hydro
or TELUS to make arrangements directly with a person in legal possession
of any lands for the construction, operation and maintenance of the
Works and all matters incidental thereto.
NON-EXCLUSIVE USE
4.1 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Hydro and TELUS
acknowledge and agree that:
(a) this Agreement does not grant a fee simple interest in the Lands,
but rather grants a non-exclusive use over the Area of the Works; and
(b) subject to the rights granted to Hydro and TELUS in this Agreement,
the Grantor may grant to third parties other interests on the Area of
the Works, provided that any such grant of other interests shall not
compromise or, by action of the Grantor or the grantee, damage, disrupt,
adversely affect or interfere with the use by Hydro and TELUS of the
Works or Area of the Works.
PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
5.1 Hydro and TELUS will undertake activities permitted under this
Agreement having regard for the impact on the Environment, and will take
prudent measures to minimize any danger or disruption to the
Environment. Hydro and TELUS, as the case may be, will remediate damage
they respectively may cause to the Environment in accordance with
applicable provincial or federal environmental legislation.
COVENANTS OF HYDRO AND TELUS
6.1 Hydro and TELUS each covenant separately with the Grantor to:
(a) pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies, charges and
assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account
of Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, which relate to the Right of Way
Area and which Hydro or TELUS is liable to pay;
(b) keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro or TELUS under this
Agreement in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the
condition relates to the use or occupation by Hydro or TELUS of such
Lands, as the case may be, provided that Hydro and TELUS have no
obligation to keep any roads within the Area of the Works suitable for
use by anyone except Hydro and TELUS;
(c) bury and maintain all underground works as may be required so as not
to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;
(d) if any human remains, burial pit or grave are unearthed or
discovered on the Lands by either Hydro or TELUS immediately notify the
Grantor, cease any further activity that could affected the site until
permitted by the Grantor to resume activity and take such reasonable
steps and precautions to protect the site as may be directed by the
Grantor;
(e) if any artifact is unearthed or discovered on the Lands by either
Hydro or TELUS, immediately notify the Grantor, cease any further
activity that could affect the site until permitted by the Grantor to
resume activity, and take such reasonable steps and precautions to
protect the site as may be directed by the Grantor. At the request of
the Grantor, Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will deliver such
artifact to a location on the Lands as directed by the Grantor, at the
expense of the Grantor if such expense is significant;
(f) not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in excavations
or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as
backfilling proceeds; and
(g) not commit or suffer any willful or voluntary waste, spoil or
destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon
anything that may be or become a nuisance to the Grantor, except to the
extent required by Hydro or TELUS, acting reasonably, to exercise the
rights granted under this Agreement.
NEW WORKS CONSTRUCTED BY HYDRO OR TELUS
7.1 Prior to undertaking construction on the Lands of any new Works
which are not alterations, extensions or additions to existing Works,
Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will deliver to the Grantor for
prior approval, a sketch plan showing with reasonable accuracy the
location of such new Works, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.
RELOCATION OF HYDRO AND TELUS WORKS DUE TO CHANGE
8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way

relocation of the Works for approval by the Grantor, which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
(b) Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will take into account any
likely material effect of the relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the

fenced off or enclosed, the Grantor will notify Hydro and TELUS, who
will provide such safe access as may be reasonably required by the
Grantor for a visual inspection.
RESTORATION
13.1 When a portion of the Right of Way Area is no longer required for

be, will:
(a) compensate the Grantor for such damages, to the extent caused by
Hydro or TELUS;
(b) compensate the Grantor for and remediate the Lands from such
contamination, to the extent caused by Hydro; or

non-performance of the Grantor, and not for any matters based on
nuisance or the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher unless Hydro was negligent.
17.2 TELUS will at all times save harmless and indemnify and keep
indemnified the Grantor from and against all claims, demands, actions,
suits or other legal proceedings by whomsoever made or brought against

pursuant to this Agreement contribute to any detrimental environmental
changes for which remedial action is necessary in accordance with
regulations and standards established by applicable Tla'amin, federal
and/or provincial legislation, Shaw will immediately undertake, at its
own cost, the required remedial action to the extent of its
contribution.
8.2 Shaw acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding any rule of law
to the contrary, any Hazardous Substances, which are located, stored or
incorporated in or on the Permit Area or any part of the Lands as a
result of any action or inaction on behalf of Shaw will remain the sole
and exclusive property of Shaw and will not become the property of
Tla'amin regardless of any degree of affixation of the Hazardous
Substances to the Permit Area or the Lands. This section will survive
the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, save only that,
to the extent that the performance of any obligation pertaining to it
requires access to or entry upon the Permit Area after the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement, Shaw will have entry and access
to the Permit Area.

remains unearthed or discovered by it in the course of its operations on
or at the Permit Area and will cease any further activity that could

or remains, ensuring the preservation of the same. Tla'amin retains the
exclusive right to take possession of said Artifact and move or relocate
it as Tla'amin deems appropriate. If the human remains turn out to be
Tla'amin ancestral remains, Tla'amin retains the exclusive right to
remove or re-bury the remains according to Tla'amin laws and traditions.

Document 6. Tla'amin Nation Upland Owner Consent
TO:
Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia
, as represented by the Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource
Operations ("British Columbia")
FROM:
Tla'amin Nation
("Tla'amin")
WHEREAS:
A. Tla'amin is the [registered] owner in fee simple of the land located
........................................, legally described as [INSERT
LEGAL DESCRIPTION] (the "Upland"); [Note: Insert Legal Description for
area immediately adjacent to foreshore. If Upland is not in LTO then
describe land as accurately as possible];
B. British Columbia is the owner in fee simple of the parcel or tract of
land being the foreshore fronting on the Upland and all land covered by
water adjoining the Upland (the "Foreshore");
C. The Upland and Foreshore are adjacent to each other and Tla'amin, as
owner of the Upland, is entitled to exercise its riparian right of
access to the Upland by crossing the Foreshore;
D. British Columbia wishes to interfere with Tla'amin's riparian right
of access to the Upland by authorizing, under an existing licence of
occupation (the "Licence"), the use of the identified portions of the
Foreshore for the purpose of constructing, using and maintaining a
floating residential home for non-commercial use on the portion of the
Foreshore shown outlined in bold on the attached Schedule "A" ("Float
Home Area") pursuant to a licence dated for reference â¢ and numberedâ¢,
which has a term expiring â¢; and
E. Tla'amin is prepared to consent to such interference pursuant to the
provisions set out below.
NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of
ONE ($1.00) dollar and other good and valuable consideration, now paid
by British Columbia to Tla'amin (the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:
1. Tla'amin, as owner of the Upland, on the terms set forth herein,
hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its
servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees
and all those claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the
Licence, with Tla'amin's right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and
repass over the Float Home Area to gain access to and from the Upland.
2. Tla'amin acknowledges and agrees that the Consent hereby given
entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents,
contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming
through them, in accordance with the Licence (collectively, the "Float
Home Area Users") to:
a) construct, erect, place, install, moor, maintain, replace, renovate
and repair buildings, structures, works, improvements and chattels
(collectively, the "Improvements") on all or any part of the Float Home
Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes
authorized and approved in the Licence, provided however that this
Consent does not extend so far as to permit British Columbia to
authorize the Float Home Area Users to alter or enlarge any Improvements
existing on the Float Home Area on â¢, or to construct, erect, place,
install or moor new Improvements on the Float Home Area after â¢, if such

land as accurately as possible];
A. British Columbia is the owner in fee simple of the parcel or tract of
land being the foreshore fronting on the Upland and all land covered by

B. The Upland and Foreshore are adjacent to each other and Tla'amin, as
owner of the Upland, is entitled to exercise its riparian right of
access to the Upland by crossing the Foreshore;
C. British Columbia wishes to interfere with Tla'amin's riparian right
of access to the Upland by authorizing, under an existing licence of
occupation (the "Licence"), the use of the identified portions of the
Foreshore for marine invertebrates aquaculture purposes on the portion
of the Foreshore shown outlined in bold on the attached Schedule "A"
("Aquaculture Area") pursuant to a licence dated for reference â¢ and

NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of

hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:
1. Tla'amin, as owner of the Upland, on the terms set forth herein,
hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its
servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees
and all those claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the
Licence, with Tla'amin's right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and
repass over the Aquaculture Area to gain access to and from the Upland.
2. Tla'amin acknowledges and agrees that the Consent hereby given
entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents,
contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming
through them, in accordance with the Licence (collectively, the
"Aquaculture Area Users") to:
a) construct, erect, place, install, moor, maintain, replace, renovate
and repair buildings, structures, works, improvements and chattels
(collectively, the "Improvements") on all or any part of the Aquaculture
Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes
authorized and approved in the Licence, provided however that this
Consent does not extend so far as to permit British Columbia to
authorize the Aquaculture Area Users to alter or enlarge any
Improvements existing on the Aquaculture Area on â¢, or to construct,
erect, place, install or moor new Improvements on the Aquaculture Area
after â¢, if such alteration, enlargement, construction, erection,
placement, installation or mooring would materially interfere with
reasonable access to the Upland; and
b) do all other acts within the Aquaculture Area, reasonably necessary
or incidental to the purposes authorized and approved in connection with
the Licence.
3. Tla'amin or any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be,

proposes to dispose of any portion of the Upland which borders on the
Foreshore, which notice will be received by that person prior to such
disposition. Prior to or concurrently with such disposition, Tla'amin or
any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be, will obtain a
written ratification of this Consent by the transferee of such portion
of the Upland in the same form as this Consent and will deliver an
originally executed copy thereof to British Columbia. For the purposes
of this paragraph, the word "dispose" means any transfer by any method
to any person entitled to exercise a riparian right of access to the
Upland.
4. British Columbia covenants and agrees with Tla'amin that nothing in
this Consent will be deemed or otherwise construed so as to permit
British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants,
invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, to enter onto
the Upland or to construct, place, erect or install any buildings,
structures, improvements or works thereon.
5. This Consent is effective from and after â¢, 201â¢ ("Effective Date")
until â¢, the end of any renewal term, or the earlier termination of

the Easement Area, in accordance with paragraph 8; and
(r) to immediately notify the Owner if the Grantee discovers any human
remains, burial pit, grave or artifacts on or under the Land, to cease
any further activities that could affect the site until permitted by the
Owner to resume activities and take all reasonable steps and precautions
to minimize disturbance of that material, and to immediately notify the
Owner.
10.
Cancellation
Despite any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may be
cancelled if the Grantee fails or refuses to observe or perform any term
in this Agreement, and the failure continues after the Owner gives
written notice of the failure to the Grantee for a period of:
(a) 30 days; or
(b) 150 days, if the failure because of its nature reasonably requires
more than 30 days to cure, and provided that the Grantee proceeds
diligently and continuously to cure the failure,
then the Owner may by further written notice to the Grantee cancel this
Agreement and despite paragraph 9 (k), any improvements to the Easement
Area will, at the discretion of the Owner, become the property of the
Owner.
11.
Relocation of Easement Area
If the Owner requires the Easement Area for another purpose, the Owner
may, on 180 days written notice to the Grantee and in consultation with
the Grantee:
(a) at the Owner's cost locate and construct an alternate road providing
access to the Grantee's Property to a standard at least equivalent to
the original road;
(b) grant a replacement agreement for the alternate road on the same
terms as this Agreement; and
(c) by further written notice to the Grantee cancel this Agreement;
and on cancellation the Grantee will quit peaceably and deliver
possession of the Easement Area, except that the Grantee may, at its
election, within 60 days of the cancellation, or such longer time as
reasonably required, remove any fixtures from the Easement Area, but the
Grantee will not be required to comply with paragraph 9 (k) (ii).
12.
Third Party Notice
The Owner will not dispose of, or agree to dispose of, the Servient
Lands without first notifying any intended purchaser of the existence of
this Agreement.
13.
Ownership of Timber
All timber on the Easement Area will remain the property of the Owner.
14.
Security
The Grantee will deliver the Security to the Owner within 30 days of the
commencement of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Grantee's
use of the Easement Area, as security for the performance of the
Grantee's obligations under this Agreement, and the following will
apply:
(a) the Grantee will maintain the Security in full until the later of:
(i) the termination of this Agreement; or
(ii) the complete fulfillment of all of the Grantee's obligations under
this Agreement;
(b) if the Grantee defaults in the performance of any of its obligations
under this Agreement, the Owner may, in its sole election, draw on and
use the Security to reimburse the Owner for all reasonable costs and
expenses, including legal and other professional services costs if any,
caused by or arising out of the Grantee's breach, and in the event of a
call on the Security of the Grantee will, as a condition of the
continuation of this Agreement, immediately pay to the Owner the amount
of the draw so that the full amount of the Security is available.
The parties agree that the amount of the Security does not constitute a
liquidated damages estimate of the Owner's damages if the Grantee
breaches its obligations hereunder and the Owner reserves its right to
claim for further damages.
15.
Disputes
Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement will be
resolved as follows:
(a) the parties will attempt to resolve disputes by negotiations,
including timely disclosure of all relevant facts, information and
documents;
(b) either party may, at any time, by written notice request that the
dispute be referred to mediation, conducted by a mediator, knowledgeable
about the matters in dispute;
(c) if the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of the notice to
mediate under subparagraph (b) then, on the agreement of both parties,
the dispute may be referred to a single arbitrator for final resolution.
If the parties do not agree to arbitration then either party may refer
the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction;
except that it is not incompatible with this paragraph for a party to
apply to a court at any time for interim or conservatory relief, and for
the court to grant that relief.
16.
Notice
If notice is required or permitted under this Agreement, the notice:
(a) must be in writing;
(b) must be delivered to the address set out above, or other address as
specified in writing by a party; and
(c) may be given in one or more of the following ways:
(i) delivered personally or by courier, and it will be deemed received
on the next business day;
(ii) delivered by fax, and it will be deemed received on the next
business day; or
(iii) mailed by pre-paid post in Canada, and it will be deemed received
on the eighth business day following, except in the case of mail
interruption in which case actual receipt is required.
17.
Waiver and Consent
A breach of any term, condition, covenant or other provision of this
Agreement may only be waived in writing, and any waiver will not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. Consent to or approval
of any act, where consent or approval is required under this Agreement,
will not be construed as consent to or approval of any subsequent act.
18.
Remedies
No remedy set out in this Agreement is exclusive of any other remedy
provided by law, but will be in addition to any other remedy existing at
law, in equity, or by statute.
19.
Enurement
The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall extend to, be binding
upon and enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors
and permitted assigns.
20.
Entire Agreement
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and
no understanding or agreement, oral or otherwise, exists between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement except as
expressly set out in this Agreement and this Agreement may not be
modified except by subsequent written agreement.
21.
Interpretation
In this Agreement:
(a) all attached schedules form an integral part of this Agreement;
(b) unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the
plural and the masculine includes the feminine gender, body politic and
a corporation;
(c) the headings are for convenience only and are not to be construed as
defining or in any way limiting the scope or intent of the Agreement;
(d) a reference to an enactment of British Columbia or of Canada will be
deemed to include a reference to any subsequent amendments or
replacements; and
(e) if any provision is determined by a court or arbitrator of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be
considered separate and severable, and the legality or enforceability of
the remaining provisions will not be affected by that determination.
22. Each party will, upon the request of the other, do or cause to be
done all lawful acts necessary for the performance of the provisions of
this Agreement.
23. Wherever this Agreement provides that an action may be taken, a
consent or approval must be obtained or a determination must be made,
then the Owner or the Grantee, as the case may be, will act reasonably
in taking such action, deciding whether to provide such consent or
approval or making such determination; but where this Agreement states
that the Owner or the Grantee have sole discretion to take an action,
provide a consent or approval or make a determination, there will be no
requirement to show reasonableness or to act reasonably in taking that
action, providing that consent or approval or making that determination.
24. If, due to a strike, lockout, labour dispute, act of God, inability
to obtain labour or materials, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order
of a competent governmental authority, enemy or hostile action, civil
commotion, fire or other casualty or any condition or case beyond the
Grantee's reasonable control, other than normal weather conditions, the
Grantee is delayed in performing any of its obligations under this
Agreement, the time for the performance of that obligation will be
extended by a period of time equal to the period of time of the delay so
long as:
(a) the Grantee gives notice to the Owner within 30 days of the
commencement of the delay setting forth the nature of the delay and an
estimated time frame for the performance of its obligation; and
(b) the Grantee diligently attempts to remove the delay.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have duly executed this Agreement, as of
the date first referred to above.

from any accident or occurrence on the Land to an amount not less than
$1,000,000.00; except that so long as the Licensee is Her Majesty the
Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia or a British Columbia
crown corporation, the Owner will waive the requirements of this
subsection on the delivery to the Owner of confirmation that the
Licensee is self insured;
(k) notwithstanding subsection (j), the Owner may from time to time
notify the Licensee that the amount of insurance posted by the Licensee
pursuant to that subsection be changed and the Licensee shall, within 60
days of receiving such notice, cause the amount of insurance posted,
pursuant to subsection (j), to be changed to the amount specified by the
Owner, acting reasonably, in the notice and deliver to the Owner written
confirmation of the change, except that when the Licensee is

any other person who enters on or uses or occupies the Land under a
subsequent right or interest granted by the Owner, or who is otherwise

the Land to a British Columbia crown corporation provided that the
Licensee gives written notice of any such change at least 120 days prior
to the next anniversary date of the term of this licence.
5.3 No assignment or sublicensing pursuant to sections 5.1 or 5.2, nor
the Owner's consent thereto, will relieve the Licensee from the
observance and performance of the Licensee's obligations contained in
this licence.
ARTICLE 6 â CANCELLATION
6.1 If the Licensee fails to observe or perform any term contained
herein, and such failure continues after the giving of the written
notice by the Owner to the Licensee of the nature of the failure for a
period of:
(a) 30 days; or
(b) 150 days, if the failure because of its nature would reasonably
require more than 30 days to cure, and provided that the Licensee is
proceeding diligently and continuously to cure the failure throughout;
then the Owner may cancel this licence and, notwithstanding subsection
(i) of section 4.1, any fixtures to the Land shall become, at the
discretion of the Owner, the property of the Owner.
6.2 If this licence is taken in execution or attachment by any person,

with his creditors, the Owner may, on 90 days written notice to the

6.3 If the Licensee ceases to use the Land for the purposes permitted
herein and the Licensee does not recommence its use of the Land within
180 days of receipt of written notice from the Owner, the Owner may
immediately cancel this licence and the rights herein granted.

equipment and apparatus, or other improvements to the Land
(collectively, the "Improvements") that remain unremoved from the Land:
(a) upon the cancellation of this licence pursuant to section 6.1, or
section 6.4; or
(b) thirty days after the expiration or cancellation of this licence
pursuant to section 6.2 or section 6.3 (provided that if further time is
reasonably required because of the nature of the Improvements or because
of other constraints beyond the control of the Licensee, including
weather, and provided that the Licensee is proceeding diligently and
continuously to remove such Improvements, the 30 day time for removal
will be extended to 150 days after the expiration or cancellation of
this licence)
shall, at the discretion of the Owner, be forfeited to and become the
property of the Owner.
6.6 If the Owner elects to assume ownership of any above-ground
Improvements pursuant to section 6.5, the Owner may remove them from the
Land and the Licensee shall, on demand, compensate the Owner for all
costs incurred by the Owner respecting their removal.
6.7 The rights of the Owner under section 6.5 and section 6.6 shall be
deemed to survive the expiration or earlier cancellation of this
licence.
ARTICLE 7 â SECURITY
7.1 The security in the sum of $1.00 and all rights, privileges,
benefits and interests accruing thereto delivered by the Licensee to the
Owner (herein called the "Security") to guarantee the performance of the
Licensee's obligations under this licence shall be maintained in effect
until such time as the Owner certifies in writing that such obligations
have been fully performed. So long as the Licensee is Her Majesty the
Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia or a British Columbia
crown corporation, the Owner will waive the requirements of this
section.
7.2 If the Licensee defaults in the performance of any of its
obligations hereunder, the Owner may, in its sole discretion, sell, call
in and convert the Security, or any part of it, and such Security shall
be deemed to have been absolutely forfeited to the Owner.
7.3 The rights of the Owner under this Article shall be deemed to
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the expiration or
earlier cancellation of this licence.
7.4 Notwithstanding any amount of Security stated to be required under
section 7.1 the Owner may, acting reasonably, from time to time by
notice to the Licensee, demand the amount to be changed to that
specified in a notice and the Licensee shall, within 60 days of such
notice, change the Security to that specified and provide the Owner with
evidence of the change, except that while Security is waived under
section 7.1, this section shall not apply.
ARTICLE 8 â NOTICE
8.1 Whenever service of a notice or a document is required under this
licence, the notice or documents shall be in writing and shall be deemed
to have been served if delivered to, or if sent by prepaid registered
mail addressed to, the Owner or the Licensee, as the case may be, at the
addresses specified for each on the first page of this licence, and
where service is by registered mail the notice or document shall be
conclusively deemed to have been served on the eighth day after its
deposit in a Canada Post office at any place in Canada. If there is a
disruption in mail service caused by labour dispute, civil unrest or
other events beyond the control of the parties, between mailing and
actual receipt of such notice, the party sending such notice will
re-send by courier, fax or other electronic means and such notice will
only be effective if actually received.
8.2 Either party may, by notice in writing to the other, specify another
address for service of notices under this licence and after another
address has been specified under this section, notices shall be mailed
to that address in accordance with this Article.
ARTICLE 9 â MISCELLANEOUS
9.1 No term, condition, covenant or other provision herein shall be
considered to have been waived by the Owner unless such waiver is
expressed in writing by the Owner. Any such waiver of any term,
condition, covenant or other provision herein shall not be construed as
or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach of the same or any
other term, condition, covenant, or other provision and the consent or
approval of the Owner to any act by the Licensee requiring the consent
or approval of the Owner shall not be considered to waive or render
unnecessary such consents or approvals to any subsequent similar act by
the Licensee.
9.2 No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Owner is exclusive of
any other remedy herein or provided by law, but such remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy herein or
hereafter existing at law, in equity, or by statute.
9.3 This licence shall not entitle the Licensee to exclusive possession
of the Land and the Owner may, for any purpose, grant to others
interests in the Land or rights to enter on or use or occupy the Land,
or may otherwise authorize other persons to enter on or use or occupy
the Land, so long as the grant or authorization does not materially
affect the exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder. The question of
whether a grant materially affects the exercise of the Licensee's rights
hereunder shall be determined by the Owner acting reasonably. If the
Owner, by written instrument, grants a licence, right or interest to
others to use or occupy the Land, such grant will contain a provision
identical to subsection 4.1 (f) of this licence obligating the new
grantee to keep the Land in a safe, clean and sanitary condition
satisfactory to the Owner.
9.4 The terms and provisions of this licence shall extend to, be binding
upon and enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors
and permitted assigns.
9.5 Time is of the essence in this agreement.
ARTICLE 10 â DISPUTE RESOLUTION
10.1 In this Article, "dispute" means any dispute arising out of or in
connection with this licence or in respect of any defined legal
relationship associated with it or derived from it.
10.2 The parties agree to attempt to resolve all disputes by
negotiations conducted in good faith and to provide timely disclosure of
all relevant facts, information and documents to further those
negotiations.
10.3 If a dispute is not settled through direct negotiations either
party may request the British Columbia International Commercial
Arbitration Centre (BCICAC) to appoint a mediator to conduct a mediation
under its mediation rules of procedure.
10.4 If a dispute is not settled within 15 days of the appointment of
the mediator or any further period of time agreed to by the parties, the
dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration before
a single arbitrator under the arbitration rules of procedure of the
BCICAC.
10.5 If the BCICAC is unavailable or unable to administer the mediation
or arbitration of a dispute under its rules of procedure, the parties
will select the rules of another institution.
ARTICLE 11 â INTERPRETATION
11.1 In this licence, unless the context otherwise requires, the
singular includes the plural and the masculine includes the feminine
gender and a corporation.
11.2 The captions and headings contained in this licence are for
convenience only and are not to be construed as defining or in any way
limiting the scope or intent of the provisions herein.
11.3 If any section of this licence or any part of a section is found to
be illegal or unenforceable, that part or section, as the case may be,
shall be considered separate and severable and the remaining parts and
sections of this licence shall not be affected thereby and shall be
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this licence as of the day
and year first above written.

Agreement modifies its application.
2. A Provincial Expropriating Authority may expropriate an estate or
interest in Tla'amin Lands only with the consent and by the order of the
Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.
3. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may issue an order consenting to
an expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands only:
a. after the conclusion of the procedures described in Sections 4 and 5:
and
b. where the expropriation is justifiable in accordance with Section 6.
4. Before the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council makes a decision under

Tla'amin Nation a report which states the reasons for the expropriation
and addresses the factors under Sections 6. a and 6. d.
5. Within 30 days of receipt of the report under Section 4, Tla'amin
Nation will notify the Provincial Expropriating Authority if it objects
to the expropriation of the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands and,
within 30 days of the Provincial Expropriating Authority's receipt of
notice from the Tla'amin Nation, the Provincial Expropriating Authority
and the Tla'amin Nation will make reasonable efforts to resolve the
objection raised by the Tla'amin Nation.
6. For the purposes of Section 3. b an expropriation is justifiable
where the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council is satisfied that, in addition
to the applicable requirements under Provincial Law, the following
requirements have been met:
a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative to the
expropriation, including the use of lands that are not Tla'amin Lands;
b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Provincial Expropriating
Authority to acquire the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands through
agreement with the Tla'amin Nation;
c. the Provincial Expropriating Authority has confirmed that the

or interest held by the Tla'amin Nation, the dispute will be finally
determined by arbitration. A dispute under this Section will not delay
the expropriation. For the purposes of this Section British Columbia
will act on behalf of the Provincial Expropriating Authority on such
terms as British Columbia and the Provincial Expropriating Authority may
agree.

12. Where less than the fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands
is expropriated by a Provincial Expropriating Authority:
a. the parcel of land retains its status as Tla'amin Lands;

the Tla'amin Law is inconsistent with the use of land for which the
expropriation took place; and
c. the Tla'amin Nation may continue to use and occupy the parcel of
land, except to the extent that such use or occupation interferes with
the use of land for which the expropriation took place.
13. Sections 14 to 20 do not apply to an expropriation by a Provincial
Expropriating Authority of less than the fee simple estate in a parcel
of Tla'amin Lands.
EXPROPRIATION OF A FEE SIMPLE ESTATE
14. Where a fee simple estate in Tla'amin Lands is expropriated by a
Provincial Expropriating Authority:
a. unless British Columbia and the Tla'amin Nation agree otherwise, the
expropriation will include the fee simple estate to Subsurface Resources
which will revert to British Columbia at the time of the expropriation;
b. unless the Provincial Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation
agree otherwise, the expropriation will include all other interests in
the land; and
c. those lands will no longer be Tla'amin Lands and Appendix C will be
amended in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the
Amendment Chapter.
15. For the purposes of Section 14:

transaction costs including the cost of surveying, registering and
transferring the land; and

Lands that is held by the Tla'amin Nation, British Columbia will make
reasonable efforts to identify and offer provincial Crown land of
comparable value within the Tla'amin Area to the Tla'amin Nation as
compensation.
17. Where there is no agreement between British Columbia and the
Tla'amin Nation on the provision of land as compensation under Section
16, British Columbia will provide the Tla'amin Nation with other
compensation according to Provincial Law.
18. Where the replacement land provided under Section 16 is of less than
comparable value, British Columbia will provide additional compensation
in accordance with Section 10.
19. Where the Tla'amin Nation accepts provincial Crown land as
replacement land, British Columbia will provide the Tla'amin Nation with
a certificate transferring the indefeasible title or, where applicable,
the registered title to the parcel of land to the Tla'amin Nation.
20. At the request of the Tla'amin Nation, British Columbia will consent
to the replacement land being added to Tla'amin Lands and, where Canada
consents to such replacement lands becoming Tla'amin Lands in accordance
with a request under paragraph 85 of the Lands Chapter, upon receipt by
the Tla'amin Nation of notice of the consent of each of British Columbia
and Canada Appendix C will be amended in accordance with the process set
out in paragraph 9 of the Amendment Chapter.
RETURN OF AN EXPROPRIATED ESTATE OR INTEREST
21. Where an expropriated estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands is no
longer required by the Provincial Expropriating Authority, the
expropriated estate or interest will be returned to the Tla'amin Nation

expropriated estate or interest.
22. Where the fee simple estate to a parcel of land under Section 21 is
transferred by the Provincial Expropriating Authority to the Tla'amin
Nation, the Tla'amin Nation may add the parcel to Tla'amin Lands upon
notice to Canada and British Columbia.
23. Upon receipt by Canada and British Columbia of notice under Section

in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the Amendment
Chapter.
INTERESTS ON REPLACEMENT OR RETURNED LAND
24. Replacement land accepted by the Tla'amin Nation under Section 19 or
land returned to the Tla'amin Nation under Section 21 will be subject
to:
a. where the parcel is not registered in the Land Title Office, any
interest granted by British Columbia that is not discharged at the time
of transfer unless the Tla'amin Nation and the interest holder agree to
a replacement interest, including any modifications agreed to in writing
by the Tla'amin Nation and the interest holder; and
b. where the parcel is registered in the Land Title Office, any
registered charge or registered encumbrance subject to their discharge
under the
Land Title Act
.

instruments and other documents in the Land Title Office as may be
required under the
Land Title Act
.

has been expropriated in fee simple by Provincial Expropriating
Authorities will not exceed a cumulative total of 300 hectares.
29. Where replacement land is provided under Section 19 or a fee simple
estate which is not replaced under Section 22 is returned to the
Tla'amin Nation in accordance with Section 21, the amount of Tla'amin
Lands that may be expropriated under Section 28 will be increased by the
amount replaced or returned.
30. For greater certainty, the cumulative total under Section 28 will

Appendix J-2
Federal Expropriation Procedures
DEFINITIONS
In this Appendix:
"Section"
means a section in this Appendix.
FEDERAL EXPROPRIATION PROCEDURES
1. The Governor-in-Council may consent to an expropriation of an estate
or interest in Tla'amin Lands where the expropriation is justifiable in
accordance with Section 3 and necessary for a public purpose.
2. For greater certainty, where a Federal Expropriating Authority seeks
to expropriate an interest in Tla'amin Lands under section 4.1 of the
Expropriation Act
, that expropriation will be deemed to be necessary for a public
purpose.
3. For the purposes of Section 1, an expropriation is justifiable where
the Governor-in-Council is satisfied that the following requirements
have been met:
a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative land to expropriate
that is not Tla'amin Lands;
b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Federal Expropriating
Authority to acquire the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands through
agreement with the Tla'amin Nation;
c. the smallest estate or interest necessary in Tla'amin Lands and for
the shortest time required for the purpose for which the interest in
land is sought is expropriated; and
d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that
would be protected from disclosure under Federal Law, has been provided
to the Tla'amin Nation.
4. Prior to the Governor-in-Council issuing an order consenting to the
expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands, the Federal
Expropriating Authority will provide to the Tla'amin Nation and the
Governor-in-Council, and make available to the public, a report stating
the justification for the expropriation and describing the steps taken
to satisfy the requirements of Section 3.
5. Where the Tla'amin Nation objects to the expropriation of an estate
or interest in Tla'amin Lands, it may, within 60 days after the report
has been provided to the Tla'amin Nation in accordance with Section 4
refer the dispute directly to neutral evaluation under Stage Two of the
Dispute Resolution Chapter for a review of the steps taken to satisfy
the requirement set out Section 3.
6. The Federal Expropriating Authority will not seek Governor-in-Council
consent to the expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands:
a. before the expiration of the period referred to in Section 5;
b. where the Tla'amin Nation has referred the dispute to a neutral
evaluator in accordance with Section 5, before:
i. the neutral evaluator has delivered to Tla'amin Nation and the
Federal Expropriating Authority an opinion on the dispute, such opinion
to be rendered within 60 days of the referral being made; and
ii. the Federal Expropriating Authority has delivered the opinion of the
neutral evaluator to the Governor-in-Council for consideration under
Sections 1 and 2; or
c. within such additional time as the Tla'amin Nation and the Federal
Expropriating Authority may agree.
7. Without limiting the generality of the Dispute Resolution Chapter,
the opinion of the neutral evaluator under Section 6:
a. is without prejudice to the legal positions that may be taken by a
Federal Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation in court or in
any other forum;
b. will not be admissible in any legal proceedings, unless otherwise
required by law; and
c. is not binding on the Governor-in-Council under Sections 1 and 3.
8. At the time of the expropriation the Tla'amin Nation and the Federal
Expropriating Authority will negotiate the terms and conditions of the
return of an expropriated estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands,
including requirements relating to financial considerations based on
fair market value and the condition of the land to be returned.
9. Where the terms and conditions of the return of an expropriated
estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands cannot be agreed upon by the
Tla'amin Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority at the time of
the expropriation, the dispute will be finally determined by arbitration
under the Dispute Resolution Chapter. For the purposes of this Section,
Canada will act on behalf of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
10. Where a fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands is
expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority, the Federal
Expropriating Authority will make reasonable efforts to:
a. identify replacement land of equivalent or greater size and
comparable value within the Tla'amin Area, being either federal Crown
land or lands available on a willing-seller willing-buyer basis; and
b. where acceptable to the Tla'amin Nation, to acquire and offer the
replacement land to the Tla'amin Nation as partial or full compensation
for the expropriation.
11. Subject to Section 15, if the replacement land identified by the
Federal Expropriating Authority would result in the total size of
Tla'amin Lands being less than at the Effective Date and the Tla'amin
Nation does not agree that the replacement land is of comparable value
to the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands being expropriated, the
Tla'amin Nation may refer the dispute to be finally determined by
arbitration under the Dispute Resolution Chapter.
12. Where the Federal Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation
are unable to agree on the provision of replacement land as
compensation, the Federal Expropriating Authority will provide the
Tla'amin Nation with other compensation in accordance with this
Agreement.
13. The total value of compensation for an estate or interest in
Tla'amin Lands expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority under
this Appendix will be determined by taking into account the following
factors:
a. the fair market value of the expropriated estate or interest;
b. the replacement value of any improvement to Tla'amin Lands in which
an estate or interest has been expropriated;
c. any expenses or losses resulting from the disturbance directly
attributable to the expropriation;
d. any reduction in the value of any estate or interest in Tla'amin
Lands that is not expropriated which directly relates to the
expropriation;
e. any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of Tla'amin
Lands in which an estate or interest has been expropriated provided
that:
i. the cultural or other special value is only applied to an estate or
interest in Tla'amin Lands recognized in law and held by the Tla'amin
Nation; and
ii. there will be no increase in the total value of compensation on
account of any aboriginal rights, title or interest; and
f. the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or
incidental to the occupation or use of Tla'amin Lands to the extent that
the value is not otherwise compensated.
14. Subject to Section 15, if the Federal Expropriating Authority and
the Tla'amin Nation cannot agree on the total value of compensation or
on whether the combination of replacement land and other compensation is
equal to the total value of compensation, either Canada acting on behalf
of the Federal Expropriating Authority or the Tla'amin Nation may refer
the dispute for resolution under the Dispute Resolution Chapter.
15. A dispute in respect of:
a. the valuation of replacement land under Section 11;
b. the total value of compensation under Section 13; or
c. the terms and conditions of the return of land under Section 8,
will not delay the expropriation.
16. Any claim or incumbrance with respect to the estate or interest
expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority may only be discharged
against the amount of compensation payable under Section 13.
17. Interest on compensation is payable from the date the expropriation
takes effect at the interest rate payable under Federal Law.
18. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates a fee simple
estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands, the lands will no longer be
Tla'amin Lands and Appendix C will be amended in accordance with the
process set out in paragraph 9 of the Amendment Chapter.
19. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates less than a fee
simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands:
a. the parcel of lands retains its status as Tla'amin Lands;
b. the parcel of lands remains subject to Tla'amin Law, except to the
extent that such law interferes with the use of the parcel of lands for
which the expropriation took place; and
c. the Tla'amin Nation may continue to use and occupy the parcel of
lands, except to the extent the use or occupation is inconsistent with
the use of the parcel for which the expropriation took place, in the
view of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
20. Where replacement land is transferred to the Tla'amin Nation as
partial or full compensation in accordance with Section 10, the Tla'amin
Nation may request that land be added to Tla'amin Lands.
21. Canada and British Columbia will consent to the land referred to in
Section 20 being added to Tla'amin Lands where:
a. the land is within the Tla'amin Area;
b. the land does not overlap with an area over which another First
Nation claims a legal interest or which is subject to treaty
negotiations with another First Nation, except where the other First
Nation in those cases consents to the addition;
c. the land is outside municipal boundaries unless the municipality
consents; and
d. Canada or British Columbia will not be required to assume financial
or other obligations, associated with the replacement land.
22. Where Canada and British Columbia consent under Section 21, each of
them will provide notice of its consent to the other Parties. Upon
receipt by the Tla'amin Nation of the notices, Appendix C will be
amended in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the
Amendment Chapter.
23. Where an expropriated estate or interest in a parcel of Tla'amin
Lands is no longer required by the Federal Expropriating Authority for
the purpose for which it was expropriated, the Federal Expropriating
Authority will ensure that the estate or interest in land is returned to
the Tla'amin Nation on the terms and conditions negotiated under Section
8.
24. The return of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands under Section
23 will not result in Canada or British Columbia assuming financial or
other obligations, unless agreed to in writing at the time of the
expropriation.
25. Where the Tla'amin Nation becomes the registered owner of the fee
simple estate to a parcel of land under Section 23, the Tla'amin Nation
may add that parcel to Tla'amin Lands upon notice to Canada and British
Columbia.
26. Upon receipt by Canada and British Columbia of a notice under
Section 25, the parcel will become Tla'amin Lands and Appendix C will be
amended in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the
Amendment Chapter.
27. The federal department or agency or other entity that holds the
expropriated estate or interest may decide, without the consent of the
Governor-in-Council, that the expropriated estate or interest in land is
no longer required and may determine the disposition of any improvements
made to the land in a manner consistent with an agreement reached under
Section 8 or the outcome of an arbitration under Section 9.
28. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 9, 11 and 14, no dispute
between Canada and the Tla'amin Nation respecting the interpretation,
application or implementation of paragraphs 127 and 129 of the Lands
Chapter or Sections 1 to 27 will be resolved under the Dispute
Resolution Chapter.
29. Subject to Section 30, except to the extent that the provisions of
the Lands Chapter and this Appendix modify the application of federal
expropriation legislation in respect of an expropriation of Tla'amin
Lands, all expropration legislation applies to an expropriation in
respect of Tla'amin Lands under the Lands Chapter and this Appendix.
30. Without limiting the generality of paragraph 10 of the General
Provisions Chapter, this Agreement prevails to the extent of a Conflict
with the federal
Expropriation Act
or other Federal Law relating to the expropriation.
31. Where the fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands is held by
a Tla'amin Citizen, a Tla'amin Institution or a Tla'amin Corporation,
any interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal
Expropriating Authority in accordance with:
a. Federal Law;
b. the consent of the Governor-in-Council; and
c. Sections 1 through 9, 15. c, 18, 19 and 23 through 27, and
for greater certainty, any return of land under Sections 23 through 27
will be to the Tla'amin Nation.

42. An Arbitral Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction.
43. A plea that an Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction will be

Party is not precluded from raising that plea by the fact that the Party
has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.

Section 43 or 44, admit a later plea where it considers the delay
justified.

the arbitration under paragraph 42 of the Chapter.

129. A Party may appeal an Arbitral Award to the Supreme Court, with
leave, on a question of law, which the Supreme Court will grant only

the Tla'amin Nation was not a Party in an arbitration, it will not bring
an application under Section 124 or 129 to set aside or appeal the
Arbitral Award, but may resist enforcement of the award against it by
bringing an application under Section 141.
141. On the application of Canada, British Columbia or the Tla'amin
Nation where it was not a Party in an arbitration, the Supreme Court may
make an order refusing to enforce against it an Arbitral Award made

i. the notice of arbitration or agreement to arbitrate; or
ii. the pleadings or all amendments and supplements to the pleadings;
b. the Arbitral Tribunal refused to add it as a Party to the arbitration
under paragraph 31 of the Chapter;
c. the Arbitral Award:
i. deals with a Disagreement not contemplated by or not falling within
the terms of the submission to arbitration; or
ii. contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
arbitration,
provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can
be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the Arbitral
Award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may
be enforced;
d. the Arbitral Award has not yet become binding on the Parties or has
been set aside or suspended by a court;
e. the Arbitral Tribunal or a member of it has committed a corrupt or
fraudulent act; or
f. the Arbitral Award was obtained by fraud.
