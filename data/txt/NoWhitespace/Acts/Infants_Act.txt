Infants Act
[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 223
Part 1 — Duties and Obligations of Public Guardian and Trustee
Definition
1
In this Act,
"court"
means the Supreme Court.
Public Guardian and Trustee may apply to court
2
(1)
The Public Guardian and Trustee may petition the court on behalf of
infants who possess or are entitled to land in British Columbia for an
order to dispose of all or part of the land.
(2)
The court may proceed in a summary manner on affidavits to inquire
into the merits of the application.
(3)
The court may order that a disposition of the land be made by the
Public Guardian and Trustee in the manner and with the restrictions
the court believes appropriate if the court
(a)
is of the opinion that the disposition is expedient, necessary or
proper in the interests of the infant or for the infant's maintenance
or education, or
(b)
is satisfied that part of the land is wasting, dilapidating or
depreciating from any cause and the infant's interest requires the
disposition or will be substantially promoted by the disposition.
Contents of petition
3
(1)
The petition must state
(a)
the nature and amount of property, other than land, if any, to which
the infant is entitled, and
(b)
the necessity for resorting to the land, its nature, value, and the
annual net revenue from it.
(2)
The petition must
(a)
designate the land proposed to be disposed of,
(b)
propose a scheme for that purpose and for the disposition of the
proceeds, and
(c)
state specifically the relief desired and circumstances sufficient to
justify the disposition of the land and the proposed application of
the proceeds.
Transfer
4
(1)
Each disposition made by the Public Guardian and Trustee under an
order made under section 2 (3) is as effectual as if the infant had
executed it and had been of the age of 19 years at the time.
(2)
It is not necessary in the transfer to recite any part of the
proceedings, but the transfer must briefly refer to the order.
Application of proceeds
5
The money arising from the disposition must be applied and disposed of
in a manner the court directs.
Disposition not to change rights
6
(1)
A disposition does not give to the infant any other or greater
interest in the proceeds of the disposition than the infant had in the
property disposed of.
(2)
The heirs, next of kin, or other representatives of the infant have
the same interest in any surplus of the proceeds that remains at the
death of the infant as they would have had in the land disposed of as
if the disposition had not been made.
Procedure if property is subject to encumbrance
7
(1)
If land of an infant is subject to an uncertain encumbrance, and the
person entitled to the encumbrance consents in writing to accept in
place of the encumbrance a sum of money that the court thinks
reasonable, or the permanent investment of a reasonable sum of money
in a manner that the interest is made payable to the person entitled
to the encumbrance during the person's life, the court may direct
payment of the sum or the investment of the other sum of money out of
the proceeds of the disposition of the land.
(2)
If land of an infant is subject to a lien or encumbrance of uncertain
duration, the court may
(a)
compute its reasonable value,
(b)
order a disposition of the land of the infant discharged from the lien
or encumbrance, and
(c)
direct the payment of the value of the lien or encumbrance out of the
proceeds of the disposition.
Power to prevent sales of land to prejudice of infants
8
(1)
If it appears to the Public Guardian and Trustee that there are
grounds for believing that a disposition of land in which an infant is
interested is being made or is about to be made by a personal
representative or other person to the prejudice of the infant, the
Public Guardian and Trustee may lodge a caveat with the proper
registrar of titles prohibiting any dealing with or registration
affecting the land until
(a)
an order of the court is obtained approving of the disposition, or
(b)
the caveat is withdrawn or otherwise discharged.
(2)
The Public Guardian and Trustee may
(a)
take the steps the Public Guardian and Trustee considers necessary to
protect the infant, and
(b)
attend at a hearing before the court.
(3)
On the application of the Public Guardian and Trustee, the court may
make the order considered necessary to protect the interests of the
infant.
Disabled plaintiff
9
If a notice to proceed has been delivered to the Public Guardian and
Trustee under section 20 or 26 of the
Limitation Act
and it appears to the Public Guardian and Trustee that the guardian to
whom that notice was delivered is failing to take reasonable steps to
protect the interests of the disabled plaintiff or is otherwise acting
to the prejudice of the disabled plaintiff, the Public Guardian and
Trustee must
(a)
investigate the circumstances stated in the notice and out of which
the claim may arise or be claimed to arise, and
(b)
commence and maintain a proceeding for the benefit of the disabled
plaintiff if the Public Guardian and Trustee believes that the
proceeding would have a reasonable prospect of succeeding and would
result in a judgment that would justify commencing it.
Costs of proceedings by Public Guardian and Trustee
10
The court may direct that the costs of
(a)
a proceeding commenced by the Public Guardian and Trustee, or
(b)
a proceeding in which it is necessary or expedient for the Public
Guardian and Trustee to attend
be taxed and paid either out of the estate of the infant or by any
other person who is a party to the proceeding.

the Public Guardian and Trustee's account, exercise for the benefit of
the infant the powers conferred on trustees by section 24 of the
Trustee Act
and, without obtaining leave of the court, by section 25 of that
Act.

term of years, the infant or the infant's guardian in the infant's
name, by the direction of the court by order made on a summary

to be for the person's benefit that a lease be made of the property
for a term of years, to encourage the erection of buildings on the
land, to repair buildings on it, to work mines, or to otherwise
improve the land, or for farming or other purposes, the infant or the
infant's guardian in the infant's name, by the order of the court made
on a summary application of the infant or the infant's guardian, may
lease the land or a part of it, to the extent of the infant's interest
in it, for the term and subject to the rents and covenants the court

Renewal of leases if person bound to renew out of jurisdiction
37
(1)
If a person who, under a covenant or agreement in writing, if within
the jurisdiction and subject to the process of the court, might be
compelled to execute a renewal of a lease, is not within the
jurisdiction or not amenable to the court's process, the court, by
order made on the petition of a person entitled to the renewal,
whether or not the person is under disability, may direct a person the
court thinks proper to accept a surrender of the subsisting lease, and
make a new lease in the name of the person who ought to have renewed
it.
(2)
The court, in its discretion, in the circumstances, may direct an
action be brought to establish the right of the party seeking the
renewal before an order for a new lease is made.

as if it were made by the person named and the person had been alive
and not under any disability.

agreement, unless the fine, if any, and the things, if any, as ought
to be paid or performed by the lessee are first paid and performed.
Renewal: if money to go
39
All money received for a lease renewal, after deduction of necessary
incidental charges and expenses, must be paid,
