Property tax assessed by the authority
25

Assessment Act
;
"land"

Assessment Act
.
(2)
The authority
(a)
may, by bylaw, assess a tax within the parameters established by its
strategic plan on the net taxable value of land and improvements in
the transportation service region, other than land and improvements
that are taxable for school purposes only by special Act, and
(b)
must, in assessing that tax, adopt a variable tax rate system in which
individual tax rates are determined and imposed for each property
class.
(2.1)
Despite subsections (2) and (6), if the authority assesses a tax under
those subsections for a taxation year, the authority, instead of
assessing the tax in the treaty lands of a taxing treaty first nation,
by bylaw, must apply the applicable tax rates under those subsections
to the net taxable value of land and improvements in those treaty
lands to determine the amount that would have been assessed in
relation to those treaty lands if the authority were levying a tax in
those treaty lands.
(3) and (4)
[Repealed 2007-41-48.]
(5)
On or before May 1 of each year, the authority must send to

(a)
is applicable only to that increase, and
(b)
has, as the relationship between the tax rate on a property class
other than property class 1 and the tax rate for property class 1, a
relationship that is the same or lower than the relationship between
those same tax rates in the variable tax rate system prescribed for
regional hospital districts under section 27 of the
Hospital District Act
.

(a)
is applicable only to that decrease, and
(b)
has, as the relationship between the tax rate on a property class
other than property class 1 and the tax rate for property class 1, a
relationship that is the same or higher than the relationship between

regional hospital districts under section 27 of the
Hospital District Act
.
(7)
In a bylaw under subsection (2), the authority may
(a)
establish zones in the transportation service region, and
(b)
adopt different tax rates for land and improvements in different zones
based on the benefit that the authority considers accrues to the land
and improvements in a zone as a result of proximity to a
transportation station, or to another major transportation facility,
that has been constructed or funded by the authority.
(7.1)
For any fiscal year after 2007, in addition to the property taxes that
the authority is authorized under this Act, other than this
subsection, to assess in that fiscal year, the authority may, by
bylaw, assess a tax under this subsection on the net taxable value of
land and improvements in the transportation service region if
(a)
the additional tax generates property tax revenue that is not more
than $18 million in that fiscal year, and
(b)
the additional tax is collected only from property classes 1, 2, 4, 5
and 6 in whatever proportions the authority may determine.
(7.2)
Despite subsection (7.1), if a tax is assessed under that subsection,
the amount that would have been assessed in relation to the treaty
lands of a taxing treaty first nation if the authority were levying a
tax on the net taxable value of land and improvements in those treaty
lands must be recovered from the treaty first nation by sending the
treaty first nation a requisition for that amount under subsection (5)
(b).
(8)
[Repealed 2003-3-12.]
(9)
If required by the authority, the British Columbia Assessment
Authority must certify and forward to the authority the net taxable
values of land and improvements, for the current year, in respect of
which tax may be assessed under this section in
(a)
a municipality,

the treaty lands of a taxing treaty first nation
in the transportation service region.

of the taxes that are assessed on the taxable parking area of, or on
the taxable parking spaces in, parking sites located in the
municipality, and the Surveyor of Taxes must collect those of the
taxes that are assessed on the taxable parking area of, or on the
taxable parking spaces in, parking sites located in any rural area,
and, in this subsection,
"parking site"
,
"taxable parking area"

against the real property of
(i)
the person,
(ii)
an associated corporation of the person, or

a related individual of the person
by registering a certificate of lien in the prescribed form in the

against the personal property of
(i)
the person,

unpaid, uncollected or unremitted and any related penalty or interest
on that amount.

On registration of a lien against the personal property of a person
under subsection (2) (b), a lien is created on the personal property

If a lien results from an estimate under section 169.29 and the
estimate is for an amount that is different from the actual amount of
the lien as established under subsections (3) and (4) of this section,
the administrator may correct the amount by registering a new lien in
the revised amount and discharging the original lien, but the new
registration is deemed to be registered at the same time as the
registration it revises.

by the written consent of a named person, the administrator must
disclose in writing whether a lien is registered against the personal
or real property of the named person and, if a lien is registered, the
amount of the lien and the date of its registration.

(Canada), the administrator may request one or both of the
corporations to provide to the administrator the records and
information required by the administrator to confirm or rebut that
belief.
(8)
The administrator may determine that the corporations are associated
corporations for the purposes of this section if
(a)
a corporation that has been requested to provide records or
information to the administrator under subsection (7) fails or refuses
to comply with that request within a period of time considered by the
administrator to be reasonable in the circumstances, or

the records or information provided to the administrator under this

may register a lien under this section against the real and personal
property of the corporation.

registered under subsection (9) at any time after the registration of

until the later of

the date that is 90 days after the date on which the notice required
under subsection (9) (a) was sent to the corporation, and
(b)
if a notice of appeal is served on the chief executive officer in
respect of the determination within the time provided by section
169.39 (2), the date on which the chief executive officer upholds the
determination under that appeal.
(11)
If, at any time, the administrator becomes convinced that the
corporations were not associated within the meaning of the section 256
of the
Income Tax Act
(Canada) at the time that the lien was registered under subsection (9)
(b) of this section or if the chief executive officer or a court of
competent jurisdiction upholds the corporation's appeal against the
administrator's determination on the basis that the corporations were
not associated at the time that the lien was registered, the
administrator must,
(a)
if the administrator has not realized on any of the assets against
which the lien was registered, promptly release the lien, and
(b)
if the administrator has realized on some or all of the assets against
which the lien was registered, promptly release the lien against the
remaining assets and pay the proceeds realized from the sale of the
realized assets minus any costs or expenses incurred in the sale
(i)
to the corporation, or
(ii)
if the administrator considers it appropriate to do so, into the
Supreme Court under Rule 10-3 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules.
(12)
The release of the lien under subsection (11) (a) or the release of
the lien and payment of the applicable net sale proceeds under
subsection (11) (b) is deemed to be full satisfaction of all claims
any person, including the corporation, might have arising out of or in
any way connected with the determination made under subsection (8),
the registration of the lien or the seizure or sale of any or all of
the assets against which the lien was registered.
