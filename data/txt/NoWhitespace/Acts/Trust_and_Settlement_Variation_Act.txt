or contingent, under the trusts who by reason of infancy or other
incapacity is incapable of assenting,

any person, whether ascertained or not, who may become entitled,
directly or indirectly, to an interest under the trusts as being at a
future date or on the happening of a future event a person of a
specified description or a member of a specified class of persons,
(c)
any person unborn, or
(d)
any person in respect of an interest of the person that may arise by
reason of a discretionary power given to anyone on the failure or
determination of an existing interest that has not failed or
determined,
any arrangement proposed by any person, whether or not there is any
other person beneficially interested who is capable of assenting to
it, varying or revoking all or any of the trusts or enlarging the
powers of the trustees of managing or administering any of the
property subject to the trusts.
