Law and Equity Act
[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 253
Application of Act
1
The rules of law enacted and declared by this Act are part of the law
of British Columbia and must be applied in all courts in British
Columbia.
Application of English law in British Columbia
2
Subject to section 3, the Civil and Criminal Laws of England, as they
existed on November 19, 1858, so far as they are not from
local circumstances inapplicable, are in force in British Columbia,
but those laws must be held to be modified and altered by all
legislation that has the force of law in British Columbia or in any
former Colony comprised within its geographical limits.
Laws not in force in British Columbia
3
Section 28 of the
Offences Against the Person Act, 1828
and all sections of the
Real Property Act, 1845
are not in force in British Columbia.
Equitable relief for plaintiff
4
If a plaintiff or petitioner claims to be entitled to an equitable
estate or right or to relief on an equitable ground against a deed,
instrument or contract, or against any right, title or claim asserted
by a defendant or respondent in a cause or matter, or to relief
founded on a legal right that, before April 29, 1879, could
only have been given by the court as a court of equity, the court,
either as a court of law or equity, and every judge of it, must give
the plaintiff or petitioner the relief that ought to have been given
by the court in a suit or proceeding in equity for the same or similar
purpose properly commenced before April 29, 1879.
Equitable relief for defendant
5
If a defendant claims to be entitled to an equitable estate or right
or to relief on an equitable ground against a deed, instrument or
contract, or against any right, title or claim asserted by a plaintiff
or petitioner in a cause or matter, or alleges an equitable defence to
a claim of the plaintiff or petitioner in the cause or matter, the
court, whether as a court of law or equity, and every judge of it,
must give to every equitable estate, right or ground of relief
claimed, and to every equitable defence alleged, the effect by way of
defence against the claim of the plaintiff or petitioner, that the
court ought to have given if the same or similar matters had been
relied on as a defence in a suit or proceeding commenced in that court
as a court of equity for the same or similar purpose before
April 29, 1879.
Repealed
6
[Repealed 1998-42-25.]
Judicial notice of equitable estates
7
The court, and every judge of it, must recognize and take notice of
all equitable estates, titles and rights and all equitable duties and
liabilities appearing incidentally in the course of a cause or matter
in the same manner in which the court sitting in equity would have
recognized and taken notice of those estates, titles, rights, duties
and liabilities in any suit or proceeding properly commenced in that
court before April 29, 1879.
No restraint by prohibition or injunction
8
(1)
A cause or proceeding pending in the court must not be restrained by
prohibition or injunction, but every matter of equity on which an
injunction against the prosecution of that cause or proceeding might
have been obtained before April 29, 1879, either
conditionally or unconditionally, may be relied on by way of defence.
(2)
Nothing in this Act disables the court from directing a stay of
proceedings in a cause or matter pending before it, if it thinks fit.
(3)
Any person, whether or not a party to a cause or matter pending before
the court, who would have been entitled, but for this Act, to apply to
the court to restrain the prosecution of it, or who may be entitled to
enforce, by attachment or otherwise, any judgment, decree, rule or
order, contrary to which all or any part of the proceedings in the
cause or matter may have been taken, may apply to the court, by motion
in a summary way, for a stay of proceedings in the cause or matter,
either generally or so far as may be necessary for the purposes of
justice and the court must make any order that is just.
Judicial notice of legal and statutory rights, claims and liabilities
9
Subject to this Act, the court and every judge of it must recognize
and give effect to all legal claims and demands and all estates,
titles, rights, duties, obligations and liabilities existing by the
common law or by any custom or created by any statute, in the same
manner as they would have been recognized and given effect to in the
court if this Act had not been enacted.
Avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings
10
In the exercise of its jurisdiction in a cause or matter before it,
the court must grant, either absolutely or on reasonable conditions
that to it seem just, all remedies that any of the parties may appear
to be entitled to in respect of any legal or equitable claim properly
brought forward by them in the cause or matter so that, as far as
possible, all matters in controversy between the parties may be
completely and finally determined and all multiplicity of legal
proceedings concerning any of those matters may be avoided.
Equitable waste
11
An estate for life without impeachment of waste does not confer and is
deemed not to have conferred on the tenant for life a legal right to
commit equitable waste, unless an intention to confer that right
expressly appears by the instrument creating the estate.
Merger
12
There is not any merger, by operation of law only, of an estate the
beneficial interest in which would not be deemed to be merged or
extinguished in equity.
Mortgagor may sue in respect of mortgaged land
13
A mortgagor entitled to the possession or receipt of the rents and
profits of land, as to which a notice of the mortgagee's intention to
take possession or to enter into the receipt of those rents and
profits has not been given by the mortgagee, may sue for possession or
for the recovery of the rents or profits, or to prevent or recover
damages in respect of a trespass or other wrong relative to the land,
in the mortgagor's own name only, unless the cause of action arises on
a lease or other contract made by the mortgagor jointly with another
person.
Mortgagor may require mortgagee to assign
14
(1)
Despite any stipulation to the contrary, if a mortgagor is entitled to
redeem, the mortgagor may require the mortgagee, or the mortgagee's
personal representatives or assigns, instead of giving a certificate
of payment or reconveying, and on the terms on which the mortgagee
would be bound to reconvey, to assign the mortgage debt and convey the
mortgaged property to any third person as the mortgagor directs and
the mortgagee is bound to assign and convey accordingly.
(2)
A mortgagee in possession who is required to assign, transfer and
convey under subsection (1) does not incur any legal liability that
the mortgagee would not have incurred if the mortgagee had executed a
release of the mortgage.
Order for sale
15
The court may, before or after judgment in a proceeding
(a)
by a mortgagee, for the foreclosure of the equity of redemption in
mortgaged property, or
(b)
by a vendor of land, where a claim for the cancellation of the
agreement is made, with or without a claim for the forfeiture of money
paid on account of the purchase price,
on the application of a person who has an interest in the property or
land, direct a sale of the property or land on the terms the court
considers just.
Agreements for sale
16
(1)
In this section:
"agreement for sale"
means a contract for the sale of an interest in land under which the
purchaser agrees to pay the purchase price over a period of time, in
the manner stated in the contract, and on payment of which the vendor
is obliged to convey the interest in land to the purchaser, but does
not include a contract under which
(a)
the purchase price is payable in less than 6 months from the time
the contract is entered into, and
(b)
the purchaser is not, during the 6 month period, entitled to
possession of the land that is the subject matter of the contract;
"foreclosure"
means a proceeding, commenced by a vendor under an agreement for sale,
in which the relief claimed is an order for one or more of the
following:
(a)
specific performance of the agreement;
(b)
cancellation of the agreement;
(c)
determination of the agreement;
"redemption"
means the payment, fulfillment or performance by the purchaser or
person claiming through the purchaser, of all obligations secured by
the property and, if there has been a breach or default of the
purchaser or person claiming through the purchaser, by payment of
(a)
all expenses or disbursements reasonably made or incurred by the
vendor in respect of the property, including taxes, repairs and
payments in respect of other encumbrances, and
(b)
reasonable compensation for costs incurred by the vendor in bringing a
proceeding or seeking to enforce the obligations of the purchaser
to the extent provided for in the agreement for sale or in the Supreme
Court Civil Rules.
(2)
If, in a foreclosure, the purchaser or person claiming through the
purchaser is given time to redeem, the court must order that the time
for redemption be 6 months, unless the court considers, in the
circumstances, that a shorter or longer period is justified.
(3)
The court may, before making an order absolute in a foreclosure,
extend the redemption period ordered under subsection (2).
(4)
A proceeding by a vendor to enforce a personal covenant in an
agreement for sale, taken after entry of an order nisi in a
foreclosure, does not affect the right of the vendor to obtain an
order absolute in the foreclosure.
(5)
Despite section 32 of the
Property Law Act
, or the making of an order absolute in any foreclosure brought on an
agreement for sale, the court has the same discretion to reopen the
foreclosure and allow the purchaser to redeem as it would have had if
the foreclosure had been brought to enforce a mortgage.
(6)
Despite any term or provision of an agreement for sale to the
contrary, a vendor may only cancel, rescind or otherwise determine an
agreement for sale by obtaining an order to that effect in a
foreclosure.
Power of court to discharge mortgagor on payment of mortgage money
17
Where an action is brought on a bond for payment of the money secured
by a mortgage or performance of its covenants or where an action of
ejectment is brought by a mortgagee or a mortgagee's heirs, personal
representatives or assigns for the recovery of the possession of
mortgaged land, and no suit is pending concerning the foreclosing or
redeeming of the mortgaged land, if the person who has the right to
redeem the mortgaged land appears and becomes a defendant in the
action and at any time, pending the action, pays to the mortgagee or,
in the case of the mortgagee's refusal, brings into court where the
action is pending all the principal money and interest due on the
mortgage, and all costs spent in any proceeding on the mortgage, the
money for principal, interest and costs to be calculated by the court,
the money so paid to the mortgagee or brought into court is in full
satisfaction and discharge of the mortgage, and the court must and may
discharge the mortgagor or defendant from the mortgage accordingly and
must and may, by the rules of the court, compel the mortgagee, at the
expense of the mortgagor, to assign, surrender or reconvey the
mortgaged land and the estate and interest that the mortgagee has in
it, and deliver up all deeds, evidences and writings in the
mortgagee's custody relating to the title of the mortgaged land to the
mortgagor who has paid or brought the money into the court, the
mortgagor's heirs, personal representatives or to the person the
mortgagor appoints for that purpose.
Power of court in foreclosure actions to make order without regular
hearing
18
(1)
If a proceeding is brought by a person who has or claims an estate,
right or interest in land under a mortgage of the land, to compel the
defendant in the proceeding, who claims a right to redeem, to pay the
plaintiff in the proceeding the principal money and interest due on
the mortgage or the principal money and interest due on the mortgage
together with any money due on an encumbrance or specialty, charged or
chargeable on the equity of redemption, and in default of payment to
foreclose the defendant of the right to redeem the mortgaged land, the
court, on application made to it by the defendant with a right to
redeem the mortgaged land and on the defendant admitting the right and
title of the plaintiff, may and must at any time before the hearing
make an order or give a judgment that the court could have made if the
proceeding had been regularly brought to a hearing or trial.
(2)
All parties to the action are bound by the order or judgment referred
to in subsection (1), as if it were made or given by the court at
the hearing or trial of the proceeding.
Payment of interest after default
19
In a proceeding for the foreclosure of the equity of redemption in
mortgaged property, the court must, unless exceptional circumstances
exist, order that the payment of interest is to be calculated and
payable to the date full payment is made to redeem the property.
Cost in foreclosure proceedings
20
(1)
In this section:
"foreclosure"
, in respect of an agreement for sale, as defined in section 16 (1),
means a foreclosure as defined in that section;
"mortgage"
includes an agreement for sale as defined in section 16 (1).
(2)
In a foreclosure in which costs are awarded, the court may,
(a)
despite any covenant or term of a mortgage respecting the payment and
calculation or manner of determining costs and expenses in, arising
out of, or in connection with a foreclosure, and
(b)
instead of making an order in accordance with that covenant or term,
order that costs be assessed as party and party costs or as special
costs under the Supreme Court Civil Rules, and the court may make no
order for costs if it would otherwise make no order but for the
covenant or term referred to in this subsection.
(3)
This section applies to all proceedings commenced before
April 14, 1986 other than a proceeding in which a court has made
an order for costs.
Venue in foreclosure proceedings
21
(1)
In this section:
"foreclosure"
(a)
does not include a proceeding to enforce or realize a security under a
debenture if that security is land, and
(b)
in respect of an agreement for sale, as defined in section 16 (1),
means a foreclosure as defined in that section;
"mortgage"
includes an agreement for sale as defined in section 16 (1).
(2)
Unless the court otherwise orders, every foreclosure proceeding on a
mortgage must be commenced,
(a)
if the land that is the subject of the foreclosure proceeding is
located in a municipality and there is a registry of the Supreme Court
located in that municipality, at that registry, or
(b)
if the land that is the subject of the foreclosure proceeding is not
located in a municipality or, if it is located in a municipality but
there is no registry of the Supreme Court located in that
municipality, at any registry located in the judicial district in
which the land is located,
and all applications in the proceedings must, subject to the Supreme
Court Civil Rules, be heard at the location of that registry.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), the Vancouver and New Westminster
registries are deemed to be the same registry.
(4)
If the subject of a foreclosure proceeding is more than one parcel of
land, each of which may be closer to different registries of the
Supreme Court, the party commencing the proceeding has the right to
decide in which of those registries to commence the proceeding.
(5)
This section does not apply if, after an allegation of a default under
the mortgage, the person proposing to commence the foreclosure
proceeding agrees with the registered owner of the land that is to be
the subject of the proceeding, that the proceeding may be commenced at
a registry other than the registry referred to in subsection (2) or
(4).
Right of redemption controverted
22
This section and sections 17 and 18 do not extend to a case where the
person against whom the redemption is requested insists, in writing
personally or by the person's attorney, agent or solicitor, delivered
to the solicitor for the other side before the money is brought into
the court, either that the party requesting a redemption does not have
a right to redeem, or that the land is chargeable with other or
different principal sums than those that appear on the face of the
mortgage or are admitted on the other side, or to a case where the
right of redemption to the mortgaged land is controverted or
questioned by or between different defendants in the same proceeding
and do not prejudice a subsequent mortgagee or encumbrancer, despite
anything in sections 17 and 18 to the contrary.
Covenants to insure against fire
23
The person entitled to the benefit of a covenant on the part of a
lessee or mortgagor to insure against loss or damage by fire, on loss
or damage by fire, has the same advantage from any then subsisting
insurance relating to the building covenanted to be insured, effected
by the lessee or mortgagor in respect of the lessee's or mortgagor's
interest under the lease or in the property, or by any person claiming
under the lessee or mortgagor but not effected in conformity with the
covenant, as the person would have from an insurance effected in
conformity with the covenant.
Relief against penalties and forfeitures
24
The court may relieve against all penalties and forfeitures, and in
granting the relief may impose any terms as to costs, expenses,
damages, compensations and all other matters that the court thinks
fit.
Relief against acceleration provisions
25
(1)
Despite an agreement to the contrary, if because of a default in
payment of any money due under, or in the observance of a covenant
contained in
(a)
a mortgage of land, or
(b)
an agreement for sale of land,
the payment of money or the doing of anything is or may be required at
an earlier time than would be the case if the default had not
occurred, then, in a proceeding for the enforcement of rights under
the instrument, the court may, before a final disposition of the
proceeding, relieve any person from the consequence of the default.
(2)
In granting relief under subsection (1), the court may impose any
terms as to costs, expenses, damages, compensations and all other
matters that it considers appropriate.
(3)
This section applies to an instrument referred to in subsection (1)
(a) or (b) made before or after the coming into force of this section,
and to proceedings commenced before or after the coming into force of
this section.
(4)
Section 28 does not apply in an application for relief under this
section.
Relief against forfeiture for breach of covenant to insure
26
The court or any judge of it may, on terms the court or judge may
think fit, relieve against a forfeiture for breach of a covenant or
condition to insure against loss or damage by fire if no loss or
damage by fire has happened and the breach has, in the opinion of the
court, been committed through accident, mistake or otherwise without
fraud or gross negligence, and there is an insurance on foot at the
time of the application to the court or judge that conforms with the
covenant to insure.
Relief to be recorded
27
The court or a judge of it, if relief is granted, must direct that a
record of the relief granted be made by endorsement on the lease or
otherwise.
Single relief on covenant
28
The court or judge does not have power under this Act to relieve the
same person more than once in respect of the same covenant or
condition, nor does it have power to grant any relief under this Act
if a forfeiture under the covenant in respect of which relief is
sought has been already waived out of court in favour of the person
seeking the relief.
Restriction on effect of licence
29
(1)
If a licence to do an act which without that licence would create a
forfeiture, or give a right to re-enter, under a condition or power
reserved in a lease has at any time after March 25, 1881, been
given or is given to any lessee or the lessee's assigns, the licence,
unless otherwise expressed, extends only to the permission actually
given, or to a specific breach of a proviso or covenant made or to be
made, or to the actual assignment, underlease or other matter
specially authorized to be done, but not so as to prevent a proceeding
for a subsequent breach, unless otherwise specified in the licence.
(2)
All rights under covenants and powers of forfeiture and re-entry in
the lease remain in full force and are available against a subsequent
breach of covenant or condition, assignment, underlease or other
matter not specially authorized or made unpunishable by the licence,
in the same manner as if no licence had been given.
(3)
The condition or right of re-entry is and remains in all respects as
if the licence had not been given, except for the particular matter
authorized to be done.
Assignment of personalty
30
Any person may assign personal property, now by law assignable,
including chattels real, directly to themselves and another person, by
the same means as the person might assign the property to another
person.
Stipulations not of essence
31
Stipulations in contracts, as to time or otherwise, that are not
deemed to be or to have become of the essence of the contracts
according to the rules of equity, must receive the same construction
and effect as they would receive in equity.
Damage by collision at sea
32
In any cause or proceeding, other than in the Federal Court of Canada,
for damages arising out of a collision between 2 ships, if both ships
are found to have been in fault, the rules in force in the Federal
Court, so far as they are at variance with the rules of the common
law, prevail.
Custody of infants
33
In questions relating to the custody and education of infants, the
rules of equity prevail.
Surety who discharges liability entitled to assignment of securities
34
(1)
Every person who, being surety for the debt or duty of another or
being liable with another for any debt or duty, pays the debt or
performs the duty is entitled to have assigned to the person or to a
trustee for the person every judgment, specialty or other security
that is held by the creditor in respect of the debt or duty, whether
the judgment, specialty or other security is or is not deemed at law
to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of
the duty.
(2)
The person who has paid the debt or performed the duty is entitled to
stand in the place of the creditor and to use all the remedies and, if
necessary and on a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor
in any action or other proceeding at law or in equity, in order to
obtain from the principal debtor, or a co-surety, co-contractor or
co-debtor indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by
the person, and the payment or performance made by the surety is not
pleadable in bar of any action or other proceeding by the surety.
(3)
A co-surety, co-contractor or co-debtor is not entitled to recover
from any other co-surety, co-contractor or co-debtor, by the means
referred to in subsections (1) and (2), more than the just proportion
to which, as between those parties themselves, the other co-surety,
co-contractor or co-debtor is justly liable.
Writ of execution to bind goods only from time of seizure
35
(1)
In this section,
"writ of execution"
includes an order for seizure and sale issued under the Small Claims
Rules.
(2)
A writ of execution or writ of attachment against the goods of a
debtor does not prejudice the title to the goods acquired by any
person in good faith and for valuable consideration before the actual
seizure or attachment under the writ if the person, at the time when
the person acquired the title, had no notice that the writ, or any
other writ under which the goods of the owner might be seized or
attached, had been delivered to and remained unexecuted in the hands
of the sheriff or other officer entrusted and charged with the
carrying out of the writ of execution.
Assignment of debts and choses in action
36
(1)
An absolute assignment, in writing signed by the assignor, not
purporting to be by way of charge only, of a debt or other legal chose
in action, of which express notice in writing has been given to the
debtor, trustee or other person from whom the assignor would have been
entitled to receive or claim the debt or chose in action, is and is
deemed to have been effectual in law, subject to all equities that
would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee if
this Act had not been enacted, to pass and transfer the legal right to
the debt or chose in action from the date of the notice, and all legal
and other remedies for the debt or chose in action, and the power to
give a good discharge for the debt or chose in action, without the
concurrence of the assignor.
(2)
If the debtor, trustee or other person liable in respect of the debt
or chose in action has had notice that the assignment is disputed by
the assignor or anyone claiming under the assignor, or of any other
opposing or conflicting claims to the debt or chose in action, the
debtor, trustee or other person
(a)
is entitled to call on the persons making the claim to interplead
concerning the debt or chose in action, or
(b)
may pay the debt or chose in action into court, under and in
conformity with the
Trustee Act
.
Vesting orders
37
(1)
Where the court has authority to order the execution of a deed,
conveyance, contract, transfer or assignment of any property or other
document or to endorse any negotiable instrument, the court may, by
order, vest the property in the person and in the manner and for the
estates, as would be done by that deed, conveyance, contract,
assignment or transfer if it were executed.
(2)
An order made under subsection (1) has the same effect as if the legal
or other estate or interest in the property had been actually conveyed
by deed or otherwise for the same estate or interest to the person in
whom it is ordered to be vested or, in the case of a chose in action,
as if the chose in action had been actually assigned to that person.
Execution of instruments by order of court
38
(1)
If any person neglects or refuses to comply with a judgment or order
directing the person to execute any conveyance, contract or document
or to endorse any negotiable instrument, the court may, on terms and
conditions as may be just, order that the deed, conveyance, contract,
assignment or other document must be executed or that the negotiable
instrument must be endorsed by a person the court may nominate for
that purpose.
(2)
If an order is made under subsection (1), the conveyance, contract,
document or instrument executed or endorsed operates and is for all
purposes available as if it had been executed or endorsed by the
person originally directed to execute or endorse it.
Injunction or mandamus may be granted or receiver appointed by
interlocutory order
39
(1)
An injunction or an order in the nature of mandamus may be granted or
a receiver or receiver manager appointed by an interlocutory order of
the court in all cases in which it appears to the court to be just or
convenient that the order should be made.
(2)
An order made under subsection (1) may be made either unconditionally
or on terms and conditions the court thinks just.
(3)
If an injunction is requested either before, at or after the hearing
of a cause or matter, to prevent any threatened or apprehended waste
or trespass, the injunction may be granted if the court thinks fit,
whether the person against whom the injunction is sought is or is not
in possession under any claim of title or otherwise or, if out of
possession, does or does not claim a right to do the act sought to be
restrained under any colour of title, and whether the estates claimed
by both or by either of the parties are legal or equitable.
Railway company not to be restrained on application made without
notice
40
If the application is made without notice, a restraining order or
injunction must not be granted on tan application of a plaintiff or
defendant against a railway company constructing or operating a
railway in British Columbia, by which the work of actual construction
or operation of the line of railway or any part of it will or may be
impeded or delayed, unless it is reasonably apparent that some
irreparable damage will ensue.
Railway company may be ordered to pay money into court
41
On an application for a restraining order or injunction under
section 40, if it is considered by the judge, on the hearing of
the application, that the case is a proper one for the granting of a
restraining order or injunction, the judge may, in place of granting
it, order the railway company intended to be enjoined to pay into
court a sum of money that will, in the judge's opinion, be sufficient
to compensate the applicant for the injunction against all loss,
damage and costs that may be sustained by the applicant because of the
works or other acts complained of.
Applicant for injunction to furnish security
42
(1)
On the hearing of any application under section 40, the judge
may, as a term of the granting of the restraining order or injunction
or of the payment of the money into court, direct the applicant to
give security, to the satisfaction of the registrar of the Supreme
Court, sufficient to indemnify the railway company to be enjoined from
any loss, damage or costs that it may sustain because of the
injunction, or on account of the circumstances under which the payment
into court is directed.
(2)
The judge may order further security to be given.
Rule in
Cumber v. Wane
abrogated
43
Part performance of an obligation either before or after a breach of
it, when expressly accepted by the creditor in satisfaction or
rendered under an agreement for that purpose, though without any new
consideration, must be held to extinguish the obligation.
If rules of equity and law conflict, equity prevails
44
Generally in all matters not particularly mentioned in this Act in
which there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity
and the rules of the common law with reference to the same matter, the
rules of equity prevail.
Uncertain terms in specified leases
45
(1)
A rule of law that a lease, grant, demise or agreement is void because
its term is uncertain does not apply, and is deemed never to have
applied,
(a)
to a mining, petroleum or natural gas lease or, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to a lease, grant, demise or agreement
leasing a Crown granted mineral claim or other mining or mineral
property, or granting the right to use and occupy that property, and
on, in or from it to prospect for, explore, mine, win, work, mill,
make merchantable, carry away or dispose of metals, ores, minerals,
petroleum or natural gas or to use the property for any purpose
connected with those purposes, or
(b)
to a lease of the whole or any part of land or a building if that
land, building or part is, or forms or becomes part of, the common
property of a strata corporation or, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, to a lease, grant, demise or agreement granting or
assigning rights in relation to some or all of that land, building or
part.
(2)
Subsection (1) applies to instruments coming into operation before, on
and after April 3, 1947.
Repealed
46
[Repealed 2009-13-234.]
Charitable trusts
47
If a person gives, devises or bequeaths property in trust for a
charitable purpose that is linked conjunctively or disjunctively in
the instrument by which the trust is created with a noncharitable
purpose, and the gift, devise or bequest would be void for uncertainty
or remoteness, the gift, devise or bequest is not invalid as a result
but operates solely for the benefit of the charitable purpose.
Action by claimant under labour and material bonds
48
A claimant under a labour and material bond has a cause of action
against the surety named in the bond if the principal named in the
bond defaults in the principal's obligations under it and may commence
an action against the surety on the claimant's own behalf and on
behalf of other claimants to recover the amount of the claim.
