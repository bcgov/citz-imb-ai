Escheat Act
[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 120
Part 1 — Escheats
Escheated land may be taken by Attorney General
1
If land in British Columbia escheats to the government because the
person last seised or entitled to it dies intestate and without lawful
heirs, or forfeits to the government, the Attorney General may take
possession of the land in the name of the government.
Delegation by Attorney General
1.1
In this Act,
"Attorney General"
in a section includes a person designated by the Attorney General for
purposes of the section.
Action for possession

The Attorney General may sue to recover possession of escheated land.
Escheat of estates
3
(1)
If a person dies without an heir and intestate in respect of any real
estate consisting of any estate or interest, whether legal or
equitable, in any incorporeal hereditament, or of any equitable estate
or interest in any corporeal hereditament, whether devised or not
devised to trustees by the will of that person, the law of escheat
applies in the same manner as if that estate or interest were a legal
estate in corporeal hereditaments.
(2)
If any beneficial interest in the real estate of any deceased person,
whether the estate or interest of the deceased person in it was legal
or equitable, is, because of the failure of the objects of the devise
or other circumstances happening before or after the death of the
deceased person, in whole or in part not effectually disposed of, the
deceased person is deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have
died intestate in respect of that part of the beneficial interest as
is ineffectually disposed of.
Escheat of land on dissolution of corporation
4
(1)
If a corporation is dissolved, land in British Columbia owned by or to
which the corporation is entitled at the time of its dissolution
escheats to the government.
(2)
The law of escheat and the provisions of this Act apply in respect of
that land in the same manner as if a natural person had been last
seised or entitled to it and had died intestate and without lawful
heirs.
(3)
The Attorney General must not, within 2 years from the date of
the dissolution of a corporation, make any grant or other disposition
of land of the corporation which escheats to the government.
(4)
If, within 2 years from the date of its dissolution, a corporation is
revived under any Act, the revival has effect as if the land of the
corporation had not escheated to the government, and, subject to the
terms of any court order, the land vests in the corporation.
(5)
If an application is made to the Supreme Court to revive a corporation
after the expiry of the 2 year period referred to in subsection (4) or
is made in respect of a corporation that has been revived after that
period, the Supreme Court may, if notice of the application has been
served on the government, order that land of the corporation that had
escheated to the government under this section vest in the
corporation.
(5.1)
An order may not be made under subsection (5) if the Attorney General
has granted or otherwise disposed of the land of the corporation that
had escheated to the government.
(6)
Land that is the subject matter of an order made under subsection (5)
vests in the corporation at the time, in the manner and subject to the
conditions set out in the order.
(7)
The Supreme Court must make it a term of any order made under
subsection (5) that the land must not vest in the corporation until
the government has been reimbursed for any costs and expenses
(a)
incurred by the government in relation to the land after it escheated
to the government, and
(b)
for which the government makes application for reimbursement at the
time of the hearing.
(8)
This section applies to real estate of a corporation consisting of any
estate or interest, whether legal or equitable, in any incorporeal
hereditament, or of any equitable estate or interest in any corporeal
hereditament, in the same manner as if that estate or interest were a
legal estate in corporeal hereditaments.

that vested in the government, for the purpose of providing access to
the water system property.

property of the corporation that had vested in the government vests in
the corporation.
