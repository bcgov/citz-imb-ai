)
an intimate image that has been altered, and
(
ii
)
an intimate image in which the individual is not identifiable, and

Distribution without consent and threat of distribution
3
(

consent of the individual, or
(

(

Distribution of an intimate image without the consent of the

)
[Not in force.]
(

)
the distribution is for the purposes of
(

)
a law enforcement investigation,

7
(
1
)
A person in a prescribed class may, in accordance with any
regulations, make an application under section 5 on behalf of a
deceased individual respecting an intimate image in which the
individual is depicted.
(
2
)
In an application made on behalf of a deceased individual, the
decision maker must apply the following presumptions:
(
a
)
that the deceased individual did not consent to the distribution, if
any, of the intimate image;
(
b
)
that the deceased individual would not have made a request under
section 13 (1) (b)
[publication ban]
.
Applications respecting minors and others
8
(
1
)
Subject to any regulations, a minor who has reached the age
prescribed under section 21 (2) (g)
[regulations of the Lieutenant Governor in Council]
may make an application under section 5 to the tribunal respecting
an intimate image in which the minor is depicted.
(
2
)
A person in a prescribed class may, if authorized by the individual
depicted in an intimate image, and in accordance with any
regulations, make an application to the tribunal under
section 5 on behalf of
(
a
)
a minor who is depicted in the intimate image and has reached the
age prescribed under section 21 (2) (i), and
(
b
)
an adult who is depicted in the intimate image.
Burden of proof
9
Under sections 5 and 6, a respondent has the burden of proving that
the image is not an intimate image because the individual depicted
in the image did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
image at the following times, as applicable:
(
a
)
if the image is a recording, at the time it was recorded, and, if
distributed, at the time of the distribution;
(
b
)
if the image is a simultaneous representation, at the time the
simultaneous representation occurred.
Defence to application for expedited intimate image protection order
10
A respondent is not liable under section 5 if the respondent proves
that the respondent had the consent of the individual depicted in
the intimate image to distribute the intimate image, at the time
when and to the extent that the intimate image was distributed by
the respondent.
Defence to claim for damages
11
(
1
)
A respondent is not liable under section 6 if the respondent proves
that, as applicable,
(
a
)
the respondent had, or honestly and reasonably believed that the
respondent had, the consent of the individual depicted in the
intimate image to distribute the intimate image, at the time when
and to the extent that the intimate image was distributed by the
respondent, or
(
b
)
the distribution was in the public interest and did not extend
beyond what was in the public interest.
(
2
)
For certainty, a distribution is not in the public interest solely
because the individual depicted in the intimate image is a public
figure.
Liability of internet intermediaries limited
12
An internet intermediary is not liable under section 5 or 6 if the
internet intermediary has taken reasonable steps to address the
unlawful distribution of intimate images in the use of its services.
Publication ban
13
(
1
)
In an application under section 5, a claim under section 6 or an
application under section 15
[application to Supreme Court for injunctive relief]
, as applicable, the decision maker must order a ban on publication
of the name of the applicant or claimant, as applicable, or other
information likely to identify the applicant or claimant, unless
(
a
)
the applicant or claimant was an adult at the time of the
distribution or threat of distribution,
(
b
)
the applicant or claimant requests that there not be a publication
ban, and
(
c
)
there are no other reasons to protect the identity of the applicant
or claimant.
(
2
)
In an application under section 5 or a claim under section 6, as
applicable, the decision maker must order a ban on publication of
the name of a respondent, or other information likely to identify
the respondent, if
(
a
)
the respondent was a minor at the time of the distribution or threat
of distribution, or
(
b
)
there are other reasons to protect the identity of the respondent.
(
3
)
A publication ban ordered under subsection (1) or (2)
(
a
)
may protect the identities of all of the parties,
(
b
)
must, in the case of an applicant or claimant, as applicable, or
respondent, who was a minor at the time of the distribution or
threat of distribution, and subject to any regulations, continue
once the applicant or claimant or respondent is no longer a minor,
and
(
c
)
may otherwise be in effect for a period of time determined by the
decision maker.
(
4
)
In making a decision under subsection (1) that a publication ban
will not be ordered in a claim under section 6, the decision maker
is not bound by any publication ban ordered in an application under
section 5 arising from the same facts.
(
5
)
An individual who
(
a
)
is an adult and was an applicant or a claimant, or
(
b
)
made an application on behalf of a deceased individual
may, at any time, in accordance with any regulations, ask the
decision maker that ordered the publication ban to cancel the order.
(
6
)
In an application under subsection (5), the decision maker hearing
the application must consider any prescribed factors.
Enforcement of tribunal orders
14
If the tribunal has made an order under section 5 against a
respondent, the order may be filed in the Supreme Court, and the
filed order is enforceable as if it were an order of the Supreme
Court.
Application to Supreme Court for injunctive relief
15
(
1
)
On application by any person, the Supreme Court may grant an
injunction restraining a person from contravening an order made
under section 5 if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that a person has contravened or is likely to
contravene an order made under section 5.
(
2
)
An application under this section may be made without notice.
(
3
)
The Supreme Court may grant an interim injunction until the
disposition of an application under this section.
Part
4
—
Administrative Penalties
Tribunal may order administrative penalty
16
The tribunal may order a person to pay an administrative penalty if
(
a
)
the tribunal determines that the person has failed to comply with an
order made under section 5, and
(
b
)
the person is given an opportunity to be heard in relation to the
administrative penalty before the administrative penalty is ordered.
Amount of administrative penalty
17
An administrative penalty for a failure to comply referred to in
section 16 must not exceed the prescribed amount.
