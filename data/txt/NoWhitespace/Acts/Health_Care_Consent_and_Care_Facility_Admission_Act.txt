How incapability is determined
7

the health care is proposed.

skills and abilities, and

delay is likely to put the adult's life or health at risk.

Subject to section 9 (2), a person chosen under section 16 has the
authority to decide whether to give or refuse substitute consent.

care begins, confirm in writing that
(a)
the adult is still incapable, and
(b)
the person who earlier consented to the health care being provided
confirms that the health care should begin.
(2.1)
Despite subsection (2) and whether or not the health care that is the
subject of the decision made under subsection (1) has begun, if at any
time a health care provider has reasonable grounds to believe that the
adult may be capable of giving or refusing consent to health care, the
health care provider must again determine whether the adult remains
incapable.

before the health care that is the subject of the decision made under

to that health care.
(2.3)
Subsection (2.2) does not invalidate anything that is otherwise
validly done before the decision made under subsection (1) is
rescinded.
(3)
While the authority to give or refuse substitute consent to health
care for the adult is valid, a person chosen under section 16 may
apply to the court under the
Adult Guardianship Act
for an order appointing a personal guardian for the adult.
(4)
If a person chosen under section 16 makes an application under the
Adult Guardianship Act

this Act continues until a final order is made under that Act, unless
that authority is otherwise terminated under this Act.

relieved of the authority to give or refuse substitute consent, the
health care provider may choose in accordance with that section
another person to assume that authority.

section.

person.

any claim of confidentiality or privilege, other than a claim based on
solicitor-client privilege, and

any restriction in an enactment or the common law about the disclosure
or confidentiality of information, other than a restriction in section
51 of the
