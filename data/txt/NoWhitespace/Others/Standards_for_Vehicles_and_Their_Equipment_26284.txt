(i) The gusset plate shall be made of g40.21 - 44t steel plate, or better; (ii) The gusset plate thickness shall not be less than 6.3 mm; (iii) The gusset plate shall be an inverted "u", channel or a welded "l" Section;
(iv) The gusset plate section shall have a horizontal leg length of not Less than 45 cm welded to the bunk bed and a vertical leg length Of not less than 30 cm welded to each side of the stake; (v) The gusset plate shall have a minimum radius of 2.5 cm on all Corners and be provided with smooth transitions between all changes in Section;
(vi) The clear inside dimension of the inverted "u" or channel gusset shall Overlap the stake by not less than 2.5 cm to facilitate the Welded attachment of the gusset vertical leg to both sides of the Stake. attachment of the gusset to the inside face of the stake is not Permitted;
(vii) The welds attaching the steel gusset to the bunk bed and stake shall Be 6.3 mm min. fillet welds (leg sizes); (viii) The weld deposit shall be made using dry e70xx or higher strength low Hydrogen electrodes or, in the case of weld deposits on 100 ksi Yield stakes, using e110xx electrodes; (ix) The fillet welds shall be free of excessive reinforcement overlap, Roughness of weld, undercut, cracks, craters left unfilled, lack of Root and side wall fusion, slag inclusions along the fusion line Surface and porosity; (x) The continuous fillet weld on the vertical leg of the gusset shall Terminate at the top with a 1.9 mm length wrap around horizontally (i.e. no fillet weld across the inner face of the stake). there shall Be no weld across the inner face of the stake; (xi) All faying surfaces between the bunk and stake at the hinge point Shall be joined by fillet welds of not less than 9.5 mm (leg.), and Shims may be used between the bunk ends and stakes to backup for Excessive gaps by welding; (xii) Bunk and stake assemblies manufactured from high strength quench and Tempered steels, such as g40.21-100q, astm-a-54, t-1, or equivalent, Shall be done under controlled conditions by welders qualified by the Ministry of labour as follows:
(a) All weld areas shall be dry, free of deleterious materials such as Mill scale, rust, oil, grease and dirt; (b) All low hydrogen electrode coatings used shall be dry and not be Exposed to the atmosphere for more than one hour after opening the Electrode container; (c) Weld joints are to be preheated to approximately 70°f for 1/4" thick Material. the heat soak is to be throughout the plate thickness and Not surface temperature only; (d) Single pass fillets are to be deposited at fairly rapid arc travel Speeds to ensure that the heat input for the weld is not too high; (e) The fillet weld profile shall preferably be slightly concave, however, Slight convexity is acceptable, providing the toes of the fillet have A smooth transition shape at the juncture to the base metal joined; (f) All welds shall be tested for soundness by magnetic particle test Methods and written certification obtained.
