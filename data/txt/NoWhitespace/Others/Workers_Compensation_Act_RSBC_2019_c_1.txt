Limitation on legal proceedings against employers or workers
127
(1)
Subject to subsection (2),
(a)
the compensation provisions are in place of any right and rights of
action, statutory or otherwise, founded on a breach of duty of care or
any other cause of action, whether that duty or cause of action is
imposed by or arises by reason of law or contract, express or implied,
to which a worker or a dependant or family member of the worker is or
may be entitled against
(i)
the employer of the worker,
(ii)
an employer within the scope of the compensation provisions, or
(iii)
any other worker,
in respect of any personal injury, disablement or death of the worker
arising out of and in the course of employment, and
(b)
no action lies in respect of such an injury, disablement or death.
(2)
Subsection (1) applies only if the action or conduct of
(a)
the employer or the employer's servant or agent, or
(b)
the other worker,
that caused the breach of duty of care arose out of and in the course
of employment within the scope of the compensation provisions.
Worker or dependant may bring action against other persons or elect to
claim compensation under this Act
128
(1)
If the cause of an injury, disablement or death of a worker is such
that an action lies against a person, other than an employer or worker
within the scope of the compensation provisions, the worker or
dependant may
(a)
claim compensation under the compensation provisions, or
(b)
bring an action.
(2)
If a worker or dependant of a worker elects to claim compensation
under subsection (1) (a), the worker or dependant must do so within 3
months of the occurrence of the injury, disablement or death of the
worker or a longer period that the Board allows.
(3)
If the Board is satisfied that
(a)
a worker is unable to exercise the worker's right to elect to claim
compensation under subsection (1) (a) due to the worker's physical or
mental disability, and
(b)
undue hardship will result,
the Board may pay the compensation provided under the compensation
provisions until the worker is able to make an election.
(4)
If, after compensation is paid under subsection (3), the worker then
elects not to claim compensation under subsection (1) (a),
(a)
no further compensation may be paid, and
(b)
the compensation that was paid is a first charge against any amount
recovered.

filed by a parent, a guardian or the Public Guardian and Trustee for
compensation for the child is a valid election on behalf of that
child.
Circumstances where compensation may be paid after action is settled
129
If after trial, or after settlement out of court with the written
approval of the Board, less is recovered and collected than the amount
of the compensation to which a worker or dependant would be entitled
under the compensation provisions, the worker or dependant is entitled
to compensation under those provisions to the extent of the amount of
the difference.
Board has right of action if compensation is claimed
130
(1)
If a worker or dependant applies to the Board claiming compensation
under the compensation provisions, neither the making of the
application nor the payment of compensation under those provisions
restricts or impairs any right of action against the party liable.
(2)
In relation to every claim referred to in subsection (1), the Board is
subrogated to the rights of the worker or dependant and may maintain
an action in the name of the worker or dependant or in the name of the
Board.
(3)
The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether to maintain
an action under this section or compromise the right of action, and
the Board's decision is final and conclusive.
(4)
If, by an action under subsection (2), more is recovered and collected
than the amount of the compensation to which the worker or dependant
would be entitled under the compensation provisions, the amount of the
excess, less costs and administration charges, must be paid by the
Board to the worker or dependant.
Constraint on recovery if some fault attributable to employer or other
worker
131
The following apply if, in an action brought by a worker, by a
dependant of a worker or by the Board, it is found that the injury,
disablement or death of the worker, as applicable, was due partly to a
breach of duty of care of one or more employers or other workers to
which the compensation provisions apply:
(a)
no damages, contributions or indemnity are recoverable for the portion
of the loss or damage caused by the negligence of such an employer or
other worker;
(b)
the portion of the loss or damage caused by that negligence must be
determined despite the employer, other worker or both, as applicable,
not being a party to the action.
Limitation on legal proceedings by employer of injured or deceased
worker
132
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), the provisions of the compensation
provisions are in place of any right of action that the employer of an
injured or deceased worker is or may, in respect of the personal
injury or death of the worker, be entitled to maintain against
(a)
another employer within the scope of the compensation provisions, or
(b)
an independent operator to whom the compensation provisions apply by
Board direction under section 4 (2) (a)
[Board direction of application]
.
(2)
Subsection (1) does not affect any right an employer may have against
another employer, or against an independent operator referred to in
subsection (1) (b), arising out of an indemnity agreement or contract
between the employer of the worker and the other employer or
independent operator.

solely to the serious and wilful misconduct of the worker,
compensation is not payable unless the injury results in the worker's
death or serious or permanent disablement.
(3)

(a)
if the accident arose out of the worker's employment, unless the
contrary is shown, it must be presumed that the injury occurred in the

has a mental disorder that, at the time of the diagnosis under
subsection (1) (b), is recognized in the manual referred to in that

more traumatic events arising out of and in the course of the worker's
employment in that eligible occupation, unless the contrary is proved.

a worker receives compensation for permanent partial disability for
the original injury, and

Maximum compensation in the case of further disability
200
(1)
If a worker is receiving compensation for a permanent or temporary

commuted under section 230
[commutation of periodic payments to lump sum payment]

worker before the injury if that other worker had a compensable
disability similar to the compensable disability of the applicant
worker.
(10)
A reconsideration decision under this section must not result in
periodic payments to a worker being less than they would have been if

tribunal must resolve that issue in a manner that favours the worker.
Application of policies of the board of directors

tribunal, and the appeal tribunal is bound by that determination.
(9)
The chair must not make a general delegation of the chair's authority
under subsection (3), (4) or (5) but, if the chair considers there may

purposes of a specific appeal.

an injustice would otherwise result.

Interpretation of table
1
In the table in this Schedule,
(a)
a range of decibels set out in column 1 reflects hearing loss measured
in accordance with section 2 of this Schedule,
(b)
a percentage of disability set out in column 2 opposite a range of
decibels set out in column 1 is the percentage of disability for
the ear most affected by the hearing loss, and
(c)
a percentage of disability set out in column 3 opposite a range of
decibels set out in column 1 is the percentage of disability for
the ear least affected by the hearing loss.
Measuring hearing loss
2
(1)
Loss of hearing is measured
(a)
by calculating the average of the threshold of hearing in each ear
measured at the frequencies of 1 000, 2 000, 3 000 and
4 000 Hertz, in turn, by pure-tone air- or bone-conduction
audiometry, and
(b)
using an audiometer calibrated by a facility that meets the
requirements established by the Board.
(2)
For the purposes of section 198 (2) of this Act, a loss of hearing in
the range of decibels set out in column 1 of item 11 of the
table in this Schedule constitutes a complete loss of hearing.
Percentage of total disability
3
For the purposes of section 198 of this Act,
(a)
the percentage of total disability is the sum of the percentage of
disability for the ear most affected by the hearing loss and the
percentage of disability for the ear least affected by the hearing
loss,
(b)
the maximum percentage of total disability for a complete loss of
hearing in one ear and no loss of hearing in the other ear is 6%,
and
(c)
the maximum percentage of total disability for a complete loss of
hearing in both ears is 36%.
