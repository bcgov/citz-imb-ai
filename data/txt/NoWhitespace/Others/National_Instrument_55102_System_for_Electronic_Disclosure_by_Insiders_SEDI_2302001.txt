agent must certify that the information is true and complete in every
respect by selecting "Certify" on the web page titled "Create insider
profile - Certify and file insider profile" and following the
instructions provided for this purpose. In the case of an agent, the
certification is based on the agent's best knowledge, information and
belief but the insider is still responsible for ensuring that the

submit information that, in a material respect and at the time and in
the light of the circumstances in which it is submitted, is misleading
or untrue.

information" web page, provide the date on which the previous paper
filing was made.
3  Review issuer information
Review the information contained in the insider profile with respect to
the selected reporting issuer to ensure that the information is correct.
To do this, click on "Insider profile" in the top bar and the
"Introduction to insider profile activities (Form 55-102F1)" screen will
appear.
You must review the information in the insider profile with respect to
the selected reporting issuer and, if the information is not correct,
you must amend it by filing an amended insider profile. To do this,
click on "Amend insider profile" in the bar on the left side and make
the necessary corrections.
4  Review new issuer event reports
If the reporting issuer has filed an issuer event report that has not
previously been viewed or that has been previously flagged for further
viewing, you must review the issuer event report.
To do this you must do the following: i) After you have selected an
issuer and before selecting the "File insider report" feature, on the
screen entitled "File insider report (Form 55-102F2) — Select issuer",
click on the feature entitled "View issuer event reports" and the
"Listing of issuer event reports" screen appears. ii) Next, click on
the radio button for the report you wish to see and then select "View
Report" and the "View issuer report information" screen appears with
the text of the issuer event report.
If the insider's holdings of securities of the reporting issuer have
been affected by an issuer event, the change in holdings must be
reported.
5  Security designation
For each position or transaction being reported, provide the security
designation for the applicable security or class of securities. For this
purpose, select the applicable security designation from the list shown
for the reporting issuer's outstanding securities.
If the applicable security designation does not appear in the list,
check the "archived security designation" list containing designations
of securities of the reporting issuer that are no longer outstanding and
that may no longer be issued. Alternatively, check the "Insider defined
security" list that will contain one or more security designations for
the reporting issuer if any have been defined previously by or for the
insider. In either case, if the applicable securities designation
appears in the list, select it.
If the applicable security designation does not appear in any of the
lists described above, the insider must define the applicable security
designation. For this purpose, select the appropriate "Security
category" by choosing "Debt", "Equity", "Issuer Derivative" or "Third
Party Derivative" from the list provided. For purposes of the insider
reporting requirement, "issuer derivative" means a derivative issued by
the reporting issuer to which the insider reporting requirement relates
and "third party derivative" means a derivative issued by a person or
company other than the reporting issuer to which the insider reporting
requirement relates. The security category selected will determine the
nature of the information that is required to be reported in relation to
positions or transactions involving the applicable security designation.
Next, create the "insider defined" security designation by selecting the
most appropriate "Security name" from the list provided and, if
applicable, use the "Additional description" field to enter any
additional words used to describe the specific security or class of
securities. For example, to provide the security designation of "Class A
Preferred Shares, Series 1", select "Preferred Shares" from the
"Security name" list and then type "Class A, Series 1" in the
"Additional description" field.
Important Note:
If the security or class of securities being designated is a security
that has been issued by the reporting issuer, it is important to try to
avoid creating an "insider defined" security designation. If a security
designation has not been created by the reporting issuer in respect of a
security or class of securities issued by the reporting issuer, contact
the reporting issuer to request that the security designation be added
to the list of security designations for the reporting issuer's
outstanding securities in its issuer profile supplement. However, you
must create an "insider defined" security designation if this becomes
necessary to ensure that the insider report is filed on a timely basis.
Derivatives:
If the security or class of securities being designated is an issuer
derivative or a third party derivative, provide the security designation
for the derivative and the security designation for the underlying
security. See item 18 below. In addition, if the security or class of
securities being designated is a third party derivative, the insider
will have to provide the applicable security designation in all cases.
6  Ownership type
Indicate whether the securities in respect of which a position or
transaction is being reported are (1) beneficially owned directly, (2)
beneficially owned indirectly or (3) controlled or directed. Securities
beneficially owned directly but held through a nominee such as a broker
or book-based depository are considered direct holdings.
7  Identity of registered holder of securities where
ownership is indirect or where control or direction is exercised
If beneficial ownership of the securities is indirect or if control or
direction is exercised over the securities, provide the name of the
registered holder of the securities. If the name of the registered
holder has been previously added to the insider's profile in respect of
the reporting issuer, select the name of the registered holder from the
list shown. Otherwise, enter the full legal name of the registered
holder in the field provided.
8  Opening balance of securities held (initial SEDI report
only)
If the insider is filing an initial report in respect of securities held
on becoming an insider or is reporting a change in a security or class
of securities previously reported only in paper format, for each
security or class of securities held directly or by a particular
registered holder, disclose the initial number or amount of securities
so held in the field provided for this purpose on the web page titled
"File insider report — Opening balance on initial SEDI report
(Non-Derivatives)", or the corresponding web page for derivatives, as
applicable. For debt securities, provide the aggregate nominal value of
the securities held.
If an opening balance of securities held is required to be disclosed,
the information with respect to the "date of transaction" and "nature of
transaction" required under items 9 and 10 below will be generated by
the SEDI software application. The "Opening/initial balance date" will
be the date the insider became an insider or the date the insider
entered for all opening balances for securities of this issuer.
If the insider has previously filed a report in SEDI disclosing the
balance of the security or class of securities held directly or by a
particular registered holder, the opening balance of the security or
class of securities so held is generated by the SEDI software
application based on all previous reports filed in respect of the
particular holding.
If an initial SEDI report involves the holding of a derivative, see item
19 below.
9  Date of transaction
Provide the date of each transaction being reported using the fields
provided for this purpose. Provide the "trade date" not the "settlement
date".
10  Nature of transaction
Indicate the nature of each transaction being reported by selecting the
most appropriate transaction type from the list provided for this
purpose.
11  Number or value of securities acquired
Disclose the number or value of securities acquired for each transaction
involving an acquisition of securities. For debt securities, provide the
aggregate nominal value. If the transaction involved the acquisition of
an option, warrant, right or other derivative, see items 21 and 22
below.
12  Number or value of securities disposed of
Disclose the number or value of securities disposed of for each
transaction involving a disposition of securities. For debt securities,
provide the aggregate nominal value. If the transaction involved the
disposition of an option, warrant, right or other derivative, see items
21 and 22 below.
13  Unit price or exercise price
Disclose the price per security paid or received by the insider for each
transaction being reported, if applicable. Do not reduce the price being
reported to reflect the amount of any commission paid. If the insider
acquired or disposed of a security upon the exercise of an option,
warrant, right or other derivative, report the exercise price per
security. If the insider acquired or disposed of an option, warrant,
right or other derivative, see item 23 below.
If the transaction involved consideration other than cash, provide the
approximate fair value of the consideration in Canadian dollars and
describe the consideration in the "General remarks" field. If no
consideration was paid or received by the insider, check "Not
applicable".
14  Currency
If the price paid or received in any transaction was in a currency other
than Canadian dollars, provide the amount in that other currency and
select the other currency from the list provided for this purpose.
15  Closing balance of securities held
After each new transaction being reported in respect of a security or
class of securities held directly or through a particular registered
holder has been entered, a new balance of the security or class of
securities held directly or by the particular registered holder will be
generated automatically by SEDI prior to filing. If the insider believes
that the closing balance reported by SEDI is not correct, the closing
balance calculated by the insider must be reported in the field provided
for this purpose. The insider shall make all reasonable efforts to
reconcile the balance calculated by SEDI with the balance believed by
the insider to be correct. An incorrect balance may have resulted from
an error in a previous insider report or from a failure to report a
previous transaction.
16  General remarks
Provide additional information if necessary to provide an accurate
description of each position and/or transaction in securities being
reported. Information provided in this field will be accessible by the
public.
17  Private remarks to securities regulatory authority
Using the field provided, the insider may disclose additional
information with respect to the position or transaction being reported
to staff of the securities regulatory authority. Information provided in
this field will not be accessible by the public.
Holdings or Transactions Involving Derivatives
If a holding or transaction being reported by the insider involves an
issuer derivative or a third party derivative, the additional
information prescribed below shall be disclosed, if applicable. For this
purpose, "issuer derivative" means a derivative issued by the reporting
issuer to which the insider reporting requirement relates, and "third
party derivative" means a derivative issued by a person or company other
than the reporting issuer to which the insider reporting requirement
relates.
18  Security designation of derivative and underlying
security
Provide the security designation for the derivative in the manner
described under item 5 above. Next, select the appropriate security
category for the underlying security from the list provided and then
provide the security designation for the underlying security in a
similar manner to that described under item 5 above. If the security or
class of securities being designated is a third party derivative, the
insider will have to define the applicable security designation in all
cases. If the derivative security has been defined by the insider, the
underlying security must also be defined by the insider.
19  Opening balance of derivative securities or contracts
held (initial SEDI report only)
If the insider is filing an initial report disclosing an option,
warrant, right or other derivative held on becoming an insider or is
reporting a change in such a derivative not previously reported in SEDI
format, for each such derivative position so held directly or by a
particular registered holder, disclose the initial number of derivative
securities or contracts held in the field provided for this purpose.
20  Opening balance of equivalent number of underlying
securities (initial SEDI report only)
If the insider is filing an initial report of an option, warrant, right
or other derivative held on becoming an insider or is reporting a change
in any such derivative not previously reported in SEDI format, for each
such derivative position held directly or by a particular registered
holder, disclose the actual or notional number or amount of underlying
securities that may be acquired or disposed of upon exercise or
settlement of such derivative. If the underlying securities are debt
securities, provide the aggregate nominal value of the actual or
notional amount of underlying debt securities that may be acquired or
disposed of upon exercise or settlement of such derivative.
21  Number of derivative securities or contracts acquired or
disposed of
Disclose the number of derivative securities or contracts acquired for
each transaction involving an acquisition of a derivative or the number
of derivative securities or contracts disposed of for each transaction
involving a disposition of a derivative.
22  Equivalent number of underlying securities acquired or
disposed of
For each transaction involving an acquisition or disposition of a
derivative, disclose the actual or notional number or amount of
underlying securities that may be acquired or disposed of upon exercise
or settlement of the derivative. If the underlying securities are debt
securities, provide the aggregate nominal value of the equivalent amount
of underlying debt securities that may be acquired or disposed of upon
exercise or settlement of the derivative.
23  Unit price of derivative
Disclose the premium or other amount paid or received by the insider in
connection with the acquisition or disposition of the derivative (per
contract if applicable). If the premium or other amount paid or received
was in a currency other than Canadian dollars, provide the amount in
that other currency and select the other currency from the list provided
for this purpose.
24  Conversion or exercise price of derivative
Provide the conversion or exercise price of the derivative by entering
the amount in the field provided for this purpose (per underlying
security if applicable). If the conversion or exercise price is in a
currency other than Canadian dollars, select the relevant currency from
the list provided for this purpose. If the conversion or exercise price
of the derivative will adjust on one or more specified dates, provide
the details of the adjustment terms in the "General remarks" field.
25  Date of expiry or maturity of derivative
If the derivative expires or matures on a given date, specify the date
of expiry or maturity using the fields provided for this purpose.
Certification
Prior to filing an insider report, the insider or the insider's agent
must certify that the information is true and complete in every respect.
In the case of an agent, the certification is based on the agent's best
knowledge, information and belief but the insider is still responsible
for ensuring that the information filed by the agent is true and
complete. It is an offence to submit information that, in a material
respect and at the time and in the light of the circumstances in which
it is submitted, is misleading or untrue.

Issuer Profile Supplement
An issuer profile supplement filed in SEDI format shall contain the
information prescribed below. The information shall be entered using the
online version of this form accessible by SEDI users at the SEDI web
site (www.sedi.ca). All references to web pages, fields and lists relate
to the online version of the form.
1  Name of reporting issuer
Provide the name of the reporting issuer for which the issuer profile
supplement is being created by searching for the reporting issuer using
the reporting issuer's SEDAR+ number or the reporting issuer's legal
name (in English or French). If the reporting issuer's name does not
appear in the search results, an issuer profile must be created for the
reporting issuer in SEDAR+ before proceeding further with any SEDI
filings.
2  Name of insider affairs contact
Provide the full legal name of an individual who will act as "insider
affairs contact" for the reporting issuer. Use the "Family name" and
"Given names" fields for this purpose. Use upper and lower case letters
as applicable. Do not use initials, nicknames or abbreviations. SEDI
will automatically deliver an e-mail message to the e-mail address
provided for the insider affairs contact each time an insider profile or
an amended insider profile is filed by or on behalf of a person or
company disclosing an insider relationship with the reporting issuer.
This is intended to assist the reporting issuer in identifying any
incorrect or inappropriate SEDI filings made in respect of the reporting
issuer. Insider affairs contact information is not accessible by the
public.
3  Address of insider affairs contact
Provide a business address for the insider affairs contact. Indicate the
country and provide the address (street name and number, etc.), the
municipality (city, town, etc.), province, territory or state and postal
or zip code, as applicable. A post office box or similar mailing address
is not acceptable.
4  Telephone number and e-mail address of insider affairs
contact
Provide a business telephone number and a business e-mail address for
the insider affairs contact.
5  Fax number of insider affairs contact (if applicable)
If available, provide a business fax number for the insider affairs
contact.
6  Confidential question and answer
Provide a "confidential question" and an answer to the confidential
question for use in identifying the issuer's representative if a request
is being made to the SEDI operator for a new issuer access key. Keep a
record of the confidential question and answer in a secure location.
7  Security designations
Provide the security designation for each outstanding security and each
class of outstanding securities of the reporting issuer that is held by
an insider of the reporting issuer who has direct or indirect beneficial
ownership of, or control or direction over, that security or class of
security. For each security or class of securities, select the
appropriate "Security category" by choosing "Debt", "Equity" or "Issuer
Derivative" from the list provided. Then provide a designation of the
security or class of securities using the fields provided for this
purpose, as follows. First, select the "Security name" from the list of
generic security names provided. Second, if applicable, enter any
additional words used to describe the specific security or class of
securities. For example, to provide the designation of "Class A
Preferred Shares, Series 1", select "Preferred Shares" from the
"Security name" field and then type "Class A, Series 1" in the
"Additional description" field.
If the security whose designation is being added is an issuer
derivative, provide the designation of the underlying security or class
of underlying securities in addition to the designation of the issuer
derivative itself. First, select the applicable securities category for
the underlying security and then provide the designation for the
underlying security using the "Security name" and "Additional
description" fields in the same manner as described above.
8  Amending a security designation
If there is any change in the security designation disclosed previously
for a security or class of securities of the reporting issuer that is
outstanding or that may be issued in the future, use the "Amend security
designation" function to amend the applicable security designation in
the issuer profile supplement. Select the applicable security
designation to be amended and a web page with pre-populated fields
containing the existing security designation information will be
displayed for purposes of making the necessary amendment(s).
Note that a security designation should only be amended for corrections
or for changes that do not result in the security or class of securities
ceasing to exist. If a security or class of securities ceases to exist
and is replaced by another security or class of securities, the "old"
security must be archived in the manner described under item 9 below and
a security designation must be added for the "new" security in the
manner described under item 7 above.
If the security or class of securities affected by the change is an
underlying security for an issuer derivative, use the "Amend security
designation" function to amend the security designation of the
underlying security as well.
9  Archiving a security designation
If any security or class of securities designated previously by the
reporting issuer has ceased to be outstanding and the security or class
of securities may no longer be issued, use the "Archive security
designation" function to remove the relevant security designation from
the reporting issuer's list of "outstanding securities" and place it in
the reporting issuer's list of "archived securities". Archived security
designations may not be reactivated if the applicable security or class
of securities is re-issued or becomes subject to the issuance. In such
circumstances, a new security designation must be added to the issuer
profile supplement in the manner described under item 7 above.

securities when applied to the number of securities held by affected
insiders, indicate whether the number of securities held by the insider
shall be rounded up or down.
If the issuer event involved the creation of a new security or class of
securities or the formation of a new reporting issuer, disclose this
