terms".
(2)
Despite a borrower's former repayment terms or the terms of the
borrower's student loan agreement, the following are repayment terms
on which the British Columbia student loans of that borrower must be
paid:
(a)
effective July 1, 2012,
(i)
prime rate is the variable reference rate of interest as calculated by
the federal minister for the purposes of Canada student loans, and
(ii)
the scheduled monthly payment under the borrower's former repayment
terms, or, if the borrower has been making more than one scheduled
payment each month under those terms, the sum of those scheduled
payments, must be paid on the last day of each month;
(b)
effective March 1, 2012, no fees or charges are payable by the
borrower in respect of payments that
(i)
are not honoured by the borrower's financial institution because of
insufficient funds, and
(ii)
are due on or after that date.

Despite a borrower's former repayment terms or the terms of the
borrower's student loan agreement, for a borrower who meets all the
following criteria:
(a)
the borrower has a Canada student loan;
(b)

(c)
the borrower is not enrolled in a debt management program;
(d)
the borrower is not an undischarged bankrupt;
(e)
any prescribed criteria,
effective July 1, 2012, the following are repayment terms on which the

(i)
first to outstanding fees and charges described in
subsection (2) (b) (i) that accrued in respect of
payments due before March 1, 2012;
(ii)
next to outstanding accrued interest;
(iii)
next to principal balance, including any capitalized interest;
(g)
subject to paragraph (f), the amount of the borrower's scheduled
monthly payment that is to be credited to the borrower's British
Columbia student loan for a particular month is the amount that
results from the following calculation:
(BCSL payment + CLS payment) x
BCSL balance
(BCSL balance + CSL balance)
where
BCSL payment
=
the amount a borrower must pay monthly in respect of the
borrower's British Columbia student loan under the borrower's
former repayment terms;
CSL payment
=
the amount that, on June 30, 2012, the borrower must pay monthly
to Canada in respect of the borrower's Canada student loan under
the terms of that loan;
BCSL balance
=
the outstanding principal amount of the borrower's British
Columbia student loan on the date the payment is made, including
any capitalized interest;
CSL balance
=
the outstanding principal amount of the borrower's Canada
student loan on the date the payment is made, including any
capitalized interest;
(h)
a prepayment made in respect of a British Columbia student loan is to
be prorated between the borrower's British Columbia student loan and
Canada student loan by applying the calculation set out in paragraph
(g), but substituting the amount of the prepayment for "(BCSL payment
+ CSL payment)" in the calculation;
(i)
amortization period is the number of months, to a maximum of 234
months, required to reduce the borrower's BCSL balance, as that term
is described in paragraph (g), to zero if
(i)
the borrower makes payments equal to the sum of BCSL payment and CSL
payment, as those terms are described in paragraph (g), at the
interest rate applicable under the borrower's new repayment terms, and
(ii)
those payments are applied as set out in paragraph (g) to the sum of
BCSL balance and CSL balance, as those terms are described in
paragraph (g).
(4)
Subsections (2) (a) (ii) and (3) do not apply in respect of a borrower
(a)
who at any time before July 1, 2012 has failed to make 5 or more
consecutive scheduled payments on his or her British Columbia student
loan, and
(b)
in respect of whom the government has not subsequently approved an
application for
(i)
different repayment terms for that loan under which terms the loan is
treated as being in good standing on the date the application is
approved,
(ii)
interest-free status for that loan, or
(iii)
a new British Columbia student loan.
(5)
Unless it is a Master Student Financial Assistance Agreement for
Canada and British Columbia, the student loan agreement of each
borrower, within the meaning of his or her student loan agreement, is
conclusively deemed to have included the following term when the
student loan agreement was entered into:
The Province may amend this agreement from time to time for the
purpose of aligning the terms of this agreement with the terms of the
Master Student Financial Assistance Agreement for Canada and British
Columbia and will send written notice of any amendment to this
agreement to the borrower at the borrower's address as shown in this
agreement or another address the borrower has provided. On receipt of
such a notice, the borrower may repay all amounts owed within 14 days,
but if all amounts are not paid within that period, the borrower is
conclusively deemed to have accepted the amendment in respect of which
the notice was sent.
(6)
Nothing in subsection (2) or (3)
(a)
prevents the government and the borrower from entering into an
agreement on or after July 1, 2012 for repayment of the borrower's
British Columbia student loan on terms different from the new
repayment terms, or
(b)
restricts the authority of the government to, in accordance with the
terms of a student loan agreement, amend the student loan agreement or
change the provisions of that student loan agreement.
(7)
No action lies, and a legal proceeding may not be brought or
continued, against the government or any person acting on behalf of
the government for compensation, damages or any other remedy arising
as a direct or indirect consequence of
(a)
the changes made under subsection (2) or (3) to the terms on which a
British Columbia student loan must be repaid, or
(b)
any amendments to a student loan agreement under the term included in
the student loan agreement under subsection (5).
