Commentary
1. this commentary applies to subsections (3), (4) and (5).
2. the value disclosed in columns (d) and (e) of the summary Compensation table should reflect what the company paid, made payable, Awarded, granted, gave or otherwise provided as compensation on the Grant date (fair value of the award) as set out in comment 3, below.
This value might differ from the value reported in the issuer's Financial statements.
3. while compensation practices vary, there are generally two Approaches that boards of directors use when setting compensation. a Board of directors may decide the value in securities of the company To be awarded or paid as compensation. alternatively, a board of Directors may decide the portion of the potential ownership of the Company to be transferred as compensation. a fair value ascribed to The award will normally result from these approaches.
A company may calculate this value either in accordance with a Valuation methodology identified in ifrs 2 share-based payment or in Accordance with another methodology set out in comment 5 below.
4. in some cases, the fair value of the award disclosed in columns (d) And (e) might differ from the accounting fair value. for financial Statement purposes, the accounting fair value amount is amortized over The service period to obtain an accounting cost (accounting Compensation expense), adjusted at year end as required.
5. while the most commonly used methodologies for calculating the Value of most types of awards are the black-scholes-merton model and The binomial lattice model, companies may choose to use another Valuation methodology if it produces a more meaningful and reasonable Estimate of fair value.
6. the summary compensation table requires disclosure of an amount Even if the accounting compensation expense is zero. the amount Disclosed in the table should reflect the fair value of the award Following the principles described under comments 2 and 3, above.

This requirement does not apply to any repricing that equally affects All holders of the class of securities underlying the options and that Occurs through a pre-existing formula or mechanism in the plan or award That results in the periodic adjustment of the option exercise or base Price, an antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a Recapitalization or similar transaction.
