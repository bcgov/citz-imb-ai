derivative referred to in item 1 exceeds the capped rounded notional
amount, in Canadian dollars, according to the asset class and maturity
date less execution time stamp date set out in Table 4 for that
derivative, a recognized trade repository must make available to the
public the capped rounded notional amount for the derivative in place
of the rounded notional amount.

When making transaction-level data for a derivative to which item 4
applies available to the public under subsection 39 (3) of this
Instrument and in accordance with this Appendix, a recognized trade
repository must state that the notional amount for the derivative has
been capped.

notional amount is made available to the public, if the data to be
made available to the public includes an option premium, the
recognized trade repository must adjust the option premium in a manner
that is consistent with and proportionate to the capping and rounding
of the reported notional amount of the transaction.
