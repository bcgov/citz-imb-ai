"phase ii" Means a compliance sampling period commencing on a date specified in Writing by the director; "prod" Means, subject to subsection (2), the 90th percentile of the daily Production rate of a pulp or paper or pulp and paper mill, expressed As adt, determined by the use of statistical methods, and using a Period of time approved by a director for determination of the 90th Percentile of the rate of production; "96 h lc50 toxicity" Means the calculated concentration of effluent that is lethal to 50% Of the test fish (rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss)) during a 96 Hour exposure.
(2) If there is an insufficient number of days of production to perform a Valid 90th percentile calculation of cbprod, eff or prod, the director May use the mill's chlorine or chlorine compound bleached pulp Production design figure, effluent flow design figure or production Design figure respectively as values for cbprod, eff or prod until Such time as these parameters may be calculated in accordance with Subsection (1).
