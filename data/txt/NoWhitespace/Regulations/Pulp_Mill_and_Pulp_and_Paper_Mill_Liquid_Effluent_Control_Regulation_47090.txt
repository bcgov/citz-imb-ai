Environmental Management Act
Pulp Mill and Pulp and Paper Mill Liquid Effluent Control Regulation
[includes amendments up to B.C. Reg. 46/2018, April 1, 2018]
Interpretation
1
(1)
In this regulation:
"Act"
means the
Environmental Management Act
;
"ADt"
means an air dry tonne of pulp product where the weight of the pulp
product is corrected to reflect the weight that the pulp product would
be if the pulp were composed of 10% water and 90% fibre;
"AOX"
means halogenated organic compounds that are adsorbable by activated
carbon;
"CBPROD"
means, subject to subsection (2), the 90th percentile of the daily
production rate of bleached pulp produced from an on-site bleach plant
with the use of chlorine or chlorine compounds, or both chlorine and
chlorine compounds, expressed as ADt, determined by the use of
statistical methods, and using a period of time approved by a director
for determination of the 90th percentile of the rate of chlorine or
chlorine compound bleached pulp production;
"compliance sampling method"
means the technique used to collect samples which are subsequently
analyzed to determine if the effluent satisfies the quality standards
established under sections 2, 3 and 6;
"EFF"
means, subject to subsection (2), the 90th percentile of the rate of
effluent, expressed as m
3
/day, including any sanitary effluent combined with process effluent,
discharged from a pulp or paper or pulp and paper mill, determined by
the use of statistical methods, and using a period of time approved by
a director for determination of the 90th percentile of the rate of
discharge of effluent;
"permittee"
means a person who holds a permit issued under section 14 of the Act;
"phase I"
means a compliance sampling period commencing on the date this
regulation comes into force and expiring on the date that phase II
commences;
"phase II"
means a compliance sampling period commencing on a date specified in
writing by the director;
"PROD"
means, subject to subsection (2), the 90th percentile of the daily
production rate of a pulp or paper or pulp and paper mill, expressed
as ADt, determined by the use of statistical methods, and using a
period of time approved by a director for determination of the 90th
percentile of the rate of production;
"96 h LC50 toxicity"
means the calculated concentration of effluent that is lethal to 50%
of the test fish (rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)) during a 96
hour exposure.
(2)
If there is an insufficient number of days of production to perform a
valid 90th percentile calculation of CBPROD, EFF or PROD, the director
may use the mill's chlorine or chlorine compound bleached pulp
production design figure, effluent flow design figure or production
design figure respectively as values for CBPROD, EFF or PROD until
such time as these parameters may be calculated in accordance with
subsection (1).

Sampling methods for compliance determination
3
(1)
The compliance sampling method used to determine the effluent flow
rate and temperature shall be as specified in writing by a director.
(2)
The compliance sampling method used to provide an effluent sample for
determination of the 96 h LC50 toxicity shall consist of a
grab sample.
(3)
The compliance sampling method used to provide effluent samples for
determination of the 5 day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD
5
), the total suspended solids (TSS) and the AOX during phase I shall
consist of collecting an effluent sample during a period of 24 hours
by taking
(a)
a continuous sample of the effluent being discharged from each
effluent outfall,

15 minutes, or
