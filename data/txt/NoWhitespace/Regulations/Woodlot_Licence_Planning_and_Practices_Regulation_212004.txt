into consideration only those factors contained in Schedule 1, the
minister must not require the holder to consider other factors.
(2)
The minister may request information under section 16 (2.1)
[approval of woodlot licence plan or amendment]

relevant to any factor that the holder addressed that is not a factor
listed in Schedule 1, and
(c)
either available to the holder or in the control or possession of the
holder.

respect of regeneration date, free growing date and stocking
standards, and a stocking standard described under section 12

requirement or stocking standard will result in the area being stocked
with or retaining, as applicable, ecologically suitable species that
address immediate and long-term forest health issues on the area, to a
density or to a basal area that, in either case, is consistent with
(a)
section 9 (1) (a)

(b)
the timber supply projections and forest management assumptions that
apply to the area covered by the plan on the date that the plan is
submitted for approval.
(4)
The minister must not refuse to approve an alternative performance
requirement solely on the basis that performance of the alternative
performance requirement
(a)
would result in an outcome that is outside of the range of natural
variation that is characteristic of a season, an area or a forest
resource,
(b)
would cause or contribute to an adverse impact on a forest resource,
if that impact would be consistent with the objectives described in
section 8
[mapping and information]
,
(c)
proposes an innovative means of meeting the intent of the requirement
to which the alternative performance requirement relates, or
(d)
is based on a factor other than one specified in Schedule 1.

(i)
decrease the area where harvesting will be avoided or constrained, or
(ii)
increase the adverse impact on forest resources,
(b)
the reclassification of a stream, wetland or lake, or
(c)
the wildlife tree retention strategy prepared under section 11
