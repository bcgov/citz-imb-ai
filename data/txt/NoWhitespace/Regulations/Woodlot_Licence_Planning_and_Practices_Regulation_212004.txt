Factors relating to biodiversity 2 The following factors may be used for the purpose of developing a Comprehensive wildlife tree retention strategy referred to in section 11 [wildlife tree retention strategy required] :
(a) The size, structure, amount, location and other characteristics of Trees that (i) Make the trees suitable for wildlife habitat, and (ii) Have ecological attributes that contribute to stand level Biodiversity;
(b) The extent to which wildlife habitat areas, ungulate winter ranges, Riparian management zones, riparian reserve zones, scenic areas and Other areas established to manage forest resources (i) Provide suitable wildlife habitat, and (ii) Assist in the conservation of stand level biodiversity.
Factors relating to objective set by government for soils 3 The following factors may be used to determine if a woodlot licence Plan is consistent with the objective set out in section 9 (1) (b) [established objectives] :
(a) The amount of productive forest land base that will be occupied by Permanent access structures; (b) The amount of soil disturbance within the net area to be reforested, Having regard to (i) The classification of soils based on their biological, physical and Chemical properties, including their sensitivity to displacement, Surface erosion and compaction, (ii) The kinds of disturbance that are detrimental to productivity and Hydrological function, (iii) The amount of detrimental disturbance that can occur without unduly Compromising productivity or hydrological function, and (iv) The extent to which rehabilitation efforts can mitigate the effects of Detrimental disturbance.
Factors relating to water, fish, wildlife and biodiversity in riparian Areas
4 The following factors may be used to determine if a woodlot licence Plan is consistent with the objective set out in section 9 (1) (c) [established objectives] :
