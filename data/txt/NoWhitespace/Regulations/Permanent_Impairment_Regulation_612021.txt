(c) If the insured sustains a permanent impairment that is not described In the schedule, the corporation must calculate and determine a Percentage for the permanent impairment using one or more permanent Impairments described in the schedule as a guide to establish a Percentage for the permanent impairment not described in the schedule.
(2) If, under subsection (1), the corporation calculates and Determines only one percentage in the schedule is applicable to a Permanent impairment sustained by the insured, the percentage Corresponding to the permanent impairment is the permanent impairment Component.
(3) If an insured's permanent impairment component is determined by Reference to more than one permanent impairment, the permanent Impairment component must be determined using the following formula:
C = a + (b(1 − a)) Where
A
= (a) For the first application of the formula, subject to Subsection (4), the highest percentage corresponding to the Permanent impairments sustained by the insured; (b) For any subsequent application of the formula, the value solved For as c in the previous calculation; B
= (a) For the first application of the formula, subject to Subsection (4), the second highest percentage corresponding To the permanent impairments sustained by the insured; (b) For any subsequent application of the formula, subject to Subsection (4), the next highest percentage corresponding To the permanent impairments sustained by the insured; C
= (a) Subject to subsection (4), the value to be used as a in Each subsequent application of the formula; (b) If the b variable is the lowest percentage corresponding to the Permanent impairments sustained by the insured when applying the Formula, the permanent impairment component.
(4) If any of the following result in a fraction of a percentage, the Fraction must be rounded to the nearest whole percentage and if a Percentage ends in .5 it must be rounded up to the nearest whole Percentage:
(a) The percentage corresponding to a permanent impairment sustained by The insured; (b) The percentage determined in accordance with subsection (3) as The c variable in each subsequent application of the formula; (c) The permanent impairment component calculated and determined in Accordance with paragraph (b) of variable c.
Enhancement component for symmetrical body parts 6 (1) Subject to section 7, the enhancement component set out in Subsection (2) is added to the permanent impairment component to Determine the permanent impairment rating if an anatomicophysiological Deficit resulting from the accident (a) Impairs symmetrical body parts, or (b) Impairs a body part that is symmetrical to a body part that was Permanently impaired before the accident.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the enhancement component Must be calculated using the following formula:
Ec = a × 0.25 Where
Ec
= The enhancement component; A
= Subject to subsection (3), the percentage calculated and Determined
(a) By applying section 5 as if the percentage to be calculated and Determined were the permanent impairment component, and (b) Excluding all permanent impairments resulting from the accident Except those permanent impairments that correspond to the most Severely impaired symmetrical part of the insured's body.
(3) For the purposes of variable a in subsection (2), the percentage Of an anatomicophysiological deficit that existed before an accident Must be calculated and determined in accordance with section 5 as if The deficit resulted from the accident.
Exceptions to section 6 7 The enhancement component determined in accordance with section 6 does Not apply to any of the following anatomicophysiological deficits:
(a) A deficit that affects an internal organ; (b) A deficit that affects an organ controlling vision, balance or Hearing;
(c) A deficit that results from an injury to the central nervous system; (d) A deficit that affects the teeth.
Permanent impairment compensation calculation — catastrophic injury 8 If the insured sustains a catastrophic injury, the permanent Impairment compensation is $264 430.
Permanent impairment compensation calculation — non-catastrophic Injury
9 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the compensation for an insured's Permanent impairment that is not a catastrophic injury must be Calculated and determined using the following formula:
P = pir × $167 465 Where
P
= Permanent impairment compensation in dollars; Pir
= The insured's permanent impairment rating.
(2) Despite subsection (1), if the permanent impairment compensation Determined in accordance with subsection (1) is more than $0, the Minimum compensation in relation to a permanent impairment is $836.
Compensation determined at time of accident 10 (1) For the purposes of this section, "permanent" In relation to an impairment, means (a) Following a period of time sufficient for optimal tissue repair, the Impairment
(i) Has become static, or (ii) Has stabilized, and (b) The impairment is unlikely to change significantly with further Therapy.
(2) The corporation must not pay the compensation under section 8 or 9 Until the impairment is permanent.
(3) The corporation must calculate and determine the compensation under Section 8 or 9 as of the date of the accident.
