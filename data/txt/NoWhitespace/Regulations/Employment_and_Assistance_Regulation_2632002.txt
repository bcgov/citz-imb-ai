If the family unit includes one or more dependent children or deemed
dependent children, the support allowance under subsection (1) for a
calendar month is increased by an amount equal to
(a)

(b)
the sum of
(i)
the family bonus, if any, paid to the family unit for the preceding
month,
(ii)
the Canada child benefit, if any, paid to the family unit for the
preceding month in respect of dependent children in the family unit,
up to a maximum of the BC child adjustment amount in respect of those

family unit under section 61
[supplement for delayed, suspended or cancelled family bonus]
or 61.1
[supplement for delayed, suspended or cancelled Canada child
benefit]
of this regulation for the current calendar month.
(2.1)
If the amount calculated under subsection (2) is less than zero, it is
deemed to be zero for the purposes of this section.
(3)
In calculating the adjustment under subsection (2), an amount that,
under the
Income Tax Act
(British Columbia) or the
Income Tax Act
(Canada), is deducted or set off from the family bonus or the Canada
child benefit must be treated as if it were paid to a person in the
family unit.
(4)
The support allowance under subsection (1) for a calendar month is not
increased under subsection (2) if a person in the family unit refuses
to
(a)
apply for the family bonus or the Canada child benefit for the
preceding calendar month, or
(b)
accept the family bonus or the Canada child benefit for the preceding
calendar month
in respect of a dependent child in the family unit who is, or may be,
a qualified dependant within the meaning of the
Income Tax Act
(Canada).
(5)
If a family unit includes a person who
(a)
immediately before reaching 19 years of age was a dependent child
in the family unit, and
(b)
reached that age while attending secondary school,
the person is deemed to be a dependent child, for the purposes of this
section, until the earlier of
(c)
the end of the school year in which the person reaches the age of
19 years, and
(d)
the date the person stops attending secondary school.
(6)
For the purposes of this section, if the family unit includes a deemed
dependent child, the BC child adjustment amount applies in respect of
the deemed dependent child as if the deemed dependent child was a
dependent child.
Prorating of support allowance
3
In the calendar month that includes the income assistance application
date, the monthly support allowance is prorated based on the number of
days remaining in that calendar month, beginning with the date of that
submission.

(a)
the remortgaging was necessary because of the expiry of the mortgage
term, and
(b)
the amount borrowed under the mortgage is not increased.

(b)
beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
(4)

dividing the actual shelter costs for all the family units by the
number of persons occupying that place of residence, and
(ii)
multiplying the result by the number of persons in that one family
unit, and
(b)
the amount declared by the family unit as the shelter costs for that
