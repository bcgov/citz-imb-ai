two years of the completion of the road construction or deactivation
activity, revegetate the area or carry out other measures that will

(4)
The trees selected under subsection (1) must be distributed as evenly
as is practicable along all of the 100 m length of the stream unless
(a)
the area on the opposite side of that 100 m portion of the stream
meets the tree retention requirements of subsection (1), and
(b)
the tree species present on the area to be harvested are not suitable
for partial cutting silvicultural systems.
(5)
An owner or a contractor, employee or agent of the owner may remove a
tree that is otherwise required to be retained under subsections (1)
to (4) only if the tree falls by natural causes outside the stream
channel.
[am. B.C. Reg. 71/2014, s. 22.]
Retention of trees adjacent to class C streams
29
(1)
An owner or a contractor, employee or agent of the owner carrying out
timber harvesting activities in a cutblock adjacent to a class C
stream must, on each side of every 100 m of the stream that is
adjacent to the cutblock, retain at least 15 trees that
(a)
are within 10 m of the edge of the stream channel,
(b)
are 20 cm or more in diameter, and
(c)
maintain
(i)
the same proportion of coniferous to deciduous trees as in the
pre-harvest stand, and
(ii)
the same range of sizes, for both coniferous and deciduous trees, as
in the pre-harvest stand, if the gradient of the stream is 8% or less.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), if fewer than 15 trees meet the criteria set
out in that subsection, the owner or a contractor, employee or agent
of the owner is required to retain only those trees within that area
that meet the criteria in that subsection.
(3)
If the stream referred to in subsection (1) has a stream gradient of
more than 8%, the owner or a contractor, employee or agent of the
owner must not harvest a tree selected to be retained under subsection
(1) or (2) unless the owner or a contractor, employee or agent of the
owner selects and retains in its place another tree that is 20 cm or
greater in diameter.
(4)
If the stream referred to in subsection (1) has a stream gradient of
8% or less, the owner or a contractor, employee or agent of the owner
must not harvest a tree selected to be retained under subsection (1)
or (2) unless the tree falls by natural causes outside the stream
channel.
[am. B.C. Reg. 71/2014, s. 23.]
Retaining non-commercial trees and understory vegetation
30
(1)
An owner or a contractor, employee or agent of the owner carrying out
a primary forest activity must retain all non-commercial trees and
understory vegetation within
(a)
30 m of a class A stream,
(b)
30 m of a class B stream,
(c)
10 m of a class C stream,
(d)
10 m of a class D stream, and
(e)
10 m of a class E stream.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), an owner or a contractor, employee or agent of
the owner may
(a)
fall and remove non-commercial trees, or
(b)
disturb understory vegetation
if the falling and removal of the trees or the disturbance of the
vegetation
(c)
is necessary to enable the owner or a contractor, employee or agent of
the owner to comply with section 31,
(d)
is associated with a road constructed under section 16 or 17,
(e)
is associated with a logging trail constructed under section 17, or
(f)
will not cause a material adverse effect on fish habitat or water that
is diverted by a licensed waterworks intake.
[am. B.C. Reg. 71/2014, s. 24.]
Division 4 — Reforestation
Reforestation of areas where timber harvested or destroyed
31
(1)
In this section:
"completion of timber harvesting"
means the date that timber harvesting within a cutblock is concluded
and is determined by
(a)
the date the area is declared as a cutblock in an annual declaration,
or
(b)
if an area is not included in a declaration, a date that does not
exceed two consecutive operating seasons from the commencement of
harvesting in the cutblock;
"crop tree"
means a tree that
(a)
is of a commercial species that is consistent with the species of
trees specified in the management commitment for use in reforestation,
and
(b)
is unencumbered by pathogens;
"disturbed area"
means all or part of private managed forest land where
(a)
timber harvesting has been completed within a cutblock, or
(b)
timber was destroyed
but does not include an area occupied by roads referred to in section
13 or logging trails referred to in section 14 (1);
"restock"
means to establish a stand of trees that contains at least
(a)
400 crop trees per hectare reasonably well distributed across the
disturbed area if the stand is on the Coast, and
(b)
600 crop trees per hectare reasonably well distributed across the
disturbed area if the stand is in the Interior;
"successfully regenerated stand"
means a stand of trees
(a)
that contains at least
(i)
400 crop trees per hectare reasonably well distributed across the
disturbed area if the stand is on the Coast, and
(ii)
600 crop trees per hectare reasonably well distributed across the
disturbed area if the stand is in the Interior, and
(b)
where the crop trees exceed the height of competing vegetation within
1 m of the crop tree by
(i)
50% if the area is on the Coast, and
(ii)
25% if the area is in the Interior.
(2)
This section does not apply to an owner of a disturbed area if
(a)
the area where the timber was harvested or destroyed is a contiguous
area that is under 1 ha in size, or
(b)
the trees remaining on the area meet the definition of a successfully
regenerated stand.
(3)
If all or part of private managed forest land becomes a disturbed
area, an owner or a contractor, employee or agent of the owner must
reforest the disturbed area by
(a)
restocking the disturbed area within 5 years of the completion of
timber harvesting activity on the cutblock, or the date the timber was
destroyed, as applicable, and
(b)
establishing a successfully regenerated stand on the disturbed area
within 15 years of the completion of timber harvesting activity on the
cutblock, or the date the timber was destroyed, as applicable.
(4)-(5)
Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 55/2019, s. 7 (b).]
(6)
Nothing in this section requires an owner to reforest a disturbed area
if the timber on the area was
(a)
destroyed and the disturbed area is not sufficiently productive to
support a successfully regenerated stand, or
(b)
harvested or destroyed and the disturbed area becomes occupied by
buildings or other structures or installations.
[am. B.C. Regs. 71/2014, s. 25; 55/2019, s. 7.]
