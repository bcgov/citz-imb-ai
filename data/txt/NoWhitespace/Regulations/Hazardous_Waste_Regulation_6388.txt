4.13 discard the solid portion, if the weight is less than 0.5% (w/v) of The aliquot part taken and proceed to step 5.9. if not, proceed to step 5.1.
Note: for mixtures containing coarse grained solids, where separation Can be performed without imposing a 5 kg/cm 2 Differential pressure, a vacuum filtration unit with a filter bed as per Step 4.2 may be used. vacuum filtration must not be used if volatile Organic compounds are to be analysed.
(5) extraction procedure 5.1 prepare a solid sample for extraction by crushing, cutting or Grinding, to pass through a 9.5 mm mesh sieve. if the original sample Contains both liquid and solid phases, use the solid material from step 4.13. the structural integrity procedure, step 6, must be used for Monolithic wastes which are expected to maintain their structural Integrity in a landfill, (e.g. some slags and treated solidified Wastes).
Note: do not allow the solid waste material to dry prior to the Extraction step.

5.9 if the weight of the solid portion in step 4.1 was less than 0.5% (w/v), analyze the free liquid from step 4.13; otherwise, analyze the Combined solutions from step 5.8 for contaminants listed in table 1 of This schedule that are likely to be present.
5.10 report concentrations of contaminants in the combined leachate and The free liquid solution as mg/l.
(6) structural integrity procedure 6.1 this procedure may be required prior to extraction for some samples As indicated in step 5.1. it may be omitted for wastes with known high Structural integrity.
6.2 fill the sample holder with the material to be tested. if the sample Of the waste is a large monolithic block, cut a portion from the block Measuring 3.3 cm in diameter by 7.1 cm in length. for a treated waste (e.g. solidified waste) samples may be cast in a form with the above Dimensions for the purposes of conducting this test. in such cases, the Waste must be allowed to cure for 30 days prior to further testing.
6.3 place the sample holder in the structural integrity tester, then Raise the hammer to its maximum height and allow it to fall. repeat this Procedure 14 times.
6.4 remove the material from the sample holder, and proceed to step 5.2.
