For a taxation year, the actual value of land that is part of a
restricted-use property referred to in section 5 is one of the
following amounts, as applicable:
(a)
if, for the taxation year, the area of the land is smaller than the
area of land that was part of the restricted-use property when the
property was designated for the previous taxation year, the amount
determined in accordance with the following formula:
actual value =
current area
previous area
× PAV
× adjustment factor
where
current area
=
the area of the land that is part of the designated
restricted-use property for the taxation year;
previous area
=
the area of land that was part of the restricted-use property
when the property was designated for the previous taxation year;
PAV
=
the actual value, as set out on the assessment roll for the
previous taxation year, of the area of land that was part of the

that is part of the designated restricted-use property for the
taxation year is classified for that taxation year;
(b)
in any other case, the amount determined in accordance with the
following formula:

previous taxation year, of the area of land that was part of the
restricted-use property when the property was designated for
that previous taxation year;
adjustment factor
=
the adjustment factor for the property class in which the land
that is part of the designated restricted-use property for the
taxation year is classified for that taxation year;
new land value
=
the actual value, determined for the taxation year, in
accordance with the Act, of the land that is part of the
designated restricted-use property for the taxation year but
that was not part of the restricted-use property when the
property was designated for the previous taxation year.

(1)
For a taxation year, the actual value of the improvements or parts of
the improvements that are part of a restricted-use property referred
to in section 5 is the amount determined in accordance with the
following formula:
actual
value
=
PAV
continuing
−
PAV
former
− depreciation
×
adjustment
factor
+
new
improvement
value
where
PAV continuing
=
subject to subsection (4), the actual value, determined for the
previous taxation year, of all of the improvements, or parts of
them, that were part of the restricted-use property when the
property was designated for that previous taxation year and that
continue to be part of the designated restricted-use property
for the taxation year;
PAV former
=
the actual value, determined for the previous taxation year, of
all of the improvements, or parts of them, that were part of the
restricted-use property when the property was designated for
that previous taxation year but that are not part of the
designated restricted-use property for the taxation year;
depreciation
=
the amount determined for the taxation year, in accordance with
subsections (2) and (3), in relation to the designated
restricted-use property;
adjustment factor
=
the adjustment factor for the property class in which all of the
improvements, or parts of them, that are part of the designated
restricted-use property for the taxation year are classified for
the taxation year;
new improvement value
=
subject to subsection (4), the actual value, determined in
accordance with the Act, for the taxation year, of all of the
improvements, or parts of them, that are part of the designated
restricted-use property for the taxation year but that were not
part of the restricted-use property when it was designated for
the previous taxation year.
(2)
For the purposes of applying the formula set out in subsection (1),
depreciation for a taxation year is, in relation to a designated
restricted-use property, the total of all amounts each of which is an
amount of depreciation applicable to an improvement or part of an
improvement that is part of the designated restricted-use property,
determined as follows:
(a)
in the case of a berth improvement or part of a berth improvement, the
amount that is equal to 3% of the replacement cost of the improvement
or part;
(b)
in the case of any other improvement or part of an improvement, the
amount of depreciation, if any, determined by the assessor under
section 19 (3) of the Act.
(3)
Despite subsection (2) (a), the maximum amount of depreciation
applicable to a berth improvement or part of a berth improvement for a
taxation year is the amount that is equal to 60% of the replacement
cost of the improvement or part.
(4)
For the purposes of applying the formula set out in subsection (1) for
the first taxation year following the completion of construction of a
new single berth or double berth that is part of a designated
restricted-use property referred to in section 5,
(a)
the item in the formula described as PAV continuing must be reduced by
the actual value, determined for the previous taxation year, of the
berth improvements or parts of the berth improvements forming part of
the new berth, and
(b)
the item in the formula described as new improvement value must
include the following amount, as applicable, as if none of the berth
improvements or parts of the berth improvements forming part of the
new berth had been part of the restricted-use property when it was
designated for the previous taxation year:
(i)
in the case of a single berth, $640 000;
(ii)
in the case of a double berth, $2 700 000.
