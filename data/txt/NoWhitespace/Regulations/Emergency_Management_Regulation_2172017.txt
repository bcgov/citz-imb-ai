X h 1 000(glr + gvf) Where
V
= Maximum potential h 2 S release volume at standard conditions in cubic metres (m 3 ); Glr
= Produced gas-liquid ratio at maximum operating pressure (mop) (m 3 /m 3 ); Gvf
= Ratio of produced gas volume at standard conditions to the volume Of gas at mop (m 3 /m 3 ); V
Pl
= Volume of the pipeline in cubic metres (m 3 ); H
= Licensed h 2 S content (moles/kilomole) for the pipeline.
Gas multiphase pipeline h 2 S release volume The equation for calculating the maximum potential h 2 S release volume from a gas multiphase pipeline is as follows:
V = 0.785 x 10 -6 D
2 L
(glr x gvf) (glr + gvf) X h Where
V
= Maximum potential h 2 S release volume at standard conditions in cubic metres (m 3 ); D
= Internal diameter of pipeline in millimetres (mm); L
= Length of pipeline between emergency shutdown valves in kilometres (km); Glr
= Produced gas-liquid ratio at maximum operating pressure (mop) (m 3 /m 3 ); Gvf
= Ratio of produced gas volume at standard conditions to the volume Of gas at mop (m 3 /m 3 ); H
= Licensed h 2 S content (moles/kilomole) for the pipeline.
Chart c: pipeline distances Schedule d [am. b.c. reg. 226/2021, s. 11.] (section 10) Incident classification matrix The classification of an incident is determined for each event or Consequence in the following matrix by identifying the probability of Escalation or control of the event or consequence.
