Property tax rate cap on new investment in port facilities
2
New investment in improvements on property described in sections 4 (1)
(a) and (b) of the Act is subject to the maximum municipal tax rate
set out in section 4 (1) of the Act for the period set out in section
4 (4) of the Act, if the assessed value of the improvements is
included in an assessment roll for the 2005 or a subsequent taxation
year.
[am. B.C. Reg. 215/2014, s. 2.]
New investment in improvements
3
(1)
Subject to this section, for the purposes of section 4 of the Act, the
value of new investment in improvements, for the 2005 or a subsequent
taxation year, is the sum of the amounts determined by completing the
calculation set out in subsection (2) for
(a)
the current taxation year, and
(b)
the taxation year following the first year of designation and each of
the subsequent taxation years within the period up to the current
taxation year.
(2)
The amounts for the purposes of subsection (1) for the 2005 or a
subsequent taxation year are to be determined in accordance with the
following calculation:
(
AVI − AVIP
) − (
B − AVIP
)
where
AVI
= the assessed value of improvements for that year;
AVIP
= the assessed value of improvements for the previous year;
B
= the baseline value.
(3)
In determining an amount under subsection (2), if
(B − AVIP)
yields a negative number, the value to be used for
(B − AVIP)
is nil.
(4)
If an amount determined under subsection (2) is a negative number, the
amount for the purposes of the calculation is nil.
(5)
An amount determined under subsection (2) is to be adjusted for the
incremental change in the update factor and for depreciation by
multiplying that amount by the following:
[(
CU/DU
) (1 − 0.05
Y
)]
where
CU
= the current update factor;
DU
= the update factor in the first year of designation;
Y
= the number of years by which the taxation year for which the amount
is being determined under subsection (1) (a) or (b) precedes the
current taxation year.
(6)
Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 215/2014, s. 3 (b).]
(7)
If the value of new investment in improvements on property for any
taxation year, determined in accordance with this section, exceeds the
assessed value of taxable Class 4 improvements on the property
for that year, the value of new investment in improvements for the
purposes of section 4 of the Act for that year is the assessed value
of taxable Class 4 improvements.
