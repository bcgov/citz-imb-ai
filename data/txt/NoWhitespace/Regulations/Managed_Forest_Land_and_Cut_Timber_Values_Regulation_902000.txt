calendar year, in a form established by the assessment authority,
setting out the volume scaled under the
Forest Act
, by species and grade, for timber cut from within the area and, if
not scaled, an estimate of the volume, by species and grade, that
scaling would have determined had it been carried out.
(2)
The assessment authority may, following receipt and examination of a
return under subsection (1), request further information from the
owner and the owner must comply with that request.

but will not support coniferous tree species, must be valued at 50% of
the rate set out in Schedule B.
[am. B.C. Reg. 378/2004, s. 5.]
Determination of value — cut timber
5
(1)
The value of cut timber of appropriate species and grade must be

rates shown in the column headed "ungraded" for species and grade in
Schedule C, or the column headed "sawlog" in Schedule D as
appropriate.
(3)
The value of Grade Code 4 in an interior area must be set at 50% of
the sawlog value, and Grade Code 6 must be given a value of $1.00 per
cubic metre or such value as is determined from time to time by the
assessment authority.
