(a) The locations at which eligible premises are connected to the electric Distribution system; (b) The locations known to the authority at which unmetered buildings, Structures or equipment are connected to the electric distribution System;
(c) The locations of (i) Distribution transformers, (ii) Distribution circuit conductors, (iii) Substations,
(iv) System devices, and (v) Switches,
That are within the electric distribution system; (d) The locations of generators connected to the electric distribution System;
(e) The phase and direction of the electricity flowing through the Conductors referred to in paragraph (c); (f) Whether or which of the distribution circuit conductors connected to Switches referred to in paragraph (c) are energized; "electric distribution system" Means the equipment of the authority that is energized at less than 60 Kilovolts and is used by the authority to provide electricity at less Than 60 kilovolts; "electricity balance analysis" Means an analysis of the electricity in a portion of the electric Distribution system, including an analysis of the amount of Electricity that (a) Is measured by the smart meters at all eligible premises supplied from That portion, (b) Is measured by the system devices installed on that portion, (c) Is supplied from that portion to unmetered loads known to the Authority, and (d) Is lost in that portion because of resistance or another cause known To the authority; "eligible premises" Means a building, structure or equipment of a customer of the Authority if the building, structure or equipment is connected to the Electric distribution system and has an electricity meter, but does Not include a building, structure or equipment where it is Impracticable for the authority to install a smart meter; "in-home feedback device" Means a device that is capable of (a) Displaying
(i) A smart meter's measurements of electricity supplied to an eligible Premises, and (ii) The cost of the electricity measured by the smart meter, and (b) Transmitting information in digital form to and receiving information In digital form from a smart meter with which the authority has Established a secure telecommunications link; "system device" Means a device, including a distribution system meter and a sensor, That, when installed on the electric distribution system, is capable Of
(a) Measuring and recording measurements of electricity as frequently as Smart meters, (b) Transmitting and receiving information in digital form, (c) Measuring bi-directional flow of electricity, and (d) Being configured by the authority at a location either remote from or Close to the device.
[am. b.c. reg. 405/2012] Prescribed requirements for smart meters 2 For the purposes of the definition of "smart meter" in section 17 (1) Of the act, the prescribed requirements for a meter are that it is Capable of doing all of the following:
(a) Measuring electricity supplied to an eligible premises; (b) Transmitting and receiving information in digital form; (c) Allowing the authority remotely to disconnect and reconnect the supply Of electricity to an eligible premises, unless (i) The point of metering for the eligible premises (a) Is greater than 240 volts, (b) Is greater than 200 amperes, or (c) Is three phase, or (ii) The eligible premises (a) Has a bottom-connected meter, (b) Has an output or input pulse meter, or (c) Has a meter that measures maximum electricity demand in watts; (d) Recording measurements of electricity, and recording the date and time Of the recording, at least as frequently as in 60-minute intervals; (e) Being configured by the authority at a location either remote from or Close to the meter; (f) Measuring and recording measurements of electricity generated at the Premises and supplied to the electric distribution system; (g) Transmitting information to and receiving information from an in-home Feedback device, unless the point of metering for the eligible Premises meets any of the criteria set out in paragraph (c) (i) or the Eligible premises meets any of the criteria set out in paragraph (c) (ii).
Installation of smart meters and related equipment 3 (1) Subject to subsection (3), by the end of the 2012 calendar year, the Authority must install and put into operation (a) A smart meter for each eligible premises, and (b) All of the following related equipment:
(i) Communications infrastructure for transmitting information among smart Meters and the computer hardware and software systems described in Subparagraph (ii); (ii) Secure computer hardware and software systems that enable the Authority to do all of the following:
(a) Monitor, control and configure smart meters and the communications Infrastructure referred to in subparagraph (i); (b) Store, validate, analyze and use the information measured by and Received from smart meters; (c) Provide, through the internet, to a person who receives electricity From the authority secure access to information about the person's Electricity consumption and generation, if any, measured by a smart Meter;
(d) Establish a secure telecommunications link between in-home feedback Devices and smart meters that are compatible with each other; (e) Bill customers in accordance with rates that encourage the shift of The use of electricity from periods of higher demand to periods of Lower demand; (f) Integrate the systems with the authority's other business systems.
(2) The communications infrastructure referred to in subsection (1) (b) (i) must include a telecommunications network that is capable of Delivering two-way, digital, and secure communication.
(3) If it is impracticable because of distance, electromagnetic Interference, physical obstruction or other similar cause for the Authority to establish a telecommunications link between the smart Meter at an eligible premises and the computer hardware and software System referred to in subsection (1) (b) (ii), the authority is not Required to install or put into operation the communications Infrastructure referred to in subsection (1) (b) (i) for the purpose Of establishing that telecommunications link.
(4) The authority must integrate the operation of smart meters and related Equipment with the authority's other operations.
Smart grid 4 (1) The program required under section 17 (4) of the act must be Established by the end of the 2015 calendar year and include the Following components:
(a) The establishment and operation of a connectivity model and the Installation and operation of (i) At least 9 000 but no more than 35 000 system devices, and (ii) Computer hardware and software systems To enable the authority to (iii) Perform electricity balance analyses for the electric distribution System, and (iv) Estimate the amount of electricity supplied from a portion of the Electric distribution system to unmetered loads that are not known to The authority and to estimate the location of those loads; (b) The acquisition of investigation devices and computer software to Enable the authority to identify the location of the unmetered loads Referred to in paragraph (a) (iv); (c) The establishment and operation of telecommunications networks that (i) Have sufficient speed and bandwidth, and (ii) Enable two-way, digital, and secure communication among system Devices, automation-enabled devices and the systems and equipment used By the authority for monitoring and controlling its electric system To facilitate (iii) The operation of the authority's electric system, (iv) The integration, on a large scale, of distributed generation into the Electric distribution system, and (v) The provision of electricity service that allows for the large-scale Use of electric vehicles by its customers.
(2) The authority must integrate the operation of the smart grid with the Authority's other operations.
