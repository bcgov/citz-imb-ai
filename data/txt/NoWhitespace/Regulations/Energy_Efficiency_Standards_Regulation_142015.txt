Efficiency standard exemption for manufactured fenestration products
designed for specific buildings
25
For manufactured fenestration products, other than door slabs and
glazing products, that are designed for a specific building, if 2 or
more of the same type of manufactured fenestration products are
installed in the specific building, the applicable efficiency standard
for each manufactured fenestration product of that type may be met by
demonstrating that the average U-value, as determined by a designated
tester, of those manufactured fenestration products meets the
applicable efficiency standard.
Calculation of U-value for atypical manufactured fenestration products
26
For a manufactured fenestration product, other than a door slab or
glazing product, for which the U-value, by reason of its atypical
shape, size or other feature, cannot be determined by a designated
tester using standard testing procedures, the actual size of the
manufactured fenestration product may be used for calculating the
U-value of that manufactured fenestration product.
