[en. b.c. reg. 35/2021, s. 25.] Power management setting requirements for high expandability Computers, mobile workstations and workstations 76 (1) The power management settings for a high expandability computer, Mobile workstation or workstation must do both of the following:
(a) Within 30 minutes of user inactivity, transition the high Expandability computer, mobile workstation or workstation into (i) The computer off mode, or (ii) The computer sleep mode, which mode must meet the requirements set out In subsection (2) or (3), as applicable; (b) Within 15 minutes of user inactivity, transition displays connected to The high expandability computer, mobile workstation or workstation Into computer sleep mode.
(2) For a high expandability computer, mobile workstation or workstation To which acpi applies, the computer sleep mode must meet the Requirements applicable to "s3 sleeping state" in acpi.
(3) For a high expandability computer, mobile workstation or workstation To which acpi does not apply, the computer sleep mode must yield a Power consumption that does not exceed the amount, in watts, Determined in accordance with the following formula:
10 + 0.03 × c Where
C
= The greater of (a) the system memory capacity of the high expandability Computer, mobile workstation or workstation, in gigabytes, less 32 gigabytes, and (b) zero.
