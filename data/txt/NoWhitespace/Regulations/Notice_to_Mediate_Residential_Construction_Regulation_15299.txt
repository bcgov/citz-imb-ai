(2)
Despite subsection (1), a party referred to in that subsection may

attend one or both of a pre-mediation conference and a mediation
session by representative if
(i)
the party is under legal disability and the representative is that

the party is a resident of a jurisdiction other than British Columbia
and will not be in British Columbia at the time of the pre-mediation
conference or the mediation session, as the case may be.

A party or representative who attends a pre-mediation conference or a
mediation session may be accompanied by counsel.

or (iii) must be familiar with all relevant facts on which the
party, on whose behalf the representative attends, intends to rely and
must
(a)
if the party on whose behalf the representative attends is a
government body or a strata corporation, have access, at the earliest
practicable opportunity, to a person who has, or to a group of persons
who collectively have, full authority to settle on behalf of that
party, or
(b)
in any other case, have full authority to settle, or have immediate
access, during the mediation, to a person who has full authority to
settle, on behalf of the party on whose behalf the representative
attends.
Exemption from pre-mediation conference and mediation session
7
(1)
Parties to a residential construction action need not attend a
pre-mediation conference or a mediation session if all of the parties
to the action have already been involved in a mediation session in
relation to the matters in issue in that action.
(2)
A party need not attend a pre-mediation conference or a mediation
session if
(a)
the party is exempted from attending the pre-mediation conference or

the mediation proceed on the terms and conditions, if any, and at the
time or times, that the court considers appropriate,
(b)
the mediation be adjourned for the period or on the terms and
conditions that the court considers appropriate, or
(c)
one or more of the parties is exempt from attending one or both of a
pre-mediation conference and a mediation session if in the court's
opinion it is materially impracticable or unfair to require the party
to attend.
Scheduling of mediation session
9
(1)
A mediation session must occur within 150 days after the appointment
of the mediator unless a later specified date
(a)
is agreed on by all participants and that agreement is confirmed by
the mediator in writing, or
(b)
is ordered by the court.
(2)
On an application under subsection (1) (b) for an order that a
mediation session occur later than 150 days after the appointment
of the mediator, the court
(a)
must take into account all of the circumstances, including
(i)
whether a party intends to bring a motion for summary judgment or for
a special case,
(ii)
whether the mediation will be more likely to succeed if it is
postponed to allow the participants to acquire more information, and
(iii)
any other circumstances the court considers appropriate, and
(b)
may make an order referred to in section 8.
Pre-mediation disclosure of information
10
(1)

on any other specified basis agreed to by the participants.

participants.
(4)

declaration under this section precludes there being included in the
costs awarded to a party in the residential construction action an
amount to compensate the party for the share of the cost of the
mediation that that party paid under the declaration.
Conduct of a mediation
12

14
(1)
If a Declaration of Default is filed, the court may, on application
made on notice to the participant in respect of whom the Declaration
of Default is filed, do any one or more of the following unless that
participant satisfies the court that the default did not occur or that
there is a reasonable excuse for the default:
(a)
adjourn the application and order that a mediation session occur, on
any terms the court considers appropriate;
(b)
adjourn the application and order that the defaulting participant
attend one or both of a pre-mediation conference and a mediation

a Statement of Facts and Issues;

(e)
dismiss the proceeding or strike out the response to civil claim and

(f)
make any order it considers appropriate with respect to costs.

making any order about costs, whether that order is made following
final disposition of the action or otherwise.
[am. B.C. Reg. 154/2010, s. 4.]
