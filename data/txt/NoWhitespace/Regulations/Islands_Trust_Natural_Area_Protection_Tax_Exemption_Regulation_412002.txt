Tax exemption formula
3
A protection exemption is an exemption from tax on the land that is
subject to the protection covenant to the extent determined as
follows:
extent of exemption = 65% x (assessed value)
where
assessed value = the assessed value of the land that is subject
to the protection covenant.
Recapture amounts
4
(1)
The amount referred to in section 49.7 (2) (a) (i)
[base recapture amount]
of the Act is to be determined as follows:
base recapture amount = (final year exemption) x (years
exempt)
where
final year exemption =
the amount that, for the final year in which the protection
exemption applied, is determined as
(a) the tax that would have been payable had the exemption not
applied
minus
(b) the tax that was payable on the land that was subject to the
protection covenant;
years exempt =
the number of taxation years during which the land was subject
to the tax exemption.
(2)
The amount referred to in section 49.7 (2) (b) (i)
[interest amount]
of the Act is to be determined as follows:
interest recapture amount = (base recapture amount) x (rate)
where
base recapture amount =
the amount determined in accordance with subsection (1);
rate =
the rate applicable under section 245 (1) (b)
[taxes in arrear]
of the
Community Charter
at the time at which the exemption certificate was cancelled.
(3)
Amounts received under section 49.7 of the Act may be distributed by
the Minister of Finance to the trust council.
