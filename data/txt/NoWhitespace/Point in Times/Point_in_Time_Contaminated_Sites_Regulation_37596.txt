[en. b.c. reg. 343/2008, s. 11.] Summary of site condition Purpose of this summary of site condition This summary of site condition will serve several purposes. it will provide the ministry of environment (the ministry) with a summary of key information that will be used to understand the status of investigations and remediation, the nature and extent of remediation that is proposed or has been undertaken, further work that will be required, or closure documentation requested that is authorized by legislation and regulations in b.c. the summary of site condition will also provide information to persons with an interest in investigations and management of contaminants on or adjacent to a property or properties that are considered a site.
The information contained in this summary of site condition is provided by or on behalf of the british columbia ministry of environment to assist individuals to become familiar with conditions and issues at a site for which contaminant investigations and / or remediation have been carried out and reviewed under the guidance of the british columbia contaminated sites regulation (csr), the hazardous waste regulation (hwr), and the Environmental management act (ema).
It is emphasized that this is a summary only and should in no case be the sole basis for important decisions about the site. those with an interest in contaminant issues and the status of the site should seek more complete technical information as contained in site investigation, risk assessment, remediation plan and confirmation of remediation reports prepared by and signed by appropriately qualified individuals. firms and individuals that rely on the information contained herein do so entirely at their own risk.
Notes and instructions A summary of site condition is to be completed by the approved professional(s) making submission to the ministry of environment with application for a regulatory instrument (e.g. determination, approval in principle, contaminated soil relocation agreement or certificate of compliance).
This summary of site condition will provide ministry regulatory officials with much of the information on which they will evaluate the recommendation of an approved professional(s).
A separate summary of site condition is required for each service request submitted for a site.
All applicable parts of this summary of site condition and required attachments (e.g., site plan; site plan showing areas of potential environmental concern, and/or areas of environmental concern) must be completed and submitted or the summary will be returned and processing of any application(s) will be delayed.
If the summary of site condition is to accompany a recommendation by an approved professional that a service be provided as described in section 7.1 of the contaminated sites regulation, the following must also be submitted with the package:
[ ] a completed contaminated sites service application form [ ] a contaminated sites legal instrument cover letter (hard copy and electronic version) [ ] a completed draft contaminated sites legal instrument [ ] the applicable fees [ ] a signed summary of site condition (hard copy and electronic version with pdf format preferred).
Failure to accurately fill out the summary of site condition may result in delays issuing the legal instrument.

2. the site-specific factors of human intake of contaminated soil and toxicity to soil invertebrates and plants specified in this matrix apply at all sites.
3. intake pathway of exposure modeled is inadvertent ingestion of soil.
4. insufficient acceptable data exists, so standards are set equal to the canadian council of ministers of the environment 1999 provisional soil quality criteria.
5. the ph is the ph of the soil at a site.
6. standard has been adjusted based on a reference provincial background soil concentration. standard represents the rounded sum of the toxicologically-based value plus the reference provincial background soil concentration. for all land uses, the reference provincial background soil concentration is 108.6 μg/g.
