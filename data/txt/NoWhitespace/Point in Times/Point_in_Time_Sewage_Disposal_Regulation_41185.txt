[en. B.C. Reg. 11/92, s. 3.]
Operation of sewage disposal systems constructed or installed
under Code of Good Practice
6.2
(1)  The owner or an occupier of a parcel on which a sewage
disposal system is constructed or installed in accordance with a
permit issued under section 3.01 may use or operate the system
without obtaining an authorization under section 4, but the owner
or occupier must ensure that
(a) samples of the effluent are collected by a certified
laboratory
(i)  not later than 3, 6 then 12 months after the system
commences operation,

inspector is satisfied that it is impossible for a person to
comply with
(a) in the case of a conventional septic tank system,
sections 1, 16 or 22 of Schedule 2, or
(b) in the case of a conventional package treatment plant
system, sections 11, 12 or 18 of Schedule 3,
but that the person can comply with all other provisions of the
appropriate schedule, he may issue a permit to construct under
section 3, containing conditions that he considers appropriate to
meet the omitted standards having regard to safeguarding public
health.
(2)  Where a sewage disposal system, constructed or installed
prior to December 20, 1985 is in need of repair or alteration and
the appropriate work cannot reasonably be effected in accordance
with this regulation, the medical health officer or public health
inspector may issue a permit to repair or alter under section 3 if
the sewage disposal system, when repaired or altered in accordance
with the conditions contained in the permit, will not constitute a
health hazard.
(3)  This section does not apply to a sewage disposal system
within an environmental control zone.
[am. B.C. Regs. 199/86, s. 5; 11/92, s. 4.]
Jurisdiction of local board
8
A local board has jurisdiction to control discharges of effluent
to tidal water, and may, with the approval of the Provincial
health officer, by order
(a) fix or set minimum distances which must exist between
high water mark and any part of a sewage disposal system, and
(b) prohibit discharges to tidal water in circumstances where
discharge may constitute a health hazard.
[am. B.C. Reg. 199/86, s. 6.]
Offence

PLEASE NOTE: in the following schedules Imperial measurements
are added editorially for convenience and are not exact
measurements.
Schedule 1
Site Investigation
1
The obligations on an owner before applying for a permit to
construct or install under section 3 (2) or section 3.01, are as
follows:
(a) determination of the subsurface ground conditions in the
area of the absorption field by digging or boring a representative
number of holes to a minimum depth of 1.2 m [4 ft.], report the
conditions found, leave the excavated material for inspection and
cover the test holes;
(b) determination of the suitability of the soil to absorb
effluent by conducting percolation tests as follows:
(i)  percolation test holes must be made at points and
elevations selected as typical in the area of the proposed
absorption field;
(ii)  test holes must be dug at each end of the area of the
absorption field. Further holes may be required, depending upon
the nature of the soil, the results of the first tests and the
size of the proposed absorption field;
(iii)  test holes must be 30 cm [12 in.] square and excavated
to the proposed depth of the absorption field;
(iv)  to make the percolation test more accurate, any smeared
soil should be removed from the walls of the test holes;
(v)  if the soil contains considerable amounts of silt or
clay, the test holes must be presoaked before proceeding with the
test. Presoaking is accomplished by keeping the hole filled with
water for 4 hours or more. The test must be carried out
immediately after presoaking;
(vi)  to undertake the test, fill the test hole with water.
When the water level is 13 cm [5 in.] or less from the bottom of
the hole, refill the hole to the top. No recording of time need be
done for these 2 fillings;
(vii)  when the water level, after the second filling
(procedure (vi)) is 13 cm [5 in.] or less from the bottom of the
hole, add enough water to bring the depth of water to 15 cm [6
in.] or more;
(viii)  observe the water level until it drops to the 15 cm
[6 in.] depth, at precisely 15 cm [6 in.], commence timing, when
the water level reaches the 12.5 cm [5 in.] depth, stop timing,
record the time in minutes;
(ix)  repeat procedures (vii) and (viii) until the last 2
rates of fall do not vary more than 2 minutes per 2.5 cm [per
inch];
(x)  Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 11/92, s. 2.]
(xi)  determine the percolation rate for the proposed sewage
disposal system by averaging the slowest rate determined for each
of the test holes;
(xii)  backfill the holes with the excavated soil and flag
their locations.
[am. B.C. Regs. 11/92, s. 2; 382/95, s. 9.]
2
The ground water table shall be determined as follows:
(a) Where, in the opinion of the medical health officer or
public health inspector, a ground water table may be affected by
infiltration from a body of surface water at the time the
elevation of the body of surface water is at its high water mark,
the elevation of the ground water table shall be deemed to be the
same as the elevation of the high water mark of the body of
surface water from which the infiltration is expected to occur.
(b) Where the ground water table is not affected by
infiltration from a body of surface water as described in
paragraph (a), the ground water table shall be the average of the
2 maximum recorded seasonal ground water tables in the 24 month
period immediately prior to the date of application. The records
considered for this calculation shall be those acceptable to the
medical health officer or public health inspector.
(c) In situations where
(i)  no records are available, or
(ii)  there is a probability of flooding or a high water
table
the medical health officer or public health inspector may
determine the ground water table.
[am. B.C. Reg. 199/86, s. 7.]
3
(1)  The applicant for a permit shall report the results of
all determinations made under this schedule in a manner and form
satisfactory to the Ministry of Health.
(2)  If the results reported under subsection (1) are unable
to satisfy the medical health officer or public health inspector
that the quality of the surface water and ground water will not be
impaired, the medical health officer or public health inspector
may require that alternative or additional tests be carried out by
or on behalf of the applicant for a permit, so as to ensure that
proper surface and ground water quality will be maintained.
Schedule 2

system has at least 70 cm of undisturbed, natural, porous soil
beneath the trench containing the drainage pipe, and complies with
(i)  the minimum distances specified in Table 1, or
(ii)  the modified minimum distances specified in section 3
of this Schedule, or
(b) in the case of an on site phosphorus reduction sewage
disposal system, the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection
has verified that the system is capable of continuously removing
at least 80% of the initial concentration of phosphorus
