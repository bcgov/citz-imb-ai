(e) What is Material?
Would a reasonable investor's decision to buy, sell or hold

the information in question was omitted or misstated? If so, the
information is material. This concept of materiality is consistent
with the financial reporting notion of materiality contained in the
Handbook. In determining whether information is material, take into
account both quantitative and qualitative factors.
(f) Terminology
All references to "net assets" or "net assets per security" in this
Form are references to net assets determined in accordance with
Canadian GAAP as presented in the financial statements of the
investment fund. All references to "net asset value" or "net asset
value per security" in this Form are references to net asset value
determined in accordance with Part 14 of the Instrument.
Investment funds must use net assets as shown on the financial
statements in the "The Fund's Net Assets per [Unit/Share]" table.
All other calculations for the purposes of the MRFP must be made
using net asset value.

(1) This information is provided as at [insert date of
end of financial year] of the year shown.
(2) Management expense ratio is based on total expenses
(excluding commissions and other portfolio transaction
costs) for the stated period and is expressed as an
annualized percentage of daily average net asset value
during the period.
(3) The trading expense ratio represents total
commissions and other portfolio transaction costs expressed
as an annualized percentage of daily average net asset value
during the period.
(4) The Fund's portfolio turnover rate indicates how
actively the Fund's portfolio adviser manages its portfolio
investments. A portfolio turnover rate of 100% is equivalent
to the Fund buying and selling all of the securities in its
portfolio once in the course of the year. The higher a
fund's portfolio turnover rate in a year, the greater the
trading costs payable by the fund in the year, and the
greater the chance of an investor receiving taxable capital
gains in the year. There is not necessarily a relationship
between a high turnover rate and the performance of a fund.
