The ph is the ph of the soil at a site.
36.
Standard has been adjusted based on a reference provincial Background soil concentration. standard represents the rounded Sum of the toxicologically-based value plus the reference Provincial background soil concentration. for all land uses, The reference provincial background soil concen-tration is 108.6 µg/g.
37.
Ns - no standard. insufficient acceptable scientific data Exists, so no standard is calculated.
Notes to table 6 38.
All values are in µg/g unless otherwise stated. substances Must be analyzed using methods specified in protocols approved Under section 53 of the contaminated sites regulation, b.c.
Reg. 375/96, or alternate methods acceptable to the director.
39.
The site-specific factors of human intake of contaminated soil And toxicity to soil invertebrates and plants specified in This matrix apply at all sites.
40.
Intake pathway of exposure modeled is inadvertent ingestion of Soil.
41.
Ns - no standard. insufficient acceptable scientific data Exists, so no standard is calculated.
42.
Standard is set equal to the canadian council of ministers of The environment, 1999 - nutrient and energy cycling check Value

Standard is set equal to the canadian council of ministers of The environment, 1999 - nutrient and energy cycling check Value.
49.
Standard varies with receiving water hardness (h). h = 100 - < 200 mg/l as caco3 is assumed.
Schedule 10.1 was enacted by bc reg 243/2016 (as amended by bc reg 195/2017), effective november 1, 2017.
Schedule 12 table items "manure" and "plant matter derived from Processing plants" before amended by bc reg 7/2019, effective February 28, 2019.
Manure
Animal excreta from pets, animals in zoological facilities, Fish held in commercial aquaculture or aquarium facilities, Livestock, farmed game or poultry, this does not include the Management of animal excreta (manure) on farms as defined as Agricultural waste in b.c. reg. 131/92 but does include animal Excreta (manure) not included within the scope of b.c. reg.
131/92.
Plant matter derived from processing plants Fruit, vegetable and vegetative material derived from fruit And vegetable processing plants, these are materials which Have been removed from an agricultural operation and no longer Fit within the definition of agricultural waste (agricultural Vegetation waste) as defined in b.c. reg. 131/92.
