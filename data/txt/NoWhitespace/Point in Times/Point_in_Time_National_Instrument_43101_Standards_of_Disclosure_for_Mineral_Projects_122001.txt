Part 2 - Requirements Applicable to All Disclosure
Requirements Applicable to All Disclosure
2.1
An issuer shall ensure that all disclosure of a scientific or
technical nature, including disclosure of a mineral resource or
mineral reserve, concerning mineral projects on a property
material to the issuer is based upon a technical report or other
information prepared by or under the supervision of a qualified
person.
All Disclosure of Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves
2.2
An issuer shall ensure that any disclosure of a mineral resource
or mineral reserve, including disclosure in a technical report
filed by an issuer
(a) utilizes only the applicable mineral resource and mineral
reserve categories set out in sections 1.3 and 1.4;
(b) reports each category of mineral resources and mineral
reserves separately, and if both mineral resources and mineral
reserves are disclosed, states the extent, if any, to which
mineral reserves are included in total mineral resources; and
(c) does not add inferred mineral resources to the other
categories of mineral resources.
Prohibited Disclosure
2.3
(1)  An issuer shall not make any disclosure of
(a) quantity or grade of a deposit which has not been
categorized as an inferred mineral resource, an indicated mineral
resource, a measured mineral resource, a probable mineral reserve
or a proven mineral reserve, or
(b) results of an economic evaluation which uses inferred
mineral resources.
(2)  Despite paragraph (1) (a), an issuer may disclose in
writing the potential quantity and grade, expressed as ranges, of
a possible mineral deposit that is to be the target of further
exploration, provided that the disclosure includes
(a) a proximate statement that the potential quantity and
grade is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient
exploration to define a mineral resource on the property and that
it is uncertain if further exploration will result in discovery of
a mineral resource on the property, and
(b) the basis on which the disclosed potential quantity and
grade has been determined.
(3)  Despite paragraph (1) (b), an issuer may disclose a
preliminary assessment that includes an economic evaluation which
uses inferred mineral resources, provided
(a) the preliminary assessment is a material change in the
affairs of the issuer or a material fact;
(b) the disclosure includes
(i)  a proximate statement that the preliminary assessment is
preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral resources
that are considered too speculative geologically to have the
economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to
be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that
the preliminary assessment will be realized, and
(ii)  the basis for the preliminary assessment and any
qualifications and assumptions made by the qualified person; and
(c) in Ontario, if the issuer is a reporting issuer in
Ontario, the issuer shall deliver to the regulator in Ontario the
disclosure it proposes to make together with the preliminary
assessment and the technical report required pursuant to section
4.2 at least five business days prior to making the disclosure and
the regulator in Ontario shall not have advised the issuer that it
objects to the disclosure.
(4)  An issuer shall not use the terms preliminary
feasibility study, pre-feasibility study or feasibility study when
referring to a study unless the study satisfies the criteria set
out in the definitions of the applicable terms in section 1.2.
Disclosure of Historical Estimates
2.4
Despite section 2.2 an issuer may disclose an estimate of mineral
resources or mineral reserves made before this Instrument came
into force if
(a) the estimate is an estimate of mineral resources or
mineral reserves prepared by or on behalf of a person or company
other than the issuer, or
(b) the estimate accompanies disclosure of an estimate of
mineral resources and mineral reserves made in accordance with
section 2.2
and provided that the disclosure:
(i)  identifies the source of the historical estimate;
(ii)  confirms that the historical estimate is relevant;
(iii)  comments on the reliability of the historical
estimate;
(iv)  states whether the historical estimate uses categories

the issuer.

INSTRUCTIONS
(1) The objective of the technical report is to provide
scientific and technical information concerning mineral
exploration, development and production activities on a mineral
property that is material to an issuer. This Form sets out
specific requirements for the preparation and contents of a
technical report. Item 25 of this Form includes additional
requirements for technical reports on development and production
properties.
(2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or
interpreted in National Instrument 43-101 Standards of
Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the "Instrument") shall bear
that definition or interpretation. In particular, the terms
"mineral resource" and "mineral reserve" and the categories of
each are defined in the Instrument. In addition, a general
definition instrument has been adopted as National Instrument
14-101 Definitions which contains definitions of certain terms
used in more than one national instrument. Readers of this Form
shall review both these national instruments for defined terms.
(3) The author preparing the technical report shall use the
headings of the Items in this Form. If unique or infrequently
used technical terms are required, clear and concise
explanations shall be included.
(4) No disclosure need be given in respect of inapplicable items
and, unless otherwise required by this Form, negative answers to
items may be omitted. Disclosure included under one heading is
not required to be repeated under another heading.
(5) The technical report is not required to include the
information required in Items 6 through 11 of this Form to the
extent that the required information has been previously filed
in a report for the property being reported on, the previous
report is referred to in the technical report and there has not
been any change in the information.
