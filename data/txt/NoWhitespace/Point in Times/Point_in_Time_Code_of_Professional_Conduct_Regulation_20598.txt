Disciplinary or corrective measures

(1)  After finding that a disciplinary default has occurred,

(h) written reprimand;
(i) verbal reprimand.
(2)  If the discipline authority considers that one or more
disciplinary or corrective measures are necessary, an approach
that seeks to correct and educate the police officer concerned
takes precedence over one that seeks to blame and punish, unless
the approach that should take precedence is unworkable or would
bring the administration of police discipline into disrepute.
(3)  If the discipline authority considers that one or more
disciplinary or corrective measures are necessary, the discipline
authority must choose the least onerous disciplinary or corrective
measures in relation to the police officer concerned unless one or
both of the following would be undermined:
(a) organizational effectiveness of the municipal police
department with which the police officer is employed;
(b) public confidence in the administration of police
discipline.
(4)  Aggravating and mitigating circumstances must be
considered in determining just and appropriate disciplinary or
corrective measures for a breach of this Code by a police officer
of a municipal police department, including, without limitation,
(a) the seriousness of the breach,
(b) the police officer's record of employment as a police
officer, including, without limitation, his or her service record
of discipline, if any, and any other current record concerning
past discipline defaults,
(c) the impact of proposed disciplinary and corrective
measures on the police officer and on the police officer's career
and family,
(d) the likelihood of future breaches of this Code by the
police officer,
(e) whether the police officer accepts responsibility for the
breach and is willing to take steps to prevent a recurrence of the
breach,
(f) the degree to which the municipal police department's
policies, standing orders or internal procedures or the actions of
the police officer's supervisor contributed to the breach,
(g) the range of disciplinary or corrective measures imposed
in similar circumstances, if known, and
(h) other aggravating or mitigating factors.
(5)  Nothing in this Code prevents a chief constable or a
municipal police board from doing one or both of the following:
(a) issuing an apology on behalf of the municipal police
department concerned or, with the consent of the police officer
concerned, on behalf of both the department and the police
officer;
(b) considering, proposing or implementing policy changes
designed to prevent recurrence of a breach of this Code.
