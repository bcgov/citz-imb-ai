Schedule 2
[am. b.c. reg. 321/2004, s. 21 (c).] Determination of total extractable hydrocarbon (section 3 (4)) Sampling protocol 1 (1) Effluent samples for the determination of total extractable Hydrocarbons must be obtained as follows:
(a) If possible, the sample must be obtained at the point that the Effluent exits the treatment facility and enters the environment; (b) If it is not possible to comply with paragraph (a), the sample Must be obtained from the subsurface liquid in the separator as Close as is practical to the point where the effluent enters the Outlet pipe; (c) If there is any other configuration of effluent discharge where (a) and (b) above are not practical, the sampling method must be Acceptable to a director.
(2) All equipment which comes into contact with the sample must before The sample is obtained be decontaminated by (a) Rinsing the equipment with de-ionized water, (b) Rinsing the equipment with 2-propanol, (c) Scrubbing the equipment with laboratory grade detergent, and (d) Triple rinsing the equipment with de-ionized water.
(3) All samples of subsurface liquid must be obtained using a sampling Device which (a) Allows a person to obtain a sample of effluent from below the Surface of a separator without contaminating the sample with Material at the surface of the separator, and (b) Is decontaminated as set out in subsection (2).
(4) Samples must be stored in only one container from the time they Are taken to the time they are delivered to a laboratory for Analysis.
(5) Samples must be preserved by adding sufficient acid to the sample Immediately after obtaining it to cause the ph of the sample/acid Mixture to be less than 2.
(6) Samples must be transferred immediately to a cooler after they are Taken and stored as close as possible to 4 degrees centigrade Without freezing the sample until they are delivered to a Laboratory for analysis.
Total extractable hydrocarbon analysis method 2 The analytical method to be used in the determination of total Extractable hydrocarbons is described in "test methods for Evaluating solid waste", third edition, 1986, sw-846, methods 3510/8000a, published by the u.s. environmental protection agency; And using extraction with methylene chloride, volume reduction, And analysis by capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization Detection.
