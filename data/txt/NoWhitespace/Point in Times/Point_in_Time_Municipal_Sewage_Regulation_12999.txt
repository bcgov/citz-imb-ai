2 for estuaries, the stream flow is the fresh water content.
3 if the dilution ratio is less than 100:1 the environmental impact Study must determine if effluent quality needs to be better than That shown in schedule 3. if the dilution ratio is below 40:1 and The receiving stream is used for recreational or domestic water Extraction within the influence of the discharge or for seasonal Discharge, discharge is not authorized unless an environmental Impact study shows that the discharge is acceptable, and, in the Opinion of a director, no other solutions are available and written Authorization from the director is obtained. for seasonal discharges Or where the receiving stream is not used for recreational or Domestic water extraction, the director may in writing authorize a Minimum dilution ratio of 20:1 for column a. discharge is prohibited If the dilution ratio is less than 10:1.
4 treatment and effluent quality requirements are determined by Daily flow multiples which require secondary treatment for all flows Up to and equaling 2.0 times the adwf. as set out in condition 17 to Schedule 1, a liquid waste management plan or specific study and Implemented measures are required if flows exceed 2.0 times adwf During a storm or equivalent snowmelt event with a less than 5-year Return period. in the interim, if flows exceed 2.0 times adwf, a Lesser standard of treatment may be allowed for existing discharges, But must not be less than primary. for areas of the province where Permafrost or freezing ground conditions require, in accordance with A practice approved by the local building inspector or equivalent, Connection of roof drains to the sanitary sewer system, a director May, in writing, increase the factor from 2.0 times to a maximum of 3.0 times.
5 all outfalls must be marked on shore with an appropriate sign.
Information required is the length and depth of the outfall. the Minimum size of the sign is 1.0 m 2 And the colours of the lettering and the background must contrast Sufficiently with each other that the wording is clearly visible.
The sign must be visible from both water and land. the wording on The sign must be to the satisfaction of a director.
6 the discharger must also ensure that requirements of schedule 5 Are met, if applicable.
7 see requirements of schedule 5.
8 the allowable number of fecal coliform organisms in the effluent Is dependent on the use of the receiving water. for discharges to Shellfish bearing waters the number of fecal coliform organisms at The edge of the initial dilution zone must be less than 14/100 ml ("the median number of fecal coliform organisms in a water sample Does not exceed 14/100 ml, with not more than 10% of the samples Exceeding 43/100 ml", from "canadian shellfish sanitation program, Manual of operations"). for discharges to recreational use waters The number of fecal coliform organisms at the edge of the initial Dilution zone must be less than 200/100 ml. where domestic water Extraction occurs within 300 meters of a discharge the median number Of fecal coliform organisms must be less than 2.2/100 ml in the Effluent with no sample exceeding 14/100 ml. the geometric mean, as Determined from the bacteriological results of the last 5 samples For which analyses have been completed over the last 30 days, must Not exceed the coliform limits specified, and for this purpose, "geometric mean" Means the anti-logarithm of a calculation in which the logarithms of A series of numerical measures are summed and divided by the number Of numerical measures.
9 septic tank treatment requires a hydraulic capacity of at least 2 Days minimum detention time at the design maximum daily flow. an Effluent filter, screen or equivalent measures to protect pumps and Prevent discharge of solids and floatables is required. for small, Remote, seasonal discharges a director may waive the requirement for An effluent filter.
10 the total and ortho phosphorus criteria may be waived, by a Director in writing, if it can be shown by an environmental impact Study that receiving waters would not be subject to an undesirable Degree of increased biological activity because of the phosphorus Addition. alternatively, an environmental impact study may show that Lower effluent concentrations than are tabulated are necessary, or That a mass load criteria may be needed.
11 if required to satisfy section 8 of this regulation.
12 the maximum allowable effluent ammonia concentration at the "end Of pipe" must be determined from a back calculation from the edge of The initial dilution zone. the back calculation must consider the Ambient temperature and ph characteristics of the receiving water And known water quality guidelines.
13 for lagoon systems, the maximum tss level must not exceed 60 Mg/l.
