Principles for governmental relations
3
The relationship between regional districts and the Provincial government in relation to this Act is based on the following principles:
(a)
cooperative relations between the Provincial government and regional districts are to be fostered in order to efficiently and effectively meet the needs of the citizens of British Columbia;
(b)
regional districts need the powers that allow them to draw on the resources required to fulfill their responsibilities;
(c)
notice and consultation is needed for Provincial government actions that directly affect regional district interests;
(d)
the Provincial government recognizes that different regional districts and their communities have different needs and circumstances and so may require different approaches;
(e)
the independence of regional districts is balanced by the responsibility of the Provincial government to consider the interests of the citizens of British Columbia generally.
Broad interpretation
4
(1)
The powers conferred on regional districts and their boards under this Act must be interpreted broadly in accordance with the purposes of this Act and in accordance with regional district purposes.
(2)
If
(a)
an enactment confers a specific power on a regional district or board in relation to a matter, and
(b)
the specific power can be read as coming within a general power conferred under this Act,

General principles of replotting
986
(1)
For the purpose of a replotting scheme, all the parcels and highways and all other real property in the district at the initiation of the scheme form one common mass of real property.
(2)
From the common mass is to be taken the real property necessary for highways, parks or public squares, which stands in the place of and compensates the Provincial government, the municipality and the public for the surrender of all former highways, parks or public squares.
(3)
The remainder of the common mass must be divided into parcels for allotment to the owners in a fair and equitable manner, so that as far as possible the value of new parcels allotted to them are equal to the value of their former parcels.
(4)
An allotment, decision, award, consent or other proceeding under this Part is binding on and inures to the benefit of the person who owns the real property affected.
Reallotment of parcels
987
(1)
In a replotting,
(a)
effort must be made to allot to owners new parcels in approximately the same location as their former parcels, and
(b)
parcels with buildings, structures, erections or utilities erected on them, subject to the necessary adjustment of boundaries, must be returned to their former owners wherever practicable.
(2)
The allotment of new parcels in exchange for former parcels must be carried out as far as practicable with the consent of the respective owners.
(3)
Failing consent of an owner, there may be allotted to the owner a new parcel or parcels of value equal as nearly as possible to the value of the owner's former parcel or parcels, or compensation in money may be made to the owner instead of an allotment of real property.
(4)
Unavoidable differences of value between former parcels and new parcels may be equalized by
(a)
granting money compensation, or
(b)
with the owner's consent or agreement, allotting to the owner of a new parcel of greater value than the owner's former parcel for a cash payment or on terms.
(5)
If a new parcel is allotted under subsection (4) (b) on terms, the municipality may take a mortgage, with agreed interest, from the owner for payment of the difference in value.
(6)
Any real property not allotted as provided above may be allotted to any owner at an agreed price, the amount of which must be paid to the municipality.
(7)
The whole of the real property remaining unallotted must be allotted to the municipality and is surplus real property.
Municipality may acquire charges
988
Subject to making compensation for a charge against a former parcel, the municipality may
(a)
acquire such a charge and hold it as a charge against a new parcel allotted to the owner of the former parcel, and
(b)
take all necessary proceedings for the collection of the amount due under and by virtue of the charge or for the sale, transfer or realization of the security created by it.

General consent of owners to scheme
990
(1)
The council may, by resolution, authorize the initiation of the replotting scheme without further consent by other owners in the district if the owners of parcels of real property, the assessed land value of which is at least 70% of the total assessed value of all the land in the district according to the last revised real property assessment roll, consent to the replotting set out in the scheme.
(2)
A consent referred to in subsection (1) must be in writing in the form referred to in section 989 (2) (e).

the parcel has been purchased at a tax sale and the period for redemption has not expired;
(c)
in the cases of parcels of real property held subject to one or more charges,

the value of the charges and of the estate in fee simple must be determined by multiplying the assessed value of the land by the true or market value of the particular interest in the parcel and dividing the resulting product by the true or market value of the parcel, and
(ii)
if the true or market values of an interest in real property cannot be determined from the information supplied by owners of a parcel under section 989 (2) (e), the designated municipal officer must assess and determine the values for the purposes of subparagraph (i) from whatever records or information are available to that municipal officer;
(d)
if a parcel of real property is held by a tenant for life,
(i)
the true or market value of the life estate is its present worth as determined by using the official Statistics Canada Tabulations of British Columbia life expectancy in effect when the valuation is made, and
(ii)
the true or market value of the estate in remainder in fee simple is the resulting balance, after subtracting the true or market value of the life estate from the true or market value of the parcel;
(e)
in the cases of multiple ownership of estates in fee simple and charges,
(i)
each tenant in common must be considered to consent to the proportion of the whole estate in fee simple or charge held by the tenant's proportion in the tenancy, and

For an assessment averaging option, tax rates may be imposed on the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:
Amount = averaged land value + assessed improvements value

assessed improvements value
=
the assessed value of improvements in the current year.

Amount = (assessed land value – phasing reduction) + assessed improvements value
where
assessed land value
=
the assessed value of the land in the current year;
phasing reduction
=
the phasing percentage established by the bylaw, being not less than 50% and not more than 66%, of the difference between
(a)
the increase in the assessed value of the land in the current year from the previous year, and
(b)
the assessed value of the land in the previous year multiplied by the average percentage increase in the assessed value from the previous year to the current year of all land within the municipality included in the same property class;
assessed improvements value
=

(a) a body other than the council sets a rate under an enactment for calculating property taxes, and
(b) the council adopts a bylaw imposing tax rates under this section,
then, despite any other Act, the council must, by resolution, substitute a rate that is sufficient to raise the same amount of revenue in the municipality for that body from each property class to which that bylaw applies as the amount that would have been raised for that body had that bylaw not been adopted.
