who assents to the compromise, or
(b)
the absent person or member of the class is represented by a
person appointed under subrule (14) who so assents,

benefit of the absent person or member of the class and that it is

representatives without joining a person having a beneficial

order granted or made in the proceeding is binding on that person.

person having an interest to be made a party or to make an order
under subrule (14).
Representation of deceased person interested in a proceeding
(19)
Where the estate of a deceased person has an interest in a matter
in question in a proceeding, but there is no personal
representative, the court may proceed in the absence of a person
representing the estate of the deceased person or may appoint a
person to represent the estate for the purposes of the proceeding,
and an order made or granted in the proceeding binds the estate to
the same extent as it would have been bound had a personal
representative of the deceased person been a party to the
proceeding.

notice of the application to be given to a person having an
interest in the estate.

bare denial of it by the opposite party shall be construed only as
a denial of fact of the express contract, promise or agreement
alleged, or of the matters of fact from which it may be implied by
law, and not as a denial of the legality or sufficiency in law of
that contract, promise or agreement.
Allegation of malice
(23)
It is sufficient to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge
or other condition of the mind of a person as a fact, without
setting out the circumstances from which it is to be inferred.

Rule 62 — Administration of Estates (Contentious)
Interpretation
(1)
In this rule "probate action" means an action for the grant of
probate of the will of, or letters of administration of the estate
of, a deceased person, or for the revocation of a grant or for an
order pronouncing for or against the validity of an alleged
testamentary paper, but does not include a proceeding governed by
Rule 61.
Dispute as to the validity of a testamentary paper
(2)
In an action where the validity of a testamentary paper is
questioned, all persons having an interest in upholding or
disputing its validity shall be joined as defendants.
Commencement of action
(3)
A probate action shall be commenced by writ of summons, and the
endorsement on the writ, or the statement of claim if it is set
out in the writ, shall contain a statement of the interest of the
plaintiff and of each defendant in the estate of the deceased.
Parties
(4)
Each person who is entitled or claims to be entitled to administer
the estate of a deceased person under or by virtue of an unrevoked
grant of probate or letters or administration must be made a party
to any action for revocation of the grant, and by leave of the
court, a person interested in the estate, but not named as a
defendant, may enter an appearance and defend the action as though
the person were a defendant.
Action for revocation of grant
(5)
In an action for the revocation of a grant of probate or
administration,
(a)
if the action is commenced by a person to whom the grant was made,
the person shall lodge the grant with the registrar within 7 days
after the issue of the writ, or
(b)
if a defendant to the action has the grant in his possession or
under his control, the defendant shall lodge it with the registrar
within 7 days after the service of the writ upon him,
and the person to whom the grant was issued shall not act under it
without leave of the registrar.
Failure to lodge grant on action for revocation
(6)
Where a person fails to comply with subrule (5), the registrar may
issue a citation in Form 85 calling on the person to bring the
grant into the registrar's office, and a person against whom the
citation is issued shall not take any step in the action without
leave of the court until the person has complied with the
citation.
Failure to enter appearance
(7)
Rule 17 does not apply to a probate action, and if a defendant
fails to enter an appearance within the time allowed, the
plaintiff may proceed with the action on serving a statement of
claim.
Counterclaim
(8)
A defendant to a probate action who alleges that he or she has a
claim or is entitled to relief or a remedy in respect of a matter
relating to the grant of probate or letters of administration
shall deliver a counterclaim in respect of that claim, relief or
remedy.
Failure to serve statement of claim
(9)
Where the plaintiff fails to serve a statement of claim, a
defendant may, with the leave of the court, deliver a
counterclaim, and the action shall then proceed as if the
defendant were the plaintiff.
Defence limited to proof in solemn form
(10)
In a probate action, a statement of defence may state that the
defendant merely requires that the will be proved in solemn form,
and that the defendant only intends to cross-examine the witnesses
produced in support of the will, and in that event the defendant
is not liable for costs, unless the court determines that there
was no reasonable ground for requiring proof in solemn form.
Certain rules not to apply
(11)
Rules 25 (1), (2), (3), (12), (13) and 36 do not apply to a
probate action.
Order for discontinuance or dismissal
(12)
At any stage of a probate action the court may order the action to
be discontinued or dismissed, and may order that a grant of
probate or administration be made to the person entitled.
Compromise
(13)
No probate action shall be compromised without leave of the court.
Rule 63 — Crown Practice Rules in Civil Matters
Originating application
(1)
Applications for relief in the nature of mandamus, prohibition,
certiorari or habeas corpus are governed by these rules and must
be commenced by petition under Rule 10.
Writs abolished
(2)
No writ of mandamus, prohibition, certiorari or habeas corpus
shall be issued, but all necessary directions shall be made by
order.
Person affected may take part in proceeding
(3)
The court may order that a person who may be affected by a
proceeding for an order in the nature of mandamus may take part in
the proceeding to the same extent as if served with the petition.
Rule 64 — Miscellaneous

Hours of registrar
(3)
The hours of attendance by the registrar and the registry staff
are from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.
Lunch hours
(4)
Where a registry has insufficient staff to allow continuous staff
attendance at the lunch hour, the Chief Justice may, in writing,
authorize that registry to close.
Use of seal
(5)
In each registry the seal, directed by the rules, shall be used
and shall be stamped on every writ and other document requiring a
seal, issued out of or filed in that registry.
Name of registry
(6)
The name of the registry shall be written or stamped on the face
of every document issued from or filed or recorded in a registry.
Signature of registrar
(7)
Where the signature of the registrar is required on a certificate
relating to a matter of record in the court or registry, a notice,
or any process by consent, in default, or ex parte, the document
shall be deemed to have been signed by the registrar if his or her
name is written, printed, stamped or otherwise made apparent on it
by a person appointed by the registrar to perform that function.
Business not to be done out of office hours
(8)
No writ or process shall be issued from and no proceedings shall
be taken in the registry out of office hours, but in case of
urgency, the court may order that a registry be opened for the
purpose of commencing a proceeding or for some other good reason.
Disposition of præcipes, etc.
(9)
A registry may destroy any præcipe or notice of hearing submitted
under Rule 10 (11) or (12).
Incapacity of judge before judgment given
(10)
Where an application ought to be made to, or any jurisdiction
exercised by, the judge by whom a proceeding has been tried or
partly tried, or heard or partly heard, then if that judge dies or
ceases to be a judge of the court during or after the trial or
hearing, or if for any other reason it is impossible or
inconvenient for that judge to act in the proceeding, the Chief
Justice or next senior judge of the court may either by a special
or by a general order nominate some other judge to whom the
application may be made or by whom the jurisdiction may be
exercised.
Idem
(11)
Without restricting the generality of the foregoing, that other
judge may order that the proceeding be restored to the proper
registry for retrial or rehearing, and, in case the original trial
or hearing was upon evidence given viva voce, may direct that the
retrial or rehearing shall be upon an official transcript of that
evidence, or upon such transcript and evidence given viva voce and
evidence given by affidavit, or upon new evidence, or otherwise,
as in his or her opinion the circumstances of the case require,
and may dispose of the costs of the original trial or hearing and
of the costs of furnishing any copies of the transcript of the
evidence, or may refer the question of costs to the judge
presiding at the retrial or rehearing.
Idem
(12)
No directions for a retrial or rehearing which include a direction
for the use of the transcript of the evidence shall limit or
restrict the power of the judge presiding at the retrial or
rehearing to permit in his or her discretion the recalling of any
witness called at the original trial or hearing, or to receive
other or additional evidence.
Transfers
(13)
At any time after a proceeding is commenced, the court may on
application order it to be transferred from the registry in which
it was commenced to any other registry of the court for any or all
purposes.

This guarantee is made between the RECEIVER, THE SURETY, AND HER
MAJESTY THE QUEEN in right of British Columbia.
1. The receiver and the surety hereby jointly and severally covenant
with Her Majesty the Queen in right of British Columbia that the
receiver will, from time to time, duly account for what the receiver
has already received since the date of the order appointing the
receiver and shall hereafter receive or for what since the date of
the order the receiver has or shall hereafter become liable to pay
or account for as receiver [
and manager
] and will pay every sum of money and deliver every property that
the court may direct.
2. If the receiver shall not, for every successive 12 months
computed from the date of the receiver's appointment, pay at the
office of the surety the annual premium noted above, then the surety
shall be at liberty to apply to be relieved from all further
liability under this guarantee, except in respect of any damage or
loss occasioned by any act or default of the receiver in relation to
the receiver's duties as receiver [
and manager
] prior to the hearing and determination of the application.
3. A statement under the hand of the registrar of the amount which
the receiver is liable to pay and has not paid under paragraph 1 and
that the loss or damage has been incurred through the act or default
of the receiver shall be conclusive evidence in any action by Her
Majesty against the receiver and surety, or either of them, or by
the surety against the receiver, of the truth of the contents of the
statement and shall constitute a binding charge not only against the
receiver and the receiver's personal representatives, but also
against the surety and its funds and property without it being
necessary for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the surety
and the surety's funds and property and without it being necessary
for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the receiver for the
recovery thereof and without any further or other proof being given
in that behalf in any action to enforce this guarantee.
4. The liability of the surety under this guarantee is limited to
the sum noted above, provided that the registrar may give his or her
approval in writing to the reduction of the liability of the surety,
in which event the surety's maximum liability with respect to any
acts or omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of the
approval is reduced accordingly and provided further that an
endorsement executed by the surety increasing the liability of the
surety shall be binding on the surety with respect to any acts or
omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of that
endorsement.
5. The receiver will, on being discharged from office or on ceasing
to act as receiver [
and manager
], forthwith give written notice thereof to the surety, and also
within 7 days of the notice give the surety a copy of any order
discharging the receiver.
6. The receiver and the receiver's personal representatives will at
all times hereafter indemnify the surety against all loss, damage,
costs, and expenses which the surety sustains by reason of the
surety having executed this guarantee.
In witness whereof, the receiver has hereunder set his or her hand
and seal and the surety has caused its common seal to be affixed the

Registrar
Appendix B
Ordinary Costs
Interpretation
1.
In this Appendix "process" means the drawing, filing, service or
delivery of a document and any amendment to it or particulars of it,
but does not include an application made with respect to the process
or any part of the process.
Scale of costs
2.
(1) Where a court has made an order for costs, it may fix the scale,
from Scale 1 to 5 in subsection (2), under which the costs will be
assessed, and may order that one or more steps in the proceeding be
assessed under a different scale from that fixed for other steps.
(2) In fixing the scale of costs the court shall have regard to the
following principles:
(a) Scale 1 is for matters of little difficulty;
(b) Scale 2 is for matters of less than ordinary difficulty;
(c) Scale 3 is for matters of ordinary difficulty or importance;
(d) Scale 4 is for matters of more than ordinary difficulty or
importance;
(e) Scale 5 is for matters of unusual difficulty or importance.
(3) In fixing the appropriate scale under which costs will be
assessed, the court may take into account the following:
(a) whether a difficult issue of law, fact or construction is
involved;
(b) whether an issue is of importance to a class or body of persons,
or is of general interest;
(c) whether the result of the proceeding effectively determines the
rights and obligations as between the parties beyond the relief that
was actually granted or denied.
(4) Where an order for costs has been made, or where, on a
settlement, payment of assessed costs has been agreed to, but no
scale has been fixed or agreed to, then the costs shall be assessed
under Scale 3, unless a party, on application, obtains an order of
the court that the costs be assessed under another scale.
Assessment of costs
3.
(1) The value for each unit allowed on an assessment is as follows:
(a) Scale 1 — $20 for each unit;
(b) Scale 2 — $40 for each unit;
(c) Scale 3 — $60 for each unit;
(d) Scale 4 — $80 for each unit;
(e) Scale 5 — $100 for each unit.
(2) Where maximum and minimum numbers of units are provided for in
an Item in the Tariff, the registrar has the discretion to allow a
number within that range of units.
(3) In assessing costs where the Tariff indicates a range of units,
the registrar shall have regard to the following principles:
(a) one unit is for matters upon which little time should ordinarily
have been spent;
(b) he maximum number of units is for matters upon which a great
deal of time should ordinarily have been spent.
Per diem rates
4.
(1) Where in a Tariff Item a number of units is allowed for each day
but the time spent during a day is not more than 2 1/2 hours, only
1/2 of the number of units shall be allowed for that day.
(2) Where in a Tariff Item a number of units is allowed for each day
but the time spent during a day is more than 5 hours, the number of
units allowed for that day shall be increased by 1/2 of the number.
(3) Where in a Tariff Item a number of units is allowed for
preparation for an attendance but the time spent on the attendance
is not more than 2 1/2 hours, only 1/2 of the number of units for
preparation shall be allowed.
Uncontested matrimonial proceedings
5.
In a divorce proceeding that has proceeded to judgment under Rule
60B (46) (a), or in a proceeding for judicial separation or
annulment of marriage that is uncontested at trial on any issue
except costs, the costs shall be assessed under Scale 2.
Uncontested foreclosure proceedings
6.
In a proceeding under Rule 50, uncontested at the hearing on any
issue except costs, the costs shall be assessed under Scale 2.
Increased costs
7.
(1) Where the court determines that for any reason there would be an
unjust result if costs were assessed under Scales 1 to 5, the court
may, at any time before the assessment has been completed, order
that costs be assessed as increased costs under subsection (2).
(2) Where costs are ordered to be assessed as increased costs, the
assessing officer shall fix the fees that would have been allowed if
an order for special costs had been made under Rule 57 (2), and
shall then allow 1/2 of those fees, or a higher or lower proportion
as the court may order, together with all proper expenses and
disbursements.
Default judgment and process for execution
8.
(1) Where judgment is entered upon default of appearance or of
pleading, the costs shall be in accordance with Schedule 1.
(2) Where a writ of execution or garnishing order, or process in
Forms 51 to 53, is issued, the costs shall be endorsed on the
process and allowed in accordance with Schedule 2, instead of Item
32.
(3) The amount involved under subsection (1) is the amount for which
the judgment is entered.
(4) The amount involved under subsection (2) is the amount payable,
if any, that is endorsed on the process.
(5) In addition to the fees set out in Schedules 1 and 2, the costs
of any application to the court relating to the process for
execution may be ordered to be assessed under the Tariff.
