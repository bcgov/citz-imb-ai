Report of Exempt Distribution
A. General Instructions
1. Filing instructions
An issuer or underwriter that is required to file a report of exempt
distribution and pay the applicable fee must file the report and pay
the fee as follows:
•
In British Columbia
— through BCSC eServices at http://www.bcsc.bc.ca.
•
In Ontario
— through the online e-form available at http://www.osc.gov.on.ca.
•
In all other jurisdictions
— through the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval
(SEDAR) in accordance with National Instrument 13-101
System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR)
if required, or otherwise with the securities regulatory authority
or regulator, as applicable, in the applicable jurisdictions at the
addresses listed at the end of this form.
The issuer or underwriter must file the report in a jurisdiction of
Canada if the distribution occurs in the jurisdiction. If a
distribution is made in more than one jurisdiction of Canada, the
issuer or underwriter may satisfy its obligation to file the report
by completing a single report identifying all purchasers, and file
the report in each jurisdiction of Canada in which the distribution
occurs. Filing fees payable in a particular jurisdiction are not
affected by identifying all purchasers in a single report.
In order to determine the applicable fee in a particular
jurisdiction of Canada, consult the securities legislation of that
jurisdiction.
2. Issuers located outside of Canada
If an issuer located outside of Canada determines that a
distribution has taken place in a jurisdiction of Canada, include
information about purchasers resident in that jurisdiction only.
3. Multiple distributions
An issuer may use one report for multiple distributions occurring
within 10 days of each other, provided the report is filed on or
before the 10th day following the first distribution date. However,
an investment fund issuer that is relying on the exemptions set out
in subsection 6.2 (2) of NI 45-106 may file the report annually in
accordance with that subsection.
4. References to purchaser
References to a purchaser in this form are to the beneficial owner
of the securities.
However, if a trust company, trust corporation, or registered
adviser described in paragraph (p) or (q) of the definition of
"accredited investor" in section 1.1 of NI 45-106 has purchased the
securities on behalf of a fully managed account, provide information
about the trust company, trust corporation or registered adviser
only; do not include information about the beneficial owner of the
fully managed account.
5. References to issuer
References to "issuer" in this form include an investment fund
issuer and a non-investment fund issuer, unless otherwise specified.
6. Investment fund issuers
If the issuer is an investment fund, complete Items 1-3, 6-8, 10, 11
and Schedule 1 of this form.

applicable items of this form other than Item 6.
8. Language
The report must be filed in English or in French. In Québec, the
issuer or underwriter must comply with linguistic rights and
obligations prescribed by Québec law.
9. Currency
All dollar amounts in the report must be in Canadian dollars. If the
distribution was made or any compensation was paid in connection
with the distribution in a foreign currency, convert the currency to
Canadian dollars using the daily noon exchange rate of the Bank of
Canada on the distribution date. If the distribution date occurs on
a date when the daily noon exchange rate of the Bank of Canada is
not available, convert the currency to Canadian dollars using the
most recent closing exchange rate of the Bank of Canada available
before the distribution date. For investment funds in continuous
distribution, convert the currency to Canadian dollars using the
average daily noon exchange rate of the Bank of Canada for the
distribution period covered by the report.
If the Bank of Canada no longer publishes a daily noon exchange rate
and closing exchange rate, convert foreign currency using the daily
single indicative exchange rate of the Bank of Canada in the same
manner described in each of the three scenarios above.
If the distribution was not made in Canadian dollars, provide the
foreign currency in Item 7 (a) of the report.
10. Date of information in report
Unless otherwise indicated in this form, provide the information as
of the distribution end date.
11. Date of formation
For the date of formation, provide the date on which the issuer was
incorporated, continued or organized (formed). If the issuer
