Purpose of regulation 2 The purpose of this regulation is to protect streamside protection And enhancement areas from residential, commercial and industrial Development so that the areas can provide natural features, Functions and conditions that support fish life processes Including, but not limited to, the following natural features, Functions and conditions:
(a) large organic debris that falls into the stream or Streamside area, including logs, snags and root wads; (b) areas for channel migration, including active Floodplains;
(c) side channels, intermittent streams, seasonally wetted Contiguous areas and floodplains; (d) the multicanopied forest and ground cover adjacent to Streams that (i)  moderates water temperatures, (ii)  provides a source of food, nutrients and organic matter To streams, (iii)  establishes root matrices that stabilize soils and Streambanks thereby minimizing erosion, and (iv)  buffers streams from sedimentation and pollution in Surface runoff; (e) a natural source of stream bed substrates; (f) permeable surfaces that permit infiltration to moderate Water volume, timing and velocity and maintain sustained water Flows in streams, especially during low flow periods.
Intergovernmental cooperation agreements 3 (1)  this regulation is to be supported by intergovernmental Cooperation agreements that include provisions for any of the Following topics:
(a) financial and technical support for the implementation of This regulation; (b) a transition strategy to give effect to existing Agreements and approved streamside protection measures; (c) the staged establishment of streamside protection and Enhancement areas; (d) the confirmation of regionally significant fish by the Appropriate regional director of the ministry of water, land and Air protection; (e) the amendment of streamside protection and enhancement Areas determined under section 6; (f) providing, sharing or confirming information on fish Habitat conditions; (g) advice by qualified professionals with reference to the Operation of this regulation; (h) describing roles and responsibilities with reference to Applicable and appropriate use of authority and program mandates; (i) dispute resolution; (j) a compliance strategy, including education, training, Monitoring, reporting, enforcement and auditing.
(2)  for the purposes of subsection (1), an intergovernmental Cooperation agreement is an agreement made by the ministry of Water, land and air protection with the authorized representative Of the appropriate local government, which may include agreement With fisheries and oceans canada.
[am. b.c. reg. 109/2002, s. 1.] Application
4 (1)  this regulation applies to the use of local government Powers under part 26 of the Local government act By local governments.
(2)  this regulation does not apply in respect of a building Or structure described in section 911 (8) of the Local government act , if a local government issues a development permit or development Variance permit only for the purpose of enabling reconstruction or Repair of a permanent structure on its existing foundation.
Establishment of streamside protection and enhancement areas 5 A local government must establish streamside protection and Enhancement areas within 5 years of the enactment of this Regulation in accordance with section 6.
Determination of the width of riparian protection and enhancement Areas
6 (1)  streamside protection and enhancement areas are those Areas determined with reference to the following existing or Potential vegetation conditions by measuring perpendicularly away From the top of the bank or top of the ravine bank on either side Of a stream:
(a) intact and continuous areas of existing or potential Vegetation equal to or greater than 50 metres wide; (b) limited but continuous areas of existing or potential Vegetation equal to 30 metres wide or discontinuous but Occasionally wider areas of existing or potential vegetation Between 30 and 50 metres wide; (c) narrow but continuous areas of existing or potential Vegetation equal to 15 metres wide or discontinuous but Occasionally wider areas of existing or potential vegetation Between 15 and 30 metres wide; (d) very narrow but continuous areas of existing or potential Vegetation up to 5 metres wide or discontinuous but occasionally Wider areas of existing or potential vegetation between 5 and 15 Metres wide interspersed with permanent structures.
(2)  with reference to vegetation conditions in subsection (1), streamside protection and enhancement areas must be:
(a) if subsection (1) (a) or (b) applies, at least 30 metres Wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the bank for All fish bearing streams or for non fish bearing streams that are Permanent;
(b) if subsection (1) (a), (b) or (c) applies, at least 15 Metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of bank for Non fish bearing streams that are non-permanent; (c) if subsection (1) (c) applies, at least 15 metres wide Measured perpendicularly away from the top of bank for non fish Bearing streams that are permanent; (d) if subsection (1) (c) or (d) applies, the greater of the Widths determined under subsection (1) (c) or (d) or at least 15 Metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the bank For all fish bearing streams; (e) if subsection (1) (d) applies, at least 5 and up to 15 Metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the bank For all non fish bearing streams.
(3)  if a stream is in a ravine that is less than 60 metres Wide in total width from top of the ravine bank to top of ravine Bank, not including the stream channel within its active Floodplain boundaries, protection is to be consistent with Subsection (2) (a) through (e), where appropriate, from the top of The ravine bank.
(4)  if a stream is in a ravine that is more than 60 metres In total width from top of ravine bank to top of ravine bank, not Including the stream channel within its active floodplain Boundaries, a protection and enhancement area must be at least 10 Metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the Ravine bank.
(5)  in determining a streamside protection and enhancement Area a local government may make allowances for one or more of the Following if supported by an agreement under section 3:
(a) the potential to provide greater opportunity for Streamside protection and enhancement than what would be achieved Under subsections (2) to (4); (b) the existence of obstacles that impair the ability to Designate streamside protection and enhancement areas in Accordance with subsections (2) to (4) including, but not limited To the following:
(i)  biophysical conditions; (ii)  existing parcel sizes; (iii)  existing roads, works or services; (iv)  proposed roads, works and services needed to provide Access or services to otherwise developable land; (v)  the existence of artificial controls on the high water Mark or water level of a stream.
Use of local government powers for protection and enhancement of Areas
7 When exercising its powers with respect to residential, commercial And industrial development, a local government must protect Streamside protection and enhancement areas.
