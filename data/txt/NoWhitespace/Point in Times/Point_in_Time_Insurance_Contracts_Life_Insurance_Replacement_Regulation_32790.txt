Schedule
(Sections 1, 3 and 4)
Basic Disclosure Statement Regarding Replacement
This statement is designed to provide you with information that you
might find helpful in deciding whether to change your life
insurance. Such a change may involve the use of proceeds available
to you under your life insurance to buy replacement life insurance.
As it will be necessary to decide what change is the most
advantageous for yourself or your beneficiaries, you are encouraged
to seek comments or quotations from your life insurance agent and
the life insurance company which issued your existing life insurance
contract.
In the event that you decide to replace any existing contract(s) of
life insurance you should make certain that the new contract(s) that
has (have) been delivered to you, is (are) in force and is (are)
acceptable to you before you take any action to terminate the
existing contract(s).
AGENT'S STATEMENT:
The primary reason for recommending replacement of the life
insurance
referred to on this Disclosure Statement is:
......................................................................................................................................................................
......................................................................................................................................................................
The life insurance to be replaced cannot adequately fulfill the
policy owner's intended objective for the following reason(s):

APPLICANT'S STATEMENT:
I acknowledge being advised that there may be advantages or
disadvantages in replacing life insurance policies, some of
which are:
(a) by replacing my contract of life insurance I may be paying the
acquisition costs twice because these are charged in the early years
of my contract(s);
(b) because my contract of life insurance was purchased at a younger
age, I may pay more for a new contract having the same or similar
benefits;
(c) as the incontestable and suicide clauses begin to run again in a
new contract, a claim may be denied under a new contract which would
have been paid under the contract replaced;
(d) as a change in my health may have adversely affected my
insurability, a new contract may contain certain restrictions or
limitations and may be more costly;
(e) policy conditions or benefits, including the interest rate on
policy loans, may be more favourable under the existing contract of
life insurance to be replaced;
(f) if the transaction to purchase a new contract(s) of life
insurance involves borrowing the cash value of my existing
contract(s) of life insurance beyond my expected ability or
intention to repay the loan, a loss or reduction of the benefits
under my existing contract(s) of life insurance will result;
(g) by replacing or changing my contract of life insurance acquired
prior to December 2, 1982, or in the case of corporate owned life
insurance prior to June 29, 1982, I may lose valuable tax advantages
within the existing policy.
A copy of this disclosure form will be sent to the life insurers
which issued the contract(s) of life insurance to be replaced.
I also acknowledge receipt of a fully completed Disclosure Statement
Regarding Replacement of Contracts of Life Insurance and acknowledge
that it was presented to me before the application for new insurance
was signed.
I have been advised by the agent who signed this form that I may
withdraw, in writing, my application for new insurance within 20
days and that the insurer will refund any premium deposit or other
payment made by me in respect of the proposed replacement of a
contract of life insurance, except if the application is for a
single premium life insurance policy, or a policy the value of which
depends upon a stated rate of interest and/or a stated group of
assets, in which case the refund shall be adjusted to reflect the
change in the capital value of the contract.
