(2)  for notices of rent increase effective on or after January 1, 1999, the basic rent increase is calculated according To section 11.
Calculation of basic rent increase on or after january 1, 1999 11 (1)  for this section:
"base rent" Means the rent lawfully in effect on the date on which the Disputed notice of rent increase was given; "relevant year" Means the most recent fiscal year for the park ending at least six Months prior to january 1 of the calendar year in which the notice Of rent increase is effective; "preceding year" Means the fiscal year for the park immediately preceding the Relevant year.
(2)  if a change in the relevant year used for the park Results in capital expenditures or a change in local government Levies being counted twice or omitted, the subcommittee or an Arbitrator may:
(a) exclude any capital expenditures occurring in the Relevant year or changes in local government levies occurring Between the relevant and preceding year which were included in the Calculation of the basic rent increase for the same pad or pads For a previous year in a mediation or arbitration; or (b) include any capital expenditures or changes in local Government levies which occurred during an intervening period and Which were not included in the calculation of the basic rent Increase for the same pad or pads for a previous year in a Mediation or arbitration.
(3)  the basic rent increase for notices of rent increase Effective on or after january 1, 1999 is calculated using the Following steps:
Step 1: calculate estimated gross annual income Estimated gross annual income from the park is calculated using The following formula and definition:
Estimated gross annual income = monthly rent x 12 In the formula:
"monthly rent" Is the sum of (a) the full rent payable for the last month of the relevant Year for each manufactured home pad in the park that is occupied By a home owner who does not receive a discount on the rent, and (b) the full rent payable for the last month of the relevant Year for a similar manufactured home pad, with comparable Services, facilities and surroundings in the manufactured home Park, for each manufactured home pad in the park that is (i)  vacant, (ii)  used in the operation of the manufactured home park, or (iii)  occupied by a person who receives a discount on the Rent, such as the park owner, a relative of the park owner, or an Employee or agent of the park owner.
Step 2: calculate percentage rent adjustment from local Government levies The percentage rent adjustment from local government levies (lgl) Is calculated using the following formula and definitions:
Lgl for relevant year — lgl for preceding year % Adjustment from lgl = X
100 Estimated gross annual income In the formula:
"local government levies" Or
"lgl" Means any property, school or other tax, levy or fee applicable to The park and payable to the local government (including Municipalities and regional districts), including transit, Recycling (blue box), garbage, sewer and water fees.
Step 3: calculate percentage rent adjustment from capital Expenditures
The percentage rent adjustment from capital expenditures is the Amount obtained using the following formula and definitions:
Sum of capital Expenditures
X
Capital expenditure Adjustment rate % adjustment from Capital expenditures = X
100 Estimated gross annual income In the formula:
"capital expenditure" Means a major expenditure made by the park owner in respect of the Park during the relevant year that is non-recurring within a Reasonable number of years and is (a) necessary to (i)  protect or restore the physical integrity of the park, (ii)  comply with municipal or provincial health, safety or Housing standards, (iii)  maintain water, sewage, electrical, lighting, roadway Or other facilities, (iv)  provide access for persons with disabilities, or (v)  promote the efficient use of energy or water, or (b) for renovations or new services or facilities with the Written approval of (i)  the home owner, if the expenditure benefits only the Manufactured home pad of that home owner, or (ii)  at least 2/3 of the home owners in the manufactured Home park who will benefit from the expenditure, And is not an expenditure required because the residential Property has not been properly maintained in the past or an Expenditure for which the park owner has been or will be Compensated by another person; "capital expenditure adjustment rate" Means the relevant percentage in appendix a for the year Corresponding to the effective date of the disputed notice of rent Increase.
If a capital expenditure clearly benefits only one pad or some of The pads in the park, and is unrelated to the shared facilities or Infrastructure of the park, a separate calculation must be done to Separate that expenditure from those benefiting all pads. in those Cases, the estimated gross annual income must be replaced with the Estimated gross annual income from the benefiting pad or pads in The formula in this step, and the resulting rent adjustment must Be applied to the rent of the benefiting pad or pads only.
Step 4: determine percentage rent adjustment from rent Inflation factor The percentage rent increase from the rent inflation factor is the Percentage provided in appendix a that corresponds to the Effective date of the notice of rent increase.
Step 5: calculate basic rent increase The basic rent increase expressed as a percentage is the sum of The percentage rent adjustment from local government levies, the Percentage rent adjustment from capital expenditures, and the Percentage rent adjustment from the rent inflation factor.
The basic rent increase expressed in dollars is calculated by Multiplying the percentage basic rent increase by the base rent.
