Extent and Application of Rules and Regulations
Application of rules and regulations
1
These rules and regulations shall apply to all railways operating
under the jurisdiction of the Government of British Columbia.
Railway company responsibility
2
Every railway company will be held responsible for the general
condition of all locomotives under its control. The mechanical
officer in charge at each point where boilerwork is done will be
held responsible for the inspection and repair of all locomotive
boilers and appurtenances under his jurisdiction. He must know
that all defects disclosed by any inspection are properly repaired
before the locomotive is returned to service. Such railway company
shall appoint a practical boilermaker, as inspector, to carry out
repairs, inspections and tests of locomotives, and all reports of
such filed with the ministry shall bear his signature in
conjunction with that of the mechanical officer in charge of the
shop where such repairs, tests and examinations are made. The safe
working pressure for each locomotive boiler shall be fixed by the
chief inspector of the ministry after full consideration has been
given to the design, workmanship, age and condition.
Portions of Boiler Code applicable
3
That portion of the regulations known as Part III and Part V of
the "British Columbia Railway Department Boiler Code", adopted by
Order in Council No. 126 under the
Railway Act
on the 21st day of January, 1947, shall govern the design,
registration and construction of all pressure parts used on
locomotives. In particular, Part III, relating to the design,
registration and construction of unfired pressure vessels, shall
govern the design, registration and construction of unfired
pressure vessels used on locomotives; and Part V, relating to the
design, registration and construction of railway locomotive
boilers, shall govern the design, registration and construction of
locomotive boilers and their appurtenances.
[ed. note: Boiler Code = that adopted by B.C. Reg. 45/91]
General Inspection Rules
Inspection before locomotive in service
4
Every locomotive shall be inspected before being put into service
and at least every 12 months thereafter by an inspector of the
ministry. Inspectors shall have the right, at all reasonable
hours, to examine locomotives, and may refuse to grant a
certificate for any locomotive found defective according to the
provisions of these rules. They may order out of service any
locomotive which for any cause they consider unfit and dangerous
to operate.
Reporting of defects
5
It is the duty of every locomotive engineer to inform the
inspector of any defects known or believed to exist in the
locomotive under his charge. The certificate of competency of any
locomotive engineer refusing or refraining from doing so may be
revoked by the inspector.
If boilers too hot for safety inspection
6
Inspectors may decline to examine boilers considered too hot for
safety and convenience, and shall refuse to grant certificates for
same until a satisfactory examination can be made.
Methods of boiler inspection
7
In order to satisfy himself as to the thickness of a plate or the
internal condition of a boiler, the inspector may, should he deem
it necessary, order holes to be cut therein and may demand such
information by drawings and specifications of the several parts as
will enable him to determine their strength. In the event of such
information being unobtainable, he shall use a safety factor of
5.5 with such additions thereto as his judgment may dictate.
First and subsequent inspection requirements
8
At the first inspection of a locomotive the jacket and covering
shall be removed by the owner or his agent, so that a thorough
examination of the plates and rivets can be made. At subsequent
inspections such jacket and covering or any part of same shall be
removed upon the request of the inspector.
Lap-joint longitudinal seam examination
9
Every boiler having lap-joint longitudinal seams without
reinforcing plates shall be examined with special care in order to
detect any grooving or cracks at the edges of the seams.
Safety valves, fittings, etc.
10
Inspectors shall see that the safety valves, water gauges, test
cocks, blow-off pipes, main steam pipes and all fittings and
connections of boilers are in good order and sufficient in number
and that they comply with the requirements of these rules and
regulations.
Calculation of strength of boiler
11
Inspectors shall calculate the strength of locomotive boilers by
formul√¶ provided in Part V of the "British Columbia Railway
Department Boiler Code", and determine the safe working pressure
thereof according to the calculated strength of the various parts
and the workmanship and materials of which they are composed, and
shall record such working pressure upon the certificate of
inspection. In cases where the necessary formula for any type of
boiler is not provided, application shall be made to the chief
inspector who shall furnish same.
[ed. note: Boiler Code = that adopted by B.C. Reg. 45/91]
Excess of pressure
12
In cases where inspectors find that a locomotive boiler is or has
been carrying an excess of pressure beyond that which has been
recorded on the certificate of inspection, they shall report same
to the chief inspector for prosecution and require the owner to
install thereon a lockup valve of approved pattern to prevent the
carrying of any excessive pressure.
Certificates
Issuance and display of certificate
13
A certificate shall be issued by the inspector for every
locomotive found, after inspection and testing, to be in
satisfactory working condition. Such certificate, showing date of
last inspection and working pressure allowed, shall be placed
under glass in the cab of every such locomotive.
Period of certificate
14
Certificates shall be issued covering a period of 12 months, but
should the inspector consider it advisable, he may issue a
certificate for a lesser period.
Suspension of certificate
15
Inspectors finding defects in any locomotive having an unexpired
certificate may suspend such certificate until repairs are made or
necessary fittings supplied.

Interior Inspection of Boilers
Interior inspection
20
Inspectors shall examine the interior of every boiler thoroughly
before it is put into service and whenever a sufficient number of
flues are removed to allow examination.
Methods of inspection
21
In order to ascertain the thickness of plates or to detect the
presence of cracks or the effects of corrosion in inaccessible
internal areas, the chief inspector may approve the use of X-ray,
radiographs or other non-destructive tests; he may, should he deem
it necessary, order the removal of the flues or other parts when
an indication of leaks or defects are such that the removal of the
flues or other parts would provide the sole means of access to the
area affected.
[en. B.C. Reg. 166/65, s. (a).]
Inspection when flues removed
22
The company shall notify the chief inspector when the flues of the
boiler of any locomotive in service have been taken out so that an
inspector from the ministry may make an inspection of the internal
parts thereof, and the chief inspector shall submit a report to
the company setting forth the findings of the internal inspection,
and a copy of such report shall be kept on record in the office of
the chief inspector. When the flues are taken out, all scale must
be removed and the inside of the boiler thoroughly cleaned.
[en. B.C. Reg. 166/65, s. (a).]
Details of inspection
23
Inspectors must examine the entire interior of the boiler for
cracks, pitting, grooving or indication of overheating, and for
damage where mud has collected or heavy scale formed. The edges of
plates, all laps, seams and points where cracks and defects are
likely to develop or which an exterior examination may have
indicated must be given an especially minute examination. It must
be seen that braces and stays are taut, that pins are properly
secured in place and that each is in a condition to support its
proportion of the load.
[en. B.C. Reg. 166/65, s. (a).]
Exterior Inspection of Boilers
Exterior inspection
24
Inspectors shall examine the exterior of every boiler thoroughly
before it is put into service and whenever the jacket and lagging
are removed.
Inspection under hydrostatic pressure
25
The inspector shall examine the exterior of the boiler while it is
under hydrostatic pressure. If the inspector considers it
necessary, he may order the removal of the jacket and lagging at
any time when leaks are indicated.
[en. B.C. Reg. 166/65, s. (a).]
Hydrostatic Testing of Boilers
Requirement for hydrostatic testing
26
Inspectors may, whenever it is deemed necessary, and they shall,
before a locomotive is put into service, and at least once a year
thereafter, subject the boiler of same to a hydrostatic test 25%
in excess of the working pressure allowed, using water at a
temperature of 100¬∞ Fahrenheit; provided, however, that such test
may be omitted for reasons to be stated in the inspector's report.
Owner's responsibility during testing
27
For the purpose of such tests the owner or his agent shall provide
the necessary piping and fittings to connect the inspector's pump
to the boiler and shall provide men to fill the boiler with water,
make all joints, work the test pump and assist the inspector
during the test.
Dome-cap and throttle stand-pipe removal
28
The dome-cap and throttle stand-pipe must be removed and the
interior surface and connections of the boiler examined thoroughly
as conditions will permit. In case the boiler can be entered and
inspected without removing the throttle stand-pipe, the inspector
may order the dome-cap only to be removed, but he must note this
variation from the rule in his inspection report.
Inspection by railway company inspector
29
When a railway company's inspector makes the test an authorized
representative of the company thoroughly familiar with boiler
construction must personally witness the test and examine the
boiler while it is under hydrostatic pressure.
Inspection after repairs
30
When all necessary repairs have been completed the boiler shall be
fired up and the steam pressure raised to not less than the
allowed working pressure and the boiler and appurtenances
carefully examined. All cocks, valves, seams, rivets and bolts
must be tight under the pressure and all defects disclosed must be
repaired.
Defects and reinspection
31
In any case where defects are discovered or in which the test is
unsatisfactory to the inspector, the defects shall be made good
and the boiler reinspected before a certificate is issued.
Stay-bolt Testing
Time of testing rigid bolts
32
All stay-bolts shall be tested at least once each month.
Stay-bolts shall also be tested immediately after each hydrostatic
test.
Method of testing rigid bolts
33
The inspector must tap each bolt and determine the broken bolts
from the sound or the vibration of the sheet. If stay-bolt tests
are made when the boiler is filled with water, there must be not
less than 50 pound pressure on the boiler. Should the boiler not
be under pressure, the test may be made after draining all the
water from the boiler, in which case the vibration of the sheet
will indicate any unsoundness.
Method of testing flexible stay-bolts with caps
34
(1)¬† All stay-bolts equipped with caps over the outer ends
shall have the caps removed upon completion of 60 calendar months
actual service, provided such service is performed within 6
consecutive years, at which time all bolts and sleeves must be
examined and effectively tested for breakage fracture. Portions of
calendar months "out of service" will not be counted. Time "out of
service" must be properly accounted for by "out of service"
reports and notations of months claimed "out of service" made on
the back of each subsequent inspection report and cab-card. Each
time a hydrostatic test is applied, the hammer test required by
sections 32 and 33 must be made while the boiler is under
hydrostatic pressure not less than the allowed working-pressure.
(2)¬† The removal of flexible stay-bolt caps and other tests
shall be reported on Form No. 2 and a proper record kept in the
office of the railway company of the inspections and tests made.
(3)¬† Fire box sheets must be carefully examined at least once
every month for mud burn, bulging and indication of broken
stay-bolts.
(4)¬† Stay-bolt caps shall be removed, or any of the above
tests made, whenever the ministry's inspector or the railway
company's inspector considers the removal desirable in order to
determine thoroughly the condition of stay-bolts or stay-bolt
sleeves.
Method of testing flexible stay-bolts without caps
35
Flexible stay-bolts which do not have caps shall be tested once
each month, the same as rigid bolts. Each time a hydrostatic test
is applied, such stay-bolt test shall be made while the boiler is
under hydrostatic pressure not less than the allowed working
pressure and proper notation of such test made on Form No. 2.
Broken stay-bolts
36
No boiler shall be allowed to remain in service when there are 2
adjacent stay-bolts broken or plugged in any part of the fire box
or combustion chamber, nor when 3 or more are broken or plugged in
a circle 4 feet in diameter, nor when 5 or more are broken or
plugged in the entire boiler.
Telltale holes
37
All stay-bolts shorter than 8 inches, except flexible bolts, shall
have telltale holes at least 3/16 inch in diameter and not less
than 1 1/4 inches deep in the outer end. These holes must be kept
open at all times.
Steam Gauges

correctly indicate the working pressure. Care must be taken to
locate the gauge so that it will be kept reasonably cool and can
be conveniently read by the enginemen.
Siphon
39
Every gauge shall have a siphon of ample capacity to prevent steam
entering the gauge. The pipe connection shall enter the boiler
direct and shall be maintained steam-tight between the boiler and
gauge. The siphon pipe and its connections to the boiler must be
cleaned each time the gauge is tested.
Time of testing
40
Steam gauges shall be tested at least once every 3 months and also
when any irregularity is reported.
Method of testing
41
Steam gauges shall be compared with an accurate test gauge or dead
weight tester and gauges found inaccurate shall be corrected
before being put into service.
Badge plates
42
A metal badge plate showing the allowed steam pressure shall be
attached to the boiler head in the cab. If the boiler head is
lagged, the lagging and jacket shall be cut away so the plate can
be seen.
Boiler number
43
The builder's number of the boiler, if known, shall be stamped on
the dome. If the builder's number of the boiler cannot be
obtained, an assigned number, which shall be used in making out a
specification card, shall be stamped on the face plate.
Safety Valves
Safety valves
44
Every boiler shall be equipped with at least 2 safety valves, the
capacity of which shall be sufficient to prevent, under any
conditions of service, an accumulation of pressure more than 5%
above the allowed steam pressure.
Setting of safety valves
45
Safety valves shall be set by the gauge used on the boiler to pop
at pressures not exceeding 3% above the allowed steam pressure;
the gauge in all cases to be tested before the safety valves are
set or any changes made in the setting. When safety valves are
being set, the water level in the boiler must not be above the
highest gauge cock.
Frequency of testing
46
Safety valves shall be tested under steam at least once every 3
months and also when any irregularity is reported.
Water Glass and Gauge Cocks

51
Water gauge glass mountings on all locomotives must be protected
by a strong cage made of aluminium or brass metal fitted with
heavy specially toughened glass shields 3/8 inch think, with an
outlet pipe attached to the bottom of the water gauge mounting
which will allow the flow of steam from broken gauge glass to
escape below the foot plate of the locomotive or close to the foot
plate itself. These appurtenances must be so located as to ensure
a correct reading of the level of the water in the boiler at all
times, and be in full view of both the engineer and fireman, and
the lights so placed that there will be a clear and unobstructed
view of the water in the mounting.
