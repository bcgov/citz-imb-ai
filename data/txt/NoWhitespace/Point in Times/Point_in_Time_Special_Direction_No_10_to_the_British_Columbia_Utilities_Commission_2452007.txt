Subject to section 5 (2) (a), in regulating, and fixing rates for,
the authority, including, without limitation,
(a) considering an application made by the authority for a
certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 45
of the Act,
(b) doing anything referred to in section 45 (6.2) (a), (b)
or (c) of the Act with respect to a plan filed by the authority
under section 45 (6.1) of the Act, and
(c) considering an energy supply contract under section 71 of
the Act,
the commission must use the criterion that the authority is to
achieve energy and capacity self-sufficiency by becoming capable
of
(d) meeting, by 2016 and each year thereafter, the
electricity supply obligations, and
(e) exceeding, as soon as practicable but no later than 2026,
the electricity supply obligations by at least 3 000 gigawatt
hours per year and by the capacity required to integrate that
energy in the most cost-effective manner
solely from electricity generating facilities within the Province,
assuming no more in each year than the firm energy capability from
the assets that are hydroelectric facilities.
Section 6 was added by BC Reg 17/2012, effective February 3, 2012.
