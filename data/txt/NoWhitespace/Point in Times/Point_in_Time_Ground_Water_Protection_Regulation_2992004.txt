a person under the direct supervision of
(i)
a qualified well driller, or
(ii)
a qualified professional who has competency in the field of
hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering.
(3)
Subsection (2) does not apply to
(a)
a well 15 feet (4.57 m) or less in depth,
(b)
an excavated well 50 feet (15 m) or less in depth, or
(c)
a test pit.
(4)
When closing a well, the well must be filled throughout its depth
with a combination of appropriate sealants and backfill materials
and with a closure plug in the upper portion of the well, as shown
in Figure 6 of Schedule 1.
(5)
If a closure plug is required for a well under Column 5 of Table
3, the closure plug must
(a)
consist of an appropriate sealant, and
(b)
be a length that is not less than the minimum length specified in
Column 6 of Table 3.
(6)
A sealant must be placed in a well in a manner that ensures the
physical integrity and continuity of the seal at the appropriate
depths.
(7)
When closing a well,
(a)
the well must be completely filled in a manner so as to preclude
any lengthwise movement of liquids within the well or in any
visible annular space surrounding the outer well casing or between
well casings,
(b)
if practicable, all equipment and instrumentation in the well must
be removed before closing,
(c)
the well casings may be left in place,
(d)
the maximum interval between sealant layers must not exceed 20
feet within the uncased hole,

=
A surface seal is not required but is recommended in cases
where there is a significant potential for contaminants to
enter the well either at the time of drilling or at a later
date.
3 V
=
The length of the surface seal must be at least 3 feet, unless
a qualified professional who has competency in the field of
hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering or an engineer under
the Water Act confirms in writing that a lesser length will
not significantly increase the risk of a contaminant entering
the well or aquifer.
Note:
If it is not desirable to have the sealant exposed at the
ground surface, the sealant may extend to within 1 foot of the
ground surface to allow for 1 foot of backfill materials but
must still have a total length at least equal to that
specified in the Table.

Explanation
Optional
=
A closure plug is not required, but is recommended in cases
where there is a significant potential for contaminants to
enter the well either at the time of construction or at a
later date.
3 V
=
The length of the closure plug must be at least 3 feet, unless
a qualified professional who has competency in the field of
hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering or an engineer under
the
Water Act
confirms in writing that a lesser length will not
significantly increase the risk of a contaminant entering the
well or aquifer. In wells to be closed, the closure plug
should extend a minimum 3 feet below the base of any
excavation dug to remove the pitless adapter.
15 V
=
The length of the closure plug must be at least 15 feet,
unless a qualified professional who has competency in the
field of hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering or an
engineer under the
Water Act
confirms in writing that a lesser length will not
significantly increase the risk of a contaminant entering the
well or aquifer.
Retain
=
Keep a copy of the well closure report at least 5 years and
make it available on request.
Submit
=
Submit the final well closure report to the Comptroller of
Water Rights.
Note:
If it is not desirable to have the closure plug exposed at the
ground surface, the closure plug may extend to within 1 foot
of the ground surface to allow for 1 foot of backfill
materials but must still have a total length at least equal to
that specified in the Table.
