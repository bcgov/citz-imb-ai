(9) After the closure of (a) A water supply well, (b) A vertical recharge well made by drilling, (c) An vertical injection well made by drilling, or (d) A permanent vertical dewatering well made by drilling, The person responsible for that work must promptly complete a well Closure report that contains the information required by schedule 3, and must submit that report to the comptroller, along with a Copy to the well owners, within 90 days after the well is closed.
(10) After the closure of (a) A geotechnical well, other than a test pit or a special type of Hole,
(b) A permanent monitoring well, (c) A permanent remediation well, or (d) A permanent vertical dewatering well, other than a permanent Vertical dewatering well made by drilling, The person responsible for that work must promptly complete a well Closure report that contains the information required by Schedule 4 and retain that report for at least 5 years.
(11) If a well for which a well closure report is required under Subsection (9) is equipped with a well identification plate, the Well identification plate must, on the closure of the well, be Removed and returned to the comptroller along with the well Closure report referred to in subsection (9).
(12) On the closure of (a) A vertical drainage well, (b) A recharge well, other than a recharge well made by drilling, or (c) An injection well, other than an injection well made by drilling, The person responsible for that work is not required to complete a Well closure report.
(13) A temporary well does not require a well closure report.
Well caps or well covers 7 (1) If required to do so under column 5 of table 4, a well must have a Well cap.
(2) Well covers must be used for all wells, except a drainage well or Geotechnical well, that are completed below the ground surface as Shown in figure 7 of schedule 1.
(3) A person who installs a well cap or well cover for a well must (a) Use a well cap or well cover that is commercially available or Manufactured, or (b) Fabricate the well cap or well cover from durable materials having Strength suited to its location and environment.
(4) Despite subsection (3), a welded steel plate may be used as a well Cap on a well that has yet to be put into use.
(5) If there is an annular space between well casings, the annulus Must be capped or covered with a permanently installed water-tight Well cap or well cover.

= A surface seal is not required but is recommended in cases Where there is a significant potential for contaminants to Enter the well either at the time of drilling or at a later Date.
3 v = The length of the surface seal must be at least 3 feet, unless A qualified professional who has competency in the field of Hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering or an engineer under The water act confirms in writing that a lesser length will Not significantly increase the risk of a contaminant entering The well or aquifer.
Note:
If it is not desirable to have the sealant exposed at the Ground surface, the sealant may extend to within 1 foot of the Ground surface to allow for 1 foot of backfill materials but Must still have a total length at least equal to that Specified in the table.
