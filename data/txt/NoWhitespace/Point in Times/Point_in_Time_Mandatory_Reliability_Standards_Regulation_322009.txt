Section 1 definition of "bulk power system" before amended by bc reg 186/2014, effective october 7, 2014.
"bulk power system" Means
(a) Electrical generation facilities and transmission facilities, Including interconnections with neighbouring systems, that are Generally operated at voltages of 100 kilovolts or greater, and (b) Transmission facilities that are generally operated at voltages of Less than 100 kilovolts and that are, on their own or in combination With other generation, transmission or distribution facilities, Material to reliability But excludes radial transmission facilities, regardless of voltage, Serving only end-users of electricity with one transmission source; Section 1 definitions of "element", "nerc definition", "nerc Glossary, "reactive power" and "real power" were added by bc reg 186/2014, effective october 7, 2014.
Section 1 definitions of "bulk power system", "direct user", "distributor", "element", "generator", "nerc definition", "nerc Glossary", "reactive power" and "real power" before repealed by bc Reg 119/2016, effective may 18, 2016.
"bulk power system" Includes
(a) The transmission elements listed as inclusions in the nerc Definition, and (b) All transmission elements operated at 100 kilovolts or higher and Real power and reactive power resources connected at 100 kilovolts Or higher But does not include transmission elements listed as exclusions in The nerc definition; "direct user" Means
(a) An entity that enters into an agreement for transmission service, And
(b) An end-user of electricity that receives electricity from Transmission facilities at voltages of 100 kilovolts or greater; "distributor" Means an entity that receives electricity from transmission Facilities at voltages of 69 kilovolts or greater for the purpose of Serving end-users of electricity at voltages of less than 69 Kilovolts;
"element" Has the same meaning as in the nerc glossary; "generator" Means an owner or operator of an electrical generating unit or Facility;
"nerc definition" Means the definition of "bulk electric system" in the nerc glossary; "nerc glossary" Means the glossary of terms used in nerc reliability standards, by The north american electric reliability corporation and updated may 8, 2014; "reactive power" Has the same meaning as in the nerc glossary; "real power" Has the same meaning as in the nerc glossary.
Section 2 before re-enacted by bc reg 186/2014, effective october 7, 2014.
Application
2 A reliability standard adopted under section 125.2 (6) of the act Applies to all of the following:
(a) An owner or operator of a transmission facility with respect to The portion of the facility that is (i) A part of the bulk power system, or (ii) A radial transmission facility generally operated at voltages of 200 kilovolts or greater, if the reliability standard concerns Vegetation management; (b) A direct user of the bulk power system; (c) A distributor who (i) Serves greater than 25 megawatts of peak load and is directly Connected to the bulk power system, or (ii) Owns, controls or operates a facility, regardless of its size, That is part of (a) An under-frequency load shedding program, (b) An under-voltage load shedding program, (c) A special protection system, or (d) A transmission protection system Designed, installed and operated for the protection of the bulk Power system; (d) A generator with respect to all of the following:
(i) A generating unit that is greater than 20 megavolt amperes gross Nameplate rating and is directly connected to the bulk power System, unless (a) The net capacity provided to the bulk power system by the Generating unit does not exceed 20 megavolt amperes, and (b) Standby, backup and maintenance power services are provided to the Generating unit, or to end-users of electricity directly served by The generating unit, under a binding obligation with another Generator or under terms approved by the commission; (ii) A generating facility consisting of two or more generating units That are connected to the bulk power system at a common bus with a Total combined generation of the generating units of greater than 75 megavolt amperes gross aggregate nameplate rating, unless (a) The net capacity provided to the bulk power system by the facility Does not exceed 75 megavolt amperes, and (b) Standby, backup and maintenance power services are provided to the Generating facility, or to end-users of electricity directly Served by the generating facility, under a binding obligation with Another generator or under terms approved by the commission; (iii) A generating facility that is connected to the bulk power system At a common bus with one or more other generating facilities or Units, if the total combined generation of those facilities and Units is greater than 75 megavolt amperes gross aggregate Nameplate rating, unless (a) The net capacity provided to the bulk power system by the Generating facilities and units does not exceed 75 megavolt Amperes, and (b) Standby, backup and maintenance power services are provided to the Generating facilities, or to end-users of electricity directly Served by the generating facilities, under a binding obligation With another generator or under terms approved by the commission; (e) A generator with respect to a generating unit, regardless of size, That is (i) A blackstart unit material to and designated as part of a Transmission facility operator's plan for the restoration of the Bulk power system, or (ii) Material to the reliability of the bulk power system.
Section 2 before repealed by bc reg 119/2016, effective may 18, 2016.
Application
2 A reliability standard adopted under section 125.2 (6) of the act Applies to all owners, operators and direct users of an element That is part of the bulk power system.
Section 3 (1) and (2) before amended by bc reg 119/2016, effective May 18, 2016.
(1) Subject to subsection (2), a report on a reliability standard, Prepared by the transmission corporation in accordance with section 125.2 (3) of the act, must be provided to the commission within one Year of the later of the following dates:
(a) The date the reliability standard is adopted by the regulatory body With jurisdiction over the standard-making body that established the Reliability standard; (b) The date this regulation comes into force.
(2) On application by the transmission corporation, the commission may Extend the time by which the transmission corporation must provide a Report under subsection (1).
