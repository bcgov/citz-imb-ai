(1)  An insurance company authorized to carry on only life
insurance business shall establish a reserve for all unmatured
obligations under the terms of its policies dependent on life,
accident or sickness or on any other contingencies or on a term
certain.
(2)  Subject to subsection (3), the reserve shall be
calculated on the basis of a rate or rates of interest and a rate
or rates of mortality, accident, sickness or other contingencies
that, in the opinion of an actuary, are appropriate to the
circumstances of the company and the policies in force.
(3)  The reserve for a life insurance policy shall be
calculated in accordance with the methods specified in sections
124 and 125 of the
Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act
, (Canada) as those sections read on September 15, 1990, or in
accordance with any other method that produces a reserve not less,
for any policy at any duration, than the reserve calculated in
accordance with the methods specified in those sections as they
read on that date.
General insurance business

(1)  For its policies in force other than marine insurance
policies, and for claims under accident and sickness policies

following reserves:
(a) for non-cancellable accident and sickness policies in
force and for claims under accident and sickness policies payable
in installments, a reserve of at least the amount calculated on
the basis of a rate or rates of interest and a rate or rates of
mortality, accident, sickness or other contingencies that, in the
opinion of an actuary, are appropriate to the circumstances of the
company and the policies and claims being valued;
(b) for all other policies, a reserve of at least the amount
that is equal to the unearned premiums less a deduction of
whichever of the following is the least amount:

premiums, and
(b) unearned premiums shall be calculated pro rata as of the
date of the annual statement except that, where the risk insured
and the amount of insurance are not substantially uniform over the
term of the policy, the unearned premiums shall be calculated in a
manner that, in the opinion of an actuary, are appropriate to the
terms of the policy.

obligations expected to arise after the date of the return under
policies to which the reserve pertains, and

all claims and other obligations expected to arise after the date
of the return under those policies, and to pay adjustment expenses

Reduction for reinsurance

(1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the reserves

another insurer (the
"reinsurer"
).
(2)  The amount by which a reserve for any policy or group of
policies or claim may be reduced under subsection (1) shall not be
greater than the portion of that reserve that may reasonably be
considered to apply to the portion of the risk undertaken by the
reinsurer.
(3)  Where the reinsurer does not have a business
authorization to carry on insurance business and the reinsurer is
not licensed, registered or otherwise authorized to carry on the
business of insurance under the laws of a province or Canada, the
reserve
(a) for a policy or group of policies or claim in Canada
reinsured with that reinsurer may be reduced only to the extent
that adequate security is maintained in Canada for the potential
obligations of the reinsurer, and
(b) for any other policy or group of policies or claim
reinsured with that reinsurer may be reduced only to the extent
that adequate security is maintained for the potential obligations
of the reinsurer.
