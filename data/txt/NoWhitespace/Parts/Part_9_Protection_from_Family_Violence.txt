member, or on the court's own initiative, and
(b)
need not be made in conjunction with any other proceeding or claim for
relief under this Act.

A court may make an order against a family member for the protection
of another family member if the court determines that

the other family member is an at-risk family member.
(3)
An order under subsection (2) may include one or more of the
following:
(a)
a provision restraining the family member from
(i)
directly or indirectly communicating with or contacting the at-risk
family member or a specified person,
(ii)
attending at, nearing or entering a place regularly attended by the
at-risk family member, including the residence, property, business,
school or place of employment of the at-risk family member, even if
the family member owns the place, or has a right to possess the place,

possessing a weapon, a firearm or a specified object, or

If an order is made under this section at the same time as another
order is made under this Act, including an order made under Division 5
[Orders Respecting Conduct]
of Part 10, the orders must not be recorded in the same document.
Whether to make protection order
184
(1)
In determining whether to make an order under this Part, the court
must consider at least the following risk factors:
(a)
any history of family violence by the family member against whom the
order is to be made;
(b)
whether any family violence is repetitive or escalating;
(c)
whether any psychological or emotional abuse constitutes, or is
evidence of, a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed
at the at-risk family member;
(d)
the current status of the relationship between the family member
against whom the order is to be made and the at-risk family member,
including any recent separation or intention to separate;
(e)
any circumstance of the family member against whom the order is to be
made that may increase the risk of family violence by that family
member, including substance abuse, employment or financial problems,
mental health problems associated with a risk of violence, access to
weapons, or a history of violence;
(f)
the at-risk family member's perception of risks to the at-risk family
member's own safety and security;
(g)
any circumstance that may increase the at-risk family member's
vulnerability, including pregnancy, age, family circumstances, health
or economic dependence.
(2)
If family members are seeking orders under this Part against each
other, the court must consider whether the order should be made
against one person only, taking into account
(a)
the history of, and potential for, family violence,
(b)
the extent of any injuries or harm suffered, and
(c)
the respective vulnerability of the applicants.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), the person who initiates a
particular incident of family violence is not necessarily the person
against whom an order should be made.
(4)
The court may make an order under this Part regardless of whether any
of the following circumstances exist:
(a)
an order for the protection of the at-risk family member has been made
previously against the family member against whom an order is to be
made, whether or not the family member complied with the order;
(b)
the family member against whom the order is to be made is temporarily
absent from the residence;
(c)
the at-risk family member is temporarily residing in an emergency
shelter or other safe place;
(d)
criminal charges have been or may be laid against the family member
against whom the order is to be made;
(e)
the at-risk family member has a history of returning to the residence
and of living with the family member against whom the order is to be
made after family violence has occurred;
(f)
an order under section 225
[orders restricting communications]
has been made, respecting the at-risk family member, against the
family member against whom the order is to be made.
If child a family member
185
If a child is a family member, the court must consider, in addition to
the factors set out in section 184
[whether to make protection order]
,
(a)
whether the child may be exposed to family violence if an order under
this Part is not made, and
(b)
whether an order under this Part should also be made respecting the
child if an order under this Part is made respecting the child's
parent or guardian.
Orders without notice
186
(1)
An application for an order under this Part may be made without
notice.
(2)
If an order is made under this Part without notice, the court, on
application by the party against whom the order is made, may
(a)
set aside the order, or
(b)
make an order under section 187
[changing or terminating orders respecting protection]
.
Changing or terminating orders respecting protection
187
(1)
On application by a party, a court may do one or more of the following
respecting an order made under this Part:
(a)
shorten the term of the order;
(b)
extend the term of the order;
(c)
otherwise change the order;
(d)
terminate the order.
(2)
An application under this section must be made before the expiry of
the order that is the subject of the application.
(3)
Nothing in subsection (2) of this section prohibits a person from
making a subsequent application for an order under section 183
[orders respecting protection]
.
Enforcing orders respecting protection
188
(1)
An order made under this Part may not be enforced
(a)
by means of any order that may be made under this Act, or
(b)
under the
Offence Act
.
(2)
A police officer having reasonable and probable grounds to believe
that a person has contravened a term of an order made under this Part
may
(a)
take action to enforce the order, whether or not there is proof that
the order has been served on the person, and
(b)
if necessary for the purpose of paragraph (a), use reasonable force.
Conflict between orders
189
(1)
In this section,
"protection order"
means any of the following orders:
(a)
an order made under this Part;
(b)
an order, made under the
Criminal Code
, that restricts a person from contacting or communicating with
another person;
(c)
an order, made by a court in British Columbia or another jurisdiction
in Canada, that is similar in nature to an order made under this Part.
(2)
If there is a conflict or an inconsistency between a protection order
and an order made under a Part of this Act other than this Part, the
other order is suspended, to the extent of the conflict or
inconsistency, until
(a)
either the other order or the protection order is varied in such a way
that the conflict or inconsistency is eliminated, or
(b)
the protection order is terminated.
Rights not affected by Act
190
The making of an order under this Part does not affect any existing
right of action of a person who has been the subject of family
violence.

The
Enforcement of Canadian Judgments and Decrees Act
applies to an order, made by a court in another jurisdiction of
Canada, that is similar to an order made under this Part.
