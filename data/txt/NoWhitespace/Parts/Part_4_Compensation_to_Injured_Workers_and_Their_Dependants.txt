more traumatic events arising out of and in the course of the worker's
employment in that eligible occupation, unless the contrary is proved.

Subject to subsection (4), if
(a)
a worker receives compensation for permanent partial disability for
the original injury, and
(b)

a permanent disability resulting from the injury occurs, or
(b)
an increased degree of permanent disability resulting from the injury

Maximum compensation in the case of further disability
200
(1)
If a worker is receiving compensation for a permanent or temporary

date on which a worker would retire after reaching age 65 may be
made after a worker has reached age 63, and the Board may, when
making the determination, consider the worker's circumstances at the

received
(a)
compensation for permanent disability that has been wholly or partly
commuted under section 230
[commutation of periodic payments to lump sum payment]

worker before the injury if that other worker had a compensable
disability similar to the compensable disability of the applicant
worker.
(10)
A reconsideration decision under this section must not result in
periodic payments to a worker being less than they would have been if
