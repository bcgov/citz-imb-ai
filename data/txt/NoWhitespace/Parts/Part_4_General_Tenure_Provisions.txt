The holder of a timber sale licence that
(a)
has a term of less than 4 years, and
(b)
was entered into on or after November 4, 2003
may apply in writing to the timber sales manager for an extension of
the term of the licence for a period that
(c)
does not exceed one year, and
(d)
does not result in a term of more than 4 years for that licence.
(2)
The holder of a cutting permit that
(a)
has a term of less than 4 years,
(b)
is not issued under a licence to cut, and
(c)
was entered into on or after November 4, 2003
may apply in writing to the district manager for an extension of the
term of the permit for a period that
(d)
does not exceed one year, and
(e)
does not result in a term of more than 4 years for that permit.
(3)
Subject to subsection (8), the timber sales manager or district
manager must accept an application under subsection (1) or (2) if
(a)
the timber sale licence or the agreement under which the cutting
permit was issued, does not prohibit the extensions,
(b)
rights under the timber sale licence or the cutting permit are not
under suspension, and
(c)
the holder of the timber sale licence or cutting permit has paid to
the government a fee equal to the amount determined under subsection
(5) and, if applicable, subsection (5.1).
(4)
On the date of acceptance of an application under subsection (3), the
term of the timber sale licence or cutting permit, as the case may be,
is extended in accordance with the application.
(5)
The fee referred to in subsection (3) (c)
(a)
for a timber sale licence for which there was a bonus bid is a fee
equal to a prescribed percentage of an amount calculated according to
the following formula:
[(the bonus bid) + (the upset stumpage rate)] ×
the volume or estimated volume of timber, as
applicable, that was advertised in the invitation
for applications for the licence
or
(b)
for a timber sale licence for which there was a bonus offer is a fee
equal to a prescribed percentage of an amount calculated according to
the following formula:
[the bonus offer] +
(the upset stumpage rate) ×
(the volume or estimated volume of timber, as
applicable, that was advertised in the invitation
for applications for the licence)
and
(c)
for a cutting permit is a fee equal to a prescribed amount or equal to
an amount determined in accordance with one or more prescribed
formulas.

If the holder of a timber sale licence harvested timber under the
licence before applying to extend the term of the licence under
subsection (1), the fee payable under subsection (5) (a) or (b) is
reduced, to a maximum of 90%, by the percentage derived from the
following formula:
the volume of timber harvested under the licence
on or before the date of application as
determined by the timber sales manager
× 100
the volume or estimated volume of timber,
as applicable, that was advertised in the
invitation for applications for the licence
(6)
However, at the request of the holder of a timber sale licence or
cutting permit who has submitted an application for an extension under
subsection (1) or (2), the minister or a person authorized by the
minister may waive the fee referred to in subsection (3) (c), if the
minister or authorized person is satisfied that the reasons for the
extension are circumstances
(a)
beyond the holder's control, and
(b)
unrelated to the holder's financial situation.
(6.1)
A request referred to in subsection (6) must
(a)
be submitted within 30 days after the date an application for an
extension under subsection (1) or (2) is made,
(b)
be signed by, or on behalf of, the requesting person, and
(c)
specify the reasons for the request.
(7)
A fee paid under subsection (3) (c) must not be credited towards
stumpage.
(8)
The timber sales manager or district manager may refuse to accept an
application to extend the term of a timber sale licence or cutting
permit under subsection (3) if, in his or her opinion, the extension
would prevent the fulfillment of an obligation under the
Forest and Range Practices Act
or the
Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act
.
(9)
The term of a timber sale licence or cutting permit to which this
section applies must not be extended except in accordance with this

sale of Crown timber on that land would neither affect the licensee's
ability to manage the tree farm licence area in accordance with the
management plan nor adversely affect other natural resources, Crown
timber within the tree farm licence may be disposed of to a person
other than the holder of the tree farm licence under
(i)
a forestry licence to cut, or

that portions of the allowable annual cut for the tree farm licence
are to be harvested from different types of timber or terrain in
different parts of Crown land or private land within the tree farm
licence area or from different areas of Crown land within the tree
farm licence area and the holder of the tree farm licence fails to
harvest a portion of the allowable annual cut so specified, the chief
forester, in a notice served on the holder, may reduce the allowable
annual cut available to the holder by a volume equal to the specified
portion that was not so harvested.
(2)
Crown timber within the tree farm licence area may be disposed of
under this Act to persons other than the holder of the tree farm
licence under
(a)
a forestry licence to cut, or

in a volume that does not exceed the reduction under subsection (1).
(3)
If a replaceable forest licence provides that part of the allowable
annual cut of the licence is to be harvested from a specified part of
a licence area, from a specified type of timber or from a specified
type of terrain and the holder of the licence fails to comply with
that provision, the minister or a person authorized by the minister,

authorized in the licence by a volume equal to the volume that was not
so harvested.

other licences must be determined by multiplying that volume by the
fraction obtained by dividing the allowable annual cut of that other
