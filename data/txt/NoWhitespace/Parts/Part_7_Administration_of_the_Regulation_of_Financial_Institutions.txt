appropriate.
(4)
The failure of the person entitled under subsection (3) (b) to be
present or represented by counsel during the examination or to examine
the person referred to in subsection (3) (a) does not
prevent the superintendent from reading in the evidence at the hearing
if the examination has otherwise been conducted in accordance with the

(5)
The superintendent must send the letter of request,
(a)
if the examination is to be held in Canada, to the Deputy Attorney

letter of request and to pay them on receiving notification of the
amount.
(8)
This section does not limit any power the superintendent may have to
obtain evidence outside British Columbia by any other means.
(9)
The making of an order by a judicial authority referred to in
subsection (1) in accordance with a letter of request issued under
that subsection does not determine whether evidence obtained under the
order is admissible in evidence in a hearing before the
superintendent.
(10)
Unless otherwise provided by this section, the practice and procedure
in connection with appointing a person, conducting an examination and
certifying and returning the appointment under this section are, as
