charge claimed if the registrar is of the opinion that

registrable under this Act.
Registration of person creating charge

Floating charges on land
203
(1)
In this section:
"circular priority"
means the situation where 3 or more competing charges have been
registered against the same parcel of land and the application of
subsections (9) and (10) leads to a priority relationship among them
in which each charge is subordinate in priority to at least one of the
other charges;
"crystallized"
, with reference to a floating charge, means a charge that has fixed
on specific land in accordance with the applicable law and the terms
of the instrument in which the charge is created;
"financing statement"
has the same meaning as in the
Personal Property Security Act
;
"floating charge"
means a charge that secures the payment or performance of an
obligation and that does not become a fixed charge on specific land
until the occurrence of an event, stipulated in the instrument that
created the floating charge.
(2)
The personal property registry established under the
Personal Property Security Act
is the proper office for registration of an uncrystallized floating
charge.
(3)
An uncrystallized floating charge may be registered in the personal
property registry by registering a financing statement in the form and
manner prescribed under the
Personal Property Security Act
.
(4)
If a floating charge and a security interest in personal property are
created by the same instrument, registration with respect to that
security interest under the
Personal Property Security Act
also constitutes registration of the floating charge under subsection
(3).
(5)
Sections 18, 43 (1) to (9), (12) to (15), 44 to 48 and 51 to 54 of the
Personal Property Security Act
apply to an uncrystallized floating charge registered in the personal
property registry.
(6)
An application to register a crystallized floating charge in a land
title office must be accompanied by proof, in the form of a signed
statement satisfactory to the registrar, stating
(a)
that the charge has crystallized, and
(b)
the circumstances under which the crystallization occurred.
(7)
Registration of a crystallized floating charge does not constitute a
determination by the registrar that crystallization has occurred.
(8)
Except as provided in subsection (6), the registrar must not register
a floating charge.
(9)
The priority of a crystallized floating charge registered under
section 197 must be determined under sections 27
and 28.
(10)
Despite subsection (9), priority between crystallized floating charges
that charge the same parcel of land must be determined by the date of
registration under subsection (3) or section 197, whichever
is the earlier.
(11)
If a circular priority exists, the rights of the parties must be
resolved by allowing the person having priority under subsection (10)
to pursue the person's claim as if the person were subrogated to the
claim of the person otherwise having priority under subsection (9).
(12)
The priority of a floating charge registered against a specific parcel
of land before October 1, 1990 must be determined without
regard to this section.
(13)
An uncrystallized floating charge that, immediately before
October 1, 1990, was covered by an unexpired registration
under section 75 of the
Company Act
, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 59, is deemed to be registered under subsection
(3).
(14)
A deemed registration under subsection (13) expires 3 years from
October 1, 1990, but may be continued by registration under subsection
(3) or (4) before the expiry of the 3 years.
Registration of debt to the government as a charge
204
There may be registered in the same manner as a charge is registered,

debtor to the government unless it is registered.
Writ of affecting land
205
(1)
A sheriff, after delivery to the sheriff of a writ affecting land may,
on behalf of the Crown for the purpose of enforcing or recovery of a
debt due to the Crown, apply to register, in the same manner as a
charge is registered, a copy of the writ against the title to the land
registered in the name of the debtor.
(2)
The copy of the writ referred to in subsection (1) must be certified
as a true copy by the sheriff or the registrar of the issuing court.
(3)
If a writ is not registered, a purchaser in good faith of the land of
the debtor to the Crown takes free of it.
(4)
Sections 212 and 213 apply to a writ registered under this section as
if the writ were a judgment.
Registration of transfer, extension or modification of charges
206
(1)
On application being made for registration of a transfer, extension or
modification of a charge, the registrar, on being satisfied that all
necessary parties have joined in it, must register the transfer,
extension or modification by endorsing it in the register as a
separate entry or as a note against the original entry or both, using
the number and date of the application for registration and an
appropriate symbol or abbreviation indicating the nature and effect of
the instrument registered.
(2)
Unless the holder is a party to it, a modification of a charge does
not affect the holder of a charge registered before the registration
of the modification.
Form of postponement
207
(1)
A registered owner of a charge, in this section referred to as the
"prior charge", may postpone that person's rights under it by
executing an instrument in the form approved by the director or in
another form that may be acceptable to the registrar and, when in the
approved form and registered, the instrument operates to postpone that
person's rights to those of the registered owner of the subsequent
charge designated in the instrument in the same manner and to the same
extent as if the prior charge had been registered immediately after
the registration of the subsequent charge.
(2)
[Repealed 1997-45-51.]
Certificates of charge
208

by the owner of it, issue to the owner a certificate of charge in the
appropriate form approved by the director, and make an endorsement of
its issue in the register.

the certificate of charge must be surrendered to the registrar for
cancellation; but if there is
(a)
a partial release, extension or modification of the charge, or
(b)
a postponement of the charge to another charge,
the certificate of charge must be delivered to the registrar who must,
after noting on it particulars of the dealing, return the certificate
to the person entitled to it.
(3)

charge, other than to minerals, if satisfactory evidence of its loss
or destruction is filed with the registrar.

This section applies to judgments registered or renewed and assigned
after October 30, 1979.

interest and costs, and all other securities to be derived from the

(a)
registration as an owner of an estate in fee simple or an estate or

applicant's land,

registered or as to the charge so cancelled.
Costs on failure to establish priority

which the applicant for registration or cancellation is claiming is
entitled to priority over the judgment creditor's registered judgment,
the court may
(a)
dismiss the proceedings without costs, or

(2.1)
The minister may delegate to the Surveyor General the minister's
powers under subsection (1) (d).
(3)
Registration of an instrument granting or otherwise creating a

confers on the grantee the right to use the land charged in accordance
with the terms of the instrument, and the terms, conditions and
covenants expressed in the instrument are binding on and take effect
to the benefit of the grantor and grantee and their successors in
title, unless a contrary intention appears.

is created is not liable for a breach of a covenant in the instrument
occurring after the person has ceased to be the owner of the land.
(5)
This section is retroactive in its application and applies to all
statutory rights of way, whenever created.
(6)
A recital in a grant or reservation of a statutory right of way that

apportionment of the obligations under the covenant as between the
owners of the land affected, and
(b)
a rent charge charging the land affected and payable by the covenantor
and the covenantor's successors in title.

the covenant is binding on the covenantor and the covenantor's
successors in title, even though the instrument or other disposition
has not been signed by the covenantee.

covenant under subsection (9.1), an approving officer may exercise the
powers provided under section 86 (1) (d), whether or not the
modification or discharge is related to an application for subdivision
approval.
(10)
The registration of a covenant under this section is not a
determination by the registrar of its enforceability.
(11)
On the death or dissolution of an owner of a covenant registrable
under subsection (3) (c), the covenant ceases to be enforceable by any
person, including the Crown, other than
(a)
another covenantee named in the instrument creating the covenant, or

an assignee of a covenantee if the assignment has been approved in
writing by the minister.
(12)
If a covenantee or assignee referred to in subsection (11) is a
corporation that has been dissolved and subsequently restored into
existence under an enactment of British Columbia, the covenant
continues to be enforceable by the restored corporation from the date
of its restoration.
(13)
A recital in a covenant that a person "has been designated by the
minister under section 219 (3) (c) of the
Land Title Act
", or a statement to that effect in the application to register the
covenant, is sufficient proof to a registrar of that fact.

(a)
the owner,
(b)
each purchaser, lessee and sublessee of all or part of the land, and
(c)
each successor in title, future purchaser, lessee and sublessee of the
land
subject to the restrictions and confer on them the benefits of the

records accordingly.

the land to which the benefit of the covenant is annexed and the land
subject to the burden of the covenant are both satisfactorily
described in the instrument creating the covenant, and

A covenant that, directly or indirectly, restricts the sale,
ownership, occupation or use of land on account of the sex, race,

the burden of the easement is increased accordingly, even though the
owner of the servient tenement has not consented to the increase, and
