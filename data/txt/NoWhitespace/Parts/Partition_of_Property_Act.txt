Partition of Property Act
[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 347
Definitions
1
In this Act:
"court"
means the Supreme Court;
"land"
includes special timber licences, and all estates and interests in
them;
"proceeding for partition"
includes a proceeding for sale and distribution of the proceeds.
Parties may be compelled to partition or sell land
2
(1)
All joint tenants, tenants in common, coparceners, mortgagees or other
creditors who have liens on, and all parties interested in any land
may be compelled to partition or sell the land, or a part of it as
provided in this Act.
(2)
Subsection (1) applies whether the estate is legal or equitable or
equitable only.
(3)
In order to achieve partition, special timber licences may be assigned
to any of the interested parties.
(4)
Despite subsection (3), a special timber licence must not be
partitioned and any special timber licences left over after the others
have been assigned, must be ordered to be sold and the proceeds
distributed among the interested parties in order to achieve
partition.
Pleadings
3
In a proceeding for partition it is sufficient to claim a sale and
distribution of proceeds, and it is not necessary to claim a
partition.
Parties to proceeding and persons entitled to notice
4
(1)
Any person who, if this Act had not been passed, might have maintained
a proceeding for partition may maintain such a proceeding against any
one or more of the interested parties without serving the other or
others, and a defendant in the proceeding may not object for want of
parties.
(2)
The court may order inquiries as to the nature of the property, the
persons interested in it and other matters it thinks necessary or
proper, with a view to an order for partition or sale being made on
further consideration, but all persons who, if this Act had not been
passed, would have been necessary parties to the proceeding must be
served with a notice of the order.
(3)
Persons served with notice under subsection (2)
(a)
are bound by the proceeding as if they had been originally parties to
the proceeding,
(b)
may participate in the proceeding, and
(c)
may apply to the court to amend the order.
Proceedings if parties cannot be served
5
(1)
If in a proceeding for partition it appears to the court that a copy
of an order under section 4 cannot be served on the interested
parties, or cannot be served without expense disproportionate to the
value of the property involved, the court may, if it thinks fit, on
the request of any of the interested parties and despite the dissent
or disability of any of them
(a)
dispense with service on any person or class of persons specified in
the order, and
(b)
order that notice of the order be published at the times and in the
manner the court thinks fit, calling on all persons interested in the
property who have not been served to apply to establish their claims
before the court within a period specified in the order.
(2)
After the period specified in an order under subsection (1),
(a)
all persons who have not applied to establish their claims, whether
they are in or out of the jurisdiction of the court, including persons
under any disability, are bound by the proceedings as if on the day of
the date of the order dispensing with service they had been served
with a copy of the order under section 4,
(b)
the powers of the court under the
Trustee Act
extend to the interests of persons referred to in paragraph (a) in the
property involved as if they had been parties, and
(c)
the court may order a sale of the property and give directions.
Sale of property where majority requests it
6
In a proceeding for partition where, if this Act had not been passed,
an order for partition might have been made, and if the party or
parties interested, individually or collectively, to the extent of 1/2
or upwards in the property involved request the court to direct a sale
of the property and a distribution of the proceeds instead of a
division of the property, the court must, unless it sees good reason
to the contrary, order a sale of the property and may give directions.
Sale in place of partition
7
In a proceeding for partition where, if this Act had not been passed,
an order for partition might have been made, and if it appears to the
court that because of the nature of the property involved, or of the
number of parties interested or presumptively interested in it, or of
the absence or disability of some of those parties, or of any other
circumstance, a sale of the property and a distribution of the
proceeds would be more beneficial for the interested parties than a
division of the property, the court may
(a)
on the request of any of the interested parties and despite the
dissent or disability of any other interested party, order a sale of
the property, and
(b)
give directions.
Purchase of share of person applying for sale
8
(1)
In a proceeding for partition where, if this Act had not been passed,
an order for partition might have been made, then if any party
interested in the property involved requests the court to order a sale
of the property and a distribution of the proceeds instead of a
division of the property, the court may order a sale of the property
and give directions.
(2)
The court may not make an order under subsection (1) if the other
parties interested in the property, or some of them, undertake to
purchase the share of a party requesting a sale.
(3)
If an undertaking is given, the court may order a valuation of the
share of the party requesting a sale in the manner the court thinks
fit, and may give directions.
Persons under disability
9
(1)
In a proceeding for partition, a request for sale may be made or an
undertaking to purchase given on the part of an infant, of an adult
who is incapable of making decisions relating to the adult's financial
affairs or of a person under any other disability, by
(a)
the infant's litigation guardian or guardian,
(b) and (c)
[Not in force.]
(d)
the adult's attorney under an enduring power of attorney.
(2)
The court is not bound to comply with the request or undertaking on
the part of an infant unless it appears that the sale or purchase will
be for the infant's benefit.
Court may allow interested parties to bid
10
On a sale under this Act the court may allow any of the interested
parties to bid at the sale on the terms as to nonpayment of deposit,
or setting off or accounting for the purchase money instead of paying
it, or as to any other matter that seems reasonable to the court.
Money arising from sale subject to court order
11
(1)
All money to be received on any sale under this Act, or to be set
aside out of the rents or payments reserved, on any lease of earth,
coal, stone or minerals may, if the court orders, be paid to any
trustees approved by the court.
(2)
If no order is made under subsection (1), the money must be paid into
a chartered bank as the court directs, to the account of the registrar
of the court in the matter of this Act.
(3)
Money paid under subsection (1) or (2) must be applied, as the court
directs, to one or more of the following purposes:
(a)
the discharge or redemption of any encumbrance affecting the property
in respect of which the money was paid, or affecting any other
property, subject to the same uses or trusts;
(b)
the purchase of other property to be settled in the same manner as the
property in respect of which the money was paid;
(c)
the payment to any person becoming absolutely entitled.
Application of money without court order
12
The application of money referred to in section 11 may, if the
court so orders, be made by the trustees, if any, without application
to the court, or otherwise on an order of the court, on the petition
of the person who would be entitled to the possession or the receipt
of the rents and profits of the land if the money had been invested in
the purchase of land.
Investment of money
13
(1)
Until the money can be applied as required under this Act, it must be
invested as the court thinks fit.
(2)
The interest and dividends of the investment must be paid to the
persons who would have been entitled to the rents and profits of the
land if the money had been invested in the purchase of land.
Interests of persons if service of notice dispensed with
14
(1)
If an order is made under this Act dispensing with the service of
notice on any person or classes of persons, and property is sold by
order of the court, the following provisions apply:
(a)
the proceeds of the sale must be paid into court to await the further
order of the court;
(b)
the court must, by order, set a time after which the proceeds will be
distributed, and may by further order extend that time;
(c)
the court must order notice to be given by advertisements or otherwise
to any persons on whom service is dispensed with who may not have
previously come in and established their claims, notifying them of
(i)
the fact of the sale,
(ii)
the time of the intended distribution, and
(iii)
the time within which a claim to participate in the proceeds must be
made;
(d)
if at the end of the time set or extended the interests of all the
persons interested have been ascertained, the court must distribute
the proceeds in accordance with the rights of those persons;
(e)
if at the end of the time set or extended the interests of all the
persons interested have not been ascertained, and it appears to the
court that they cannot be ascertained or cannot be ascertained without
expense disproportionate to the value of the property or of the
unascertained interests, the court must distribute the proceeds
(i)
in the manner that appears to the court to be most in accordance with
the rights of the persons whose claims to participate in the proceeds
have been established, whether all those persons are or are not before
the court, and
(ii)
with the reservations, if any, the court sees fit in favour of any
other persons, whether ascertained or not, who may appear from the
evidence before the court to have any clear rights that ought to be
provided for, although those rights may not have been fully
established.
(2)
If an order is made under subsection (1) (e), all other persons are
excluded from participation in those proceeds.
(3)
Despite a distribution under subsection (1) of the proceeds of a sale,
any person excluded under subsection (2) may recover from any
participating person any portion received by that person of the
excluded person's share.
Abatement in favour of parties previously excluded
15
If 2 or more sales are made in a proceeding for partition and any
person who has been excluded under this Act from participation in the
proceeds of any of those sales establishes a claim to participate in
the proceeds of a subsequent sale, the shares of the other persons
interested in the proceeds of the subsequent sale
(a)
abate to the extent, if any, to which they were increased by the
non-participation of the excluded person in the proceeds of the
previous sale, and
(b)
must to that extent be applied in payment to that person of the share
to which the person would have been entitled in the proceeds of the
previous sale if the claim to it had been established in time.
Costs
16
In a proceeding for partition the court may make an order it thinks
just respecting costs up to the time of hearing.
Application of
Land Title Act
17
An order for the partition of land into 2 or more parcels is deemed to
effect a subdivision as defined in the
Land Title Act
and must contain an express declaration that the order is subject to
compliance with that Act.
