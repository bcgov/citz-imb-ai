[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 157
Part 7 — Payments to the Government
Amount of stumpage
103
(1)
Subject to sections 107, 108 and 142.7, if stumpage under section 104
or under an agreement entered into under this Act is payable to the
government in respect of Crown timber, the amount payable must be
calculated by multiplying the volume or quantity of the timber
(a)
reported in a scale made under Part 6, or
(b)
calculated using the information required to be submitted to the
government under section 106 (2)
by the sum of
(c)
the rate of stumpage applicable to the timber under section 105, and
(d)
if applicable, the bonus bid offered in respect of the timber.
(2)
Nothing in subsection (1) limits a requirement under this Act, or
under an agreement entered into under this Act, to pay a bonus offer.
(3)
Despite sections 107 and 108 but subject to section 142.7, a person
who cuts, damages, destroys or removes Crown timber without
authorization must pay, in addition to all other amounts payable under
this Act or another enactment, stumpage calculated by multiplying the
volume or quantity of the timber that was cut, damaged, destroyed or
removed without authorization, as determined by an official designated
by the minister, by the sum of
(a)
the rate of stumpage that an employee of the ministry referred to in
section 105 (1) determines would likely have applied to the timber
under that section if rights to the timber had been granted under an
agreement entered into under this Act, and
(b)
if applicable, the bonus bid that an employee of the ministry referred
to in section 105 (1) determines would likely have been offered for
the timber if rights to the timber had been granted under an agreement
entered into under this Act.
Assessments for merchantable Crown timber that is not cut and removed
103.1
(1)
If an agreement entered into under this Act specifies that waste
assessments are payable to the government in respect of merchantable
Crown timber that could have been cut and removed under the agreement,
but, at the agreement holder's discretion, is not cut and removed, the
amount payable must be calculated in accordance with the agreement.
(2)
Subject to subsection (3), a requirement in an agreement entered into
under this Act, or in a cutting permit issued under that agreement, is
without effect to the extent that it requires the holder of the
agreement or permit, on or after the date this section comes into
force, to cut and remove timber in accordance with the agreement or
permit.
(3)
If an agreement or a cutting permit referred to in subsection (2)
requires its holder to pay an amount determined in accordance with the
agreement or the cutting permit for timber that is not cut and removed
in accordance with the agreement or the cutting permit, the holder
must pay the amount required to be paid under the agreement or the
cutting permit.
(4)
Despite subsections (1) to (3), the Lieutenant Governor in Council may
make regulations specifying circumstances under which waste
assessments are payable to the government in respect of merchantable
Crown timber that could have been cut and removed under the agreement
but, at the agreement holder's discretion, is not cut and removed.
(5)
If a provision in an agreement entered into under this Act conflicts
or is inconsistent with a regulation made under subsection (4), the
regulation prevails.
Stumpage rate for timber licence
104
(1)
Despite any other Act, any election made under section 23 of the
Forest Act
, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 140, before the repeal of that section, or any
agreement, the holder of a timber licence must pay stumpage to the
government at rates determined under section 105 for timber that is
cut under the licence and scaled.
(2)
Despite another Act or a grant of Crown land, no royalty is reserved
or payable to the government in respect of timber cut from private
land and scaled after January 1, 1979.
(3)
Despite subsection (1), no stumpage is payable in respect of timber
cut on land granted by Canada by letters patent and situated within
the Railway Belt or Peace River Block.
Stumpage rate determined

(1)
Subject to the regulations made under subsection (6) and orders under
subsection (7), if stumpage is payable to the government under an
agreement entered into under this Act or under section 103 (3), the

procedures referred to in paragraph (c),
(b)
at the times specified by the minister, and

A regulation under subsection (1.1) may be different for different
timber, places, transactions or holders of agreements entered into
under this Act.
(2)
Rates, policies and procedures under subsection (1) may be different
for different timber, places, transactions or holders of agreements
entered into under this Act, and the policies and procedures referred
to in subsection (1) may, for stumpage paid or payable in respect of
timber cut under a cutting authority issued after July 31, 2005,
provide that the determination, redetermination or variation of a rate
of stumpage is effective at any date, including, without limitation,
at any date before or after
(a)
the harvesting or scaling of the timber in respect of which the
stumpage has been or is to be paid, or
(b)
the payment of stumpage based on any earlier determined, redetermined
or varied rate of stumpage.
(2.1)
For the purposes of subsection (2),
"cutting authority"
has the same meaning as in the policies and procedures approved under
subsection (1) (c).
(3)

subsection (6) and orders under subsection (7), the holder of a timber
licence must pay stumpage to the government at a percentage of the

The percentage referred to in subsection (3) is
(a)
100% of the rates referred to as "miscellaneous stumpage rates", in
policies and procedures approved from time to time by the minister
under subsection (1), and
(b)
for rates not referred to in paragraph (a), the percentage set out in
column 2 opposite the time period in column 1 in which the stumpage
rate is determined.

(ii)
did not exist when the stumpage rate was determined, redetermined or

stumpage rate that is different from the earlier determined,
redetermined or varied stumpage rate.
(4)
A direction of the minister under this section may be made at any
time,
(a)
whether the earlier determined, redetermined or varied stumpage rate
is still in effect or has expired, and
(b)
whether before or after stumpage is paid in respect of the timber to

special account established by the
Special Accounts Appropriation and Control Act
.
Cruise instead of scale
106
(1)
The amount of stumpage payable on Crown timber
(a)
may, with the approval of the minister, or
(b)
must, in the circumstances provided for in the policies and procedures
referred to in section 105 (1) (c),
be calculated using the information provided by a cruise of the timber
conducted before the timber is cut, instead of the volume reported in
a scale of the timber made under Part 6.
(2)
For the purposes of calculating the amount of stumpage payable using
information provided by a cruise of the timber conducted before the
timber is cut, the minister may require the holder of an agreement to
submit the following information to the government:
(a)
some or all of the information provided by the cruise of the timber;
(b)
an estimate, in hectares, of the size of the area from which the
timber is cut;
(c)
any other information the minister considers necessary.
(3)
The holder of an agreement who is required under subsection (2) to
submit information to the government must submit the information in
the manner and at the times required by the minister.
More than one rate
107
If the minister considers it appropriate and more than one stumpage
rate applies to timber cut in a timber harvesting operation, a single
rate of stumpage, calculated as the average of the rates that
otherwise would be applicable and weighted according to the respective
volumes of timber estimated by the minister to be subject to each
rate, is payable on the timber.
Rate on unscaled or incorrectly scaled timber
108
Subject to section 142.7, if Crown timber on which royalty or stumpage
is payable is
(a)
processed,
(b)
sold, or
(c)
removed from British Columbia
without first being scaled correctly under Part 6, the amount of
royalty or stumpage payable must be calculated by multiplying the
minister's estimate of the volume or quantity of the timber by the
rate of royalty or stumpage, as the case may be, that the minister
considers would have applied if the timber had been scaled correctly
under Part 6.
