Duty of registrar to provide records affecting land in new district
8
(1)
If a new land title district is established or the boundaries of a
land title district are enlarged, the registrar of each land title
district from which land comprised in the new or enlarged land title
district is separated must
(a)
provide to the registrar of the new or enlarged land title district
originals or certified copies of those portions of the records
affecting the land in the new or enlarged land title district, and
(b)
if the records have been microfilmed, supply the original or a
certified copy of the microfilm.
(2)
The originals or certified copies referred to in subsection (1) are
for all purposes of the same effect, when deposited in the office of
the land title office of the new or enlarged land title district, as
if they or the originals of which any of them purport to be copies had
been originally registered, deposited, filed or kept in that office.
(3)
If an original record contains entries affecting land in a new or
enlarged land title district as well as land in the old land title
district, the registrar of the old land title district may, instead of
providing certified copies, cause those portions of the original
record relating to land in the old land title district to be copied
and certified, and the copies to be retained in that office, and may
provide the original record to the registrar of the new or enlarged
land title district.
(4)
The copies retained under subsection (3) by the registrar of the old
land title district are for all purposes of the same effect as the
originals of which they are copies.
