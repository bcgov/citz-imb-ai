Termination of contract by court

a person whose life is insured under a contract is someone other than
the insured, and
(b)
the person reasonably believes that their life or health might be
endangered by the insurance on their life continuing under that
contract,
on application of that person, the court may make the orders the court
considers just in the circumstances.
(2)
Without limiting subsection (1), the orders that the court may make

an order that the insurance on that person's life under the contract
be terminated in accordance with the terms of the contract, other than

(4)
Despite subsection (3), if the court considers it just to do so, the

insurance, the insured.
(5)
An order made under subsection (1) binds any person having an interest
in the contract.
When contract takes effect
48
(1)
Subject to a provision to the contrary in the application or the
policy, a contract does not take effect unless
(a)
the policy is delivered to an insured, the insured's assign or agent,
or to a beneficiary,
(b)
payment of the initial premium is made to the insurer or its agent,
and
(c)
no change has taken place in the insurability of the life to be
insured between the time the application was completed and the time
the policy was delivered.
(2)
If a policy is issued on the terms applied for and is delivered to an
agent of the insurer for unconditional delivery to a person referred
to in subsection (1) (a), it is deemed, but not to the prejudice of
the insured, to have been delivered to the insured.
Payment of premiums
49
(1)
If a cheque or other bill of exchange, or a promissory note or other
written promise to pay, is given for the whole or a part of a premium
and the cheque, bill of exchange, promissory note or other promise to
pay is not honoured according to its tenor, the premium or the part of
the premium has not been paid.
(2)
If a remittance for or on account of a premium is sent in a registered
letter to an insurer and is received by it, the remittance is deemed
to have been received at the time of the registration of the letter.
Payment of premiums and grace periods
50
(1)
Except in the case of group insurance or creditor's group insurance,
an assignee of a contract, a beneficiary or a person acting on behalf
of one of them or of the insured may pay any premium that the insured
is entitled to pay.
(2)
If a premium, other than the initial premium, is not paid at the time
it is due, the premium may be paid within a period of grace of
(a)
30 days, or in the case of an industrial contract 28 days, from
and excluding the day on which the premium is due, or
(b)
the number of days, if any, specified in the contract for payment of
an overdue premium,
whichever is the longer period.
(3)
If the happening of the event on which the insurance money becomes
payable occurs during the period of grace and before the overdue
premium is paid, the contract is deemed to be in effect as if the
premium had been paid at the time it was due, and, except in the case
of group insurance or creditor's group insurance, the amount of the
premium may be deducted from the insurance money.
Duty to disclose
51
(1)
An applicant for insurance and a person whose life is to be insured
must each disclose to the insurer in the application, on a medical
examination, if any, and in any written statements or answers
furnished as evidence of insurability, every fact within the
applicant's or person's knowledge that is material to the insurance
and is not so disclosed by the other.
(2)
Subject to section 52 and subsection (3) of this section, a failure to
disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact referred to in subsection
(1) renders the contract voidable by the insurer.
(3)
A failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact referred to
in subsection (1) relating to evidence of insurability with respect to
an application for
(a)
additional coverage under a contract,
(b)
an increase in insurance under a contract, or
(c)
any other change to insurance after the policy is issued
renders the contract voidable by the insurer, but only in relation to
the addition, increase or change.
Failure to disclose
52
(1)
This section does not apply to
(a)
a misstatement to an insurer of the age of a person whose life is
insured, or
(b)
insurance under which an insurer, as part of a contract, undertakes to
pay insurance money or to provide other benefits in the event the
person whose life is insured becomes disabled as a result of bodily
injury or disease.
(2)
Subject to subsection (3), if a contract, or an addition, increase or
change referred to in section 51 (3), has been in effect for 2 years
during the lifetime of the person whose life is insured, a failure to
disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact required to be disclosed
by section 51 does not, in the absence of fraud, render the contract
voidable.
(3)
In the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group
insurance, a failure to disclose, or a misrepresentation of, a fact
required by section 51 to be disclosed in respect of a person whose
life is insured under the contract does not render the contract
voidable, but
(a)
if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of
insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of
application for the insurance in respect of the person, the insurance
in respect of that person is voidable by the insurer, and
(b)
if the failure to disclose or misrepresentation relates to evidence of
insurability specifically requested by the insurer at the time of
application for an addition, increase or change referred to in section
51 (3) in respect of the person, the addition, increase or change in
respect of that person is voidable by the insurer,
unless the insurance, addition, increase or change has been in effect
for 2 years during the lifetime of that person, in which case the
insurance, addition, increase or change is not, in the absence of
fraud, voidable.
Nondisclosure by insurer
53
If an insurer fails to disclose or misrepresents a fact material to
the insurance, the contract is voidable by the insured, but in the
absence of fraud the contract is not by reason of such failure or
misrepresentation voidable after the contract has been in effect for
2 years.
Misstatement of age
54
(1)
This section does not apply to a contract of group insurance or of
creditor's group insurance.
(2)
Subject to subsection (3), if the age of a person whose life is
insured is misstated to the insurer, the insurance money provided by
the contract must be increased or decreased to the amount that would
have been provided for the same premium at the correct age.
(3)
If a contract limits insurable age and the correct age of the person
whose life is insured exceeds that limit at the date of the
application, the contract is voidable by the insurer for 5 years after
the date the contract takes effect, but not afterwards, and only if
(a)
that person is alive, and
(b)
the insurer voids the contract within 60 days after it discovers the
misstatement of age.
Misstatement of age in group insurance
55
In the case of a contract of group insurance or of creditor's group
insurance, a misstatement to the insurer of the age of a person whose
life is insured does not of itself render the contract voidable, and
the provisions, if any, of the contract with respect to age or
misstatement of age apply.
Effect of suicide on contract
56
(1)
If a contract contains an undertaking, express or implied, that
insurance money will be paid if a person whose life is insured commits
suicide, the undertaking is lawful and enforceable.
(2)
If a contract provides that in case a person whose life is insured
commits suicide within a certain period of time the contract is void
or the amount payable under it is reduced, if the contract lapses and
is subsequently reinstated on one or more occasions, the period of
time begins to run from the date of the latest reinstatement.
Reinstatement of contract
57
(1)
This section does not apply to a contract of group insurance or
creditor's group insurance or to a contract made by a fraternal
society.
(2)
If a contract lapses at the end of a period of grace because a premium
due at the beginning of the period of grace was not paid, the contract
may be reinstated by payment of the overdue premium within a further
period of 30 days after the end of the period of grace, but only if
the person whose life was insured under the contract is alive at the
time payment is made.
(3)
If a contract lapses and is not reinstated under subsection (2), the
insurer must reinstate it if, within 2 years after the date the
contract lapsed, the insured
(a)
applies for the reinstatement,
(b)
pays to the insurer all overdue premiums and other indebtedness under
the contract, together with interest not exceeding the rate determined
under section 7 of the
Court Order Interest Act
, and
(c)
produces evidence satisfactory to the insurer of the good health and
insurability of the person whose life was insured.
(4)
Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the cash surrender value has
been paid or an option of taking paid up or extended insurance has
been exercised.
(5)
Sections 51 and 52 apply, so far as applicable and with the necessary
changes, to reinstatement of a contract.
Termination and replacement of group policies
58
(1)
If a contract of group insurance, or a benefit provision in a contract
of group insurance, under which the insurer undertakes to pay
insurance money or provide other benefits if a group life insured
becomes disabled as a result of bodily injury or disease is
terminated, the insurer continues, as though the contract or benefit
provision had remained in full force and effect, to be liable to pay
insurance money or provide benefits in respect of a group life insured
for liability arising from an accident or disease that occurred before
the termination of the contract or benefit provision if the disability
is reported to the insurer within the 6 month period following the
termination or a longer continuous period specified in the contract.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), an insurer does not remain liable under a
contract or benefit provision described in that subsection to pay
insurance money or provide a benefit for the recurrence of a
disability after both of the following occur:
(a)
the termination of the contract or benefit provision;
(b)
a continuous period of 6 months, or any longer period provided in the
contract, during which the group life insured was not disabled.
(3)
An insurer that is liable under subsection (1) to pay insurance money
or provide a benefit as a result of the disability of a group life
insured is not liable to pay the insurance money or provide the
benefit for any period longer than the portion remaining, at the date
the disability began, of the maximum period provided under the
contract for the payment of insurance money or the provision of a
benefit in respect of a disability of the group life insured.
(4)
If a contract of group insurance, in this subsection called the
"replacement contract", is entered into within 31 days after the
termination of another contract of group insurance, in this subsection
called the "other contract", and that replacement contract insures
some or all of the same group life insureds as the other contract,
(a)
the replacement contract is deemed to provide that any person who was
insured under the other contract at the time of its termination is
insured under the replacement contract from and after the termination
of the other contract if
(i)
the insurance on that person under the other contract terminated by
reason only of the termination of the other contract, and
(ii)
the person is a member of a class eligible for insurance under the
replacement contract, and
(b)
no person who was insured under the other contract at the time of its
termination may be excluded from eligibility under the replacement
contract by reason only of not being actively at work on the effective
date of the replacement contract,
and, despite subsection (1), if the replacement contract provides that
insurance money or other benefits to be paid or provided under
subsection (1) by the insurer of the other contract are to be paid
instead under the replacement contract, the insurer of the other
contract is not liable to pay that insurance money or provide those
benefits.
Designation of beneficiary
59
(1)
Subject to subsection (4), an insured may in a contract or by a
declaration designate the insured, the insured's personal
representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for whose
benefit insurance money is to be payable.
(2)
Subject to section 60, the insured may alter or revoke the designation
by a declaration.
(3)
A designation in favour of the "heirs", "next of kin" or "estate" of
an insured, or the use of words having similar meaning in a
designation, is deemed to be a designation of the personal
representative of the insured.
(4)
Subject to the regulations, an insurer may restrict or exclude in a
contract the right of an insured to designate persons to whom or for
whose benefit insurance money is to be payable.
(5)
A contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group
insurance on some or all of the group life insureds under the replaced
contract may provide that a designation applicable to the replaced
contract of a group life insured, a group life insured's personal
representative or a beneficiary as a person to whom or for whose
benefit insurance money is to be payable is deemed to apply to the
replacing contract.
(6)
If a contract of group insurance replacing another contract of group
insurance provides that a designation referred to in subsection (5) is
deemed to apply to the replacing contract,
(a)
each certificate in respect of the replacing contract must indicate
that the designation under the replaced contract has been carried
forward and that the group life insured should review the existing
designation to ensure it reflects the group life insured's current
intentions, and
(b)
as between the insurer under the replacing contract and a claimant
under that contract, that insurer is liable to the claimant for any
errors or omissions by the previous insurer in respect of the
recording of the designation carried forward under the replacing
contract.
(7)
If a beneficiary becomes entitled to insurance money and all or part
of the insurance money remains with the insurer under a settlement
option provided for in the contract or permitted by the insurer, that
portion of the insurance money remaining with the insurer is deemed to
be insurance money held under a contract on the life of the
beneficiary, and, subject to the provisions of the settlement option,
the beneficiary has the rights and interests of an insured with
respect to the insurance money.
Irrevocable designation of beneficiary
60
(1)
An insured may in a contract or by a declaration, other than a
declaration that is part of a will, filed with the insurer at its head
or principal office in Canada during the lifetime of the person whose
life is insured, designate a beneficiary irrevocably, and in that
event the insured, while the beneficiary is living, may not alter or
revoke the designation without the consent of the beneficiary, and the
insurance money is not subject to the control of the insured or the
claims of the insured's creditors and does not form part of the
insured's estate.
(2)
If the insured purports to designate a beneficiary irrevocably in a
will or in a declaration that is not filed as provided in subsection
(1), the designation has the same effect as if the insured had not
purported to make it irrevocable.
Designation in will
61
(1)
A designation in an instrument purporting to be a will is not
ineffective by reason only of the fact that the instrument is invalid
as a will, or that the designation is invalid as a bequest under the
will.
(2)
Despite the
Wills, Estates and Succession Act
, a designation in a will is of no effect against a designation made
later than the making of the will.
(3)
If a designation is contained in a will and subsequently the will is
revoked by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.
(4)
If a designation is contained in an instrument that purports to be a
will and the instrument, if it were valid as a will, would be revoked
by operation of law or otherwise, the designation is revoked.
Trustee for beneficiary
62
(1)
An insured may in a contract or by a declaration appoint a trustee for
a beneficiary and may alter or revoke the appointment by a
declaration.
(2)
A payment made by an insurer to the trustee for a beneficiary
discharges the insurer to the extent of the payment.
Predeceased or disclaiming beneficiary
63
(1)
If a beneficiary predeceases the person whose life is insured, and no
disposition of the share of the deceased beneficiary in the insurance
money is provided for in the contract or by a declaration, the share
is payable
(a)
to the surviving beneficiary,
(b)
if there is more than one surviving beneficiary, to the surviving
beneficiaries in equal shares, or
(c)
if there is no surviving beneficiary, to the insured or the insured's
personal representative.
(2)
If 2 or more beneficiaries are designated otherwise than
alternatively, but no division of the insurance money is made, the
insurance money is payable to them in equal shares.
(3)
A beneficiary may disclaim the beneficiary's right to insurance money
by filing notice in writing with the insurer at its head or principal
office in Canada.
(4)
A notice of disclaimer filed under subsection (3) is irrevocable.
(5)
Subsection (1) applies in the case of a disclaiming beneficiary or in
the case of a beneficiary determined by a court to be disentitled to
insurance money as if the disclaiming or disentitled beneficiary
predeceased the person whose life is insured.
Enforcement of payment by beneficiary or trustee
64
A beneficiary may enforce in the beneficiary's own name and for the
beneficiary's own benefit, and a trustee appointed under
section 62 may enforce as trustee, the payment of insurance money
made payable to the beneficiary or trustee in the contract or by a
declaration and in accordance with the provisions of it, but the
insurer may set up any defence that it could have set up against the
insured or the insured's personal representative.
Insurance money exempt from seizure
65
(1)
If a beneficiary is designated, the insurance money, from the time of
the happening of the event on which the insurance money becomes
payable, is not part of the estate of the insured and is not subject
to the claims of the creditors of the insured.
(2)
While there is in effect a designation in favour of any one or more of
a spouse, child, grandchild or parent of a person whose life is
insured, the insurance money and the rights and interests of the
insured in the insurance money and in the contract are exempt from
execution or seizure.
Assignment of insurance
66
(1)
If a beneficiary
(a)
is not designated irrevocably, or
(b)
is designated irrevocably but has attained the age of 19 years
and consents,
the insured may assign, exercise rights under or in respect of,
surrender or otherwise deal with the contract as provided in it or in
this Part, or as may be agreed on with the insurer.
(2)
Despite section 60 (1), if a beneficiary is designated irrevocably and
has not consented as described in subsection (l) (b) of this section,
the insured may exercise any rights in respect of the contract that
are prescribed by regulation.
(3)
Subject to the terms of a consent under subsection (l) (b) or a court
order under subsection (4), if there is an irrevocable designation of
a beneficiary under a contract, a person acquiring an interest in the
contract takes that interest subject to the rights of that
beneficiary.
(4)
When a beneficiary who is designated irrevocably is unable to provide
consent under subsection (1) (b) because of legal incapacity, an
insured may apply to the court for an order permitting the insured to
deal with the contract without that consent.
(5)
The court may grant an order under subsection (4) on any notice and
terms it considers just.
Entitlement to dividends
67
(1)
Despite the irrevocable designation of a beneficiary, the insured is
entitled before the insured's death to the dividends or bonuses
declared on a contract, unless the contract provides otherwise.
(2)
Unless the insured directs otherwise, the insurer may apply the
dividends or bonuses declared on the contract for the purpose of
keeping the contract in force.
Transfer of insured's rights
68
(1)
Despite the
Wills, Estates and Succession Act
, if, in a contract or declaration, it is provided that a person named
in the contract or declaration has, on the death of the insured, the
rights and interests of the insured in the contract,
(a)
the rights and interests of the insured in the contract do not, on the
death of the insured, form part of the insured's estate, and
(b)
on the death of the insured, the person named in the contract or
declaration has the rights and interests given to the insured by the
contract and by this Part and is deemed to be the insured.
(2)
If the contract or declaration provides that 2 or more persons named
in the contract or in the declaration, on the death of the insured,
have successively on the death of each of them the rights and
interests of the insured in the contract, this section applies
successively, so far as applicable and with the necessary changes, to
each of those persons and their rights and interests in the contract.
(3)
Despite a nomination made under this section, the insured may, before
the insured's death,
(a)
assign, exercise rights under or in respect of, surrender or otherwise
deal with the contract as if the nomination had not been made, and
(b)
subject to the terms of the contract, alter or revoke the nomination
by declaration.
Effect of assignment
69
(1)
If an assignee of a contract gives notice in writing of the assignment
to the insurer at its head or principal office in Canada, the assignee
has priority of interest as against
(a)
an assignee other than one who gave notice earlier to the insurer of
an assignment in the manner provided for in this subsection, and
(b)
a beneficiary other than one designated irrevocably as provided for in
section 60 before the assignee gave notice to the insurer of the
assignment in the manner provided for in this subsection.
(2)
If a contract is assigned as security, the rights of a beneficiary
under the contract are affected only to the extent necessary to give
effect to the rights and interests of the assignee.
(3)
If a contract is assigned unconditionally and otherwise than as
security, the assignee has all the rights and interests given to the
insured by the contract and by this Part and is deemed to be the
insured.
(4)
Unless the document by which a contract is assigned specifies
otherwise, an assignment described in subsection (3) made on or after
the date this section comes into force revokes
(a)
a designation of a beneficiary made before or after that date and not
made irrevocably, and
(b)
a nomination referred to in section 68 (1) made before or after that
date.
(5)
A contract may provide that the rights or interests of the insured or,
in the case of a contract of group insurance or creditor's group
insurance, of the group life insured or debtor insured, as applicable,
are not assignable.
Group life insured may enforce rights
70
A group life insured may in their own name enforce a right given to
the group life insured under a contract, subject to any defence
available to the insurer against the group life insured or against the
insured.
Debtor insured may enforce rights
71
(1)
A debtor insured, or a debtor who is jointly liable for the debt with
the debtor insured, may enforce
(a)
in the case of the debtor insured, in the debtor insured's own name,

in the case of the jointly liable debtor, in the jointly liable
debtor's own name,
the creditor's rights in respect of a claim arising in relation to
that debtor insured, subject to any defence available to the insurer
against the creditor or that debtor insured.
(2)
Subject to subsection (3), if an insurer pays insurance money in
respect of a claim under subsection (1), the insurer must pay the
insurance money to the creditor.

If the debtor insured provides evidence satisfactory to the insurer
that the insurance money exceeds the debt then owing to the creditor,
the insurer may pay the excess directly to that debtor insured.
Capacity of minors

has reached the age of 16 years has the capacity of a person of
the age of 19 years

in respect of a contract.

the name and age of the beneficiary, if there is a beneficiary,

insurance money to the person entitled to it.
Payment of insurance money
74
(1)
Subject to subsections (3) to (5), insurance money is payable in
British Columbia.
(2)
Unless a contract otherwise provides, a reference in it to dollars
means Canadian dollars, whether the contract by its terms provides for
payment in Canada or elsewhere.
(3)
If a person entitled to receive insurance money is not resident in
British Columbia, the insurer may pay the insurance money to that
person or to any other person who is entitled to receive it on the
person's behalf by the law of the jurisdiction in which the payee
resides, and the payment discharges the insurer to the extent of the
amount paid.
(4)
In the case of a contract of group insurance, insurance money is
payable in the province or territory of Canada in which the group life
insured was resident at the time the group life insured became
insured.
(5)
If insurance money is payable under a contract to a deceased person
who was not resident in British Columbia at the date of their death or
to that person's personal representative, the insurer may pay the
insurance money to the deceased person's personal representative as
appointed under the law of the jurisdiction in which the person was
resident at the date of their death, and the payment discharges the
insurer to the extent of the amount paid.
Action in British Columbia
75
Regardless of the place where a contract was made, a claimant who is
resident in British Columbia may bring an action in British Columbia
if the insurer was authorized to transact insurance in British
Columbia at the time the contract was made or is so authorized at the
time the action is brought.
Limitation of actions
76
(1)
Subject to subsections (2) and (5), an action or proceeding against an

knew or ought to have known of the first instance of the loss or
occurrence giving rise to the claim for insurance money.
(4)
If insurance money is not payable unless a loss or occurrence
continues for a period of time specified in the contract, the date of
the first instance of the loss or occurrence for the purposes of
subsection (3) is deemed to be the first day after the end of that
period.
(5)
An action or proceeding against an insurer for the recovery of
insurance money payable on a periodic basis must be commenced not
later than the later of
(a)
the last day of the applicable period under subsection (1), (2), (3)

if insurance money was paid, 2 years after the date the next payment
would have been payable had the insurer continued to make periodic
payments.

Until an insurer receives at its head or principal office in Canada an
instrument or an order of a court affecting the right to receive
insurance money, or a notarial copy, or a copy verified by statutory
declaration, of the instrument or order, it may make payment of the
insurance money and is discharged to the extent of the amount paid as
if there were no instrument or order.
(2)
Subsection (1) does not affect the rights or interests of any person
other than the insurer.
Declaration as to sufficiency of proof
78
If an insurer admits the validity of the insurance but does not admit
the sufficiency of the evidence required by section 73 and there
is no other question in issue except a question under section 3
of the
Presumption of Death Act
, the insurer or the claimant may, before or after action is brought
and on at least 30 days' notice, apply to the court for a
declaration as to the sufficiency of the evidence furnished, and the
court may make the declaration or may direct what further evidence
must be furnished, and on it being furnished may make the declaration

On making a declaration under section 78 or an order under the
Presumption of Death Act
, the court may make an order respecting the payment of the insurance
money and respecting costs it considers just, and a declaration or
direction or order made under this subsection is binding on the
applicant and on all persons to whom notice of the application has
been given.
(2)
A payment made under an order under subsection (1) discharges the
insurer to the extent of the amount paid.
Application to court operates as stay of proceedings
80
Unless the court otherwise orders, an application made under
section 78 or section 3 of the
Presumption of Death Act
operates as a stay of any pending action with respect to the insurance
money.
Powers of court
81
If the court finds that the evidence furnished under section 73
is not sufficient or that a presumption of death is not established
under the
Presumption of Death Act
, it may order that the matters in issue be decided in an action

just respecting further evidence to be furnished by the claimant,
publication of advertisements, further inquiry or any other matter or
respecting costs.

discharge who is willing to do so,
(c)
the insurance money has become unclaimed property under the
Unclaimed Property Act

insurer to the extent of the payment.
Simultaneous deaths
83
Unless a contract or a declaration provides otherwise, if the person
whose life is insured and a beneficiary die at the same time or in

instalments and a contract, or an instrument signed by the insured and
delivered to the insurer, provides that a beneficiary does not have
the right to commute the instalments or to alienate or assign the
beneficiary's interest in the instalments, the insurer must not,
unless the insured subsequently directs otherwise in writing, commute
the instalments or pay them to any person other than the beneficiary,

any legal process, except an action to recover the value of
necessaries supplied to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's minor
children.
