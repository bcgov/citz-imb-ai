Part 5 — Accident Fund and Employer Assessment
Division 1 — Accident Fund and Assessments for Purposes of Fund
Accident fund
239
(1)
The Board must continue and maintain the accident fund
(a)
for payment of compensation, outlays and expenses under the
compensation provisions,
(b)
for payment of expenses incurred in the Board's administration of this
Act, and
(c)
for payment to the government required under section 284 (2)
[appeal tribunal expenses]
or 350 (4)
[workers' advisers and employers' advisers expenses]
.
(2)
The Board is solely responsible for the management of the accident
fund and must manage it with a view to the best interests of the
workers' compensation system.
Board estimate of amounts needed for accident fund
240
(1)
For the purpose of assessment under section 241, the Board must every
year make an estimate of sufficient funds to do the following:
(a)
meet all amounts payable from the accident fund during the year;
(b)
provide a reserve in aid of industries or classes which may become
depleted or extinguished;
(c)
provide a reserve to be used to meet the loss arising from a disaster
or other circumstance that the Board considers would unfairly burden
the employers in a class;
(d)
provide and maintain a reserve for payment of that portion of the
disability enhanced by reason of a pre-existing disease, condition or
disability;
(e)
provide in each year capitalized reserves sufficient to meet the
periodic payments of compensation accruing in future years in respect
of all injuries which occur during the year;
(f)
provide and maintain a reserve for payment of retirement benefits.
(2)
If it is found, on an estimate made by the Board, that more than
sufficient funds have been provided for the purposes set out in
subsection (1) (a) to (d), the excess may be transferred to the
capitalized reserves of the fund.
Annual employer assessments for accident fund purposes
241
(1)
For the purpose of continuing and maintaining an adequate accident
fund, the Board must every year assess and levy on and collect from
employers and independent operators in each class established under
section 244
[classification of industries]
sufficient funds as estimated for the year under section 240.
(2)
An assessment under this section must be rated on payroll, rated on a
unit of production or made in another manner the Board considers
proper.
Additional assessment amounts
242
(1)
If the Board considers that there are not sufficient funds to provide
the compensation required to be paid under the compensation
provisions,
(a)
the Board may levy on and collect from employers within the scope of
the compensation provisions sufficient funds for this purpose without
regard to the date of injury or the period during which the employer
carried on an industry within the scope of those provisions,
(b)
the levy and collection may be by way of addition to the usual
assessment or by levy of special or additional assessment, and
(c)
the levy and collection may be made in the manner and at the times the
Board considers equitable.
(2)
If the estimated assessments in a class prove insufficient, the Board
(a)
may make further assessments and levies as necessary, or
(b)
may temporarily advance the amount of a deficiency out of any reserve
provided for that purpose and add that amount to any subsequent
assessments.
(3)
The following apply if special circumstances, including legislative
change, result in claims being made or liabilities being imposed on
the accident fund in excess of what the Board considers should
reasonably be funded by assessments levied during the current year:
(a)
the Board must raise sufficient funds by assessments during that year
to meet the estimated payments due within the year;
(b)
the Board need not establish within the year reserves to meet future
payments on those claims or liabilities and may instead establish
those reserves by assessments levied over a period of years.
General rules in relation to assessments
243
(1)
Assessments
(a)
may be made in the manner and form and by the procedure the Board
considers adequate and expedient, and
(b)
may be general as applicable to a class or subclass, or special as
applicable to an industry or part or department of an industry.
(2)
If the Board considers this to be expedient, assessments may be
collected in half-yearly, quarterly or monthly instalments, or
otherwise.
(3)
If the Board considers that the funds in a class are sufficient for
the time being, an instalment may be reduced or cancelled or its
collection deferred.

of each of the employer's industries within the scope of the

provisions, and

assessment and levy based on that estimate, in which case the employer
is bound by the estimate, assessment and levy.
(3)
If an employer fails to comply with subsection (1), or if a statement
made under the requirements of that subsection is not true and
accurate, the employer commits an offence for every such failure to
comply and for every such statement.
Use of payroll information for purpose of assessment
246
(1)
In computing the amount of the payroll for the purpose of assessment,
regard must be had only to that portion of the payroll that represents
workers and employment within the scope of the compensation
provisions.

If a worker's wages are greater than the maximum wage rate for the
year as determined under section 209, a deduction may be made where
practical in respect of the portion in excess of that rate.

rate referred to in subsection (2), the Board may make a deduction

amount of the worker's average earnings for purposes of the

The Board must establish subclassifications, differentials and
proportions in the rates as between the different kinds of employment
in the same class, as the Board considers just.
(2)
If the Board considers that a particular industry or plant is
circumstanced or conducted such that the hazard or cost of
compensation differs from the average of the class or subclass to
which the industry or plant is assigned, the Board
(a)
must establish a special rate, differential or assessment for that
industry or plant to correspond with the relative hazard or cost of
compensation of the industry or plant, and
(b)
for the purpose referred to in paragraph (a), may also adopt a system
of experience rating.
(3)
The Board may, in a manner that the Board determines,
(a)
vary the rates of assessment as between different employers, or
(b)
levy supplementary assessments
according to the estimated exposure of workers to industrial noise.
(4)
The Board may make that variance or levy under subsection (3) whether
or not hearing protection is worn.
Class accounts for accident fund
248

Separate accounts must be maintained of the amounts collected and
expended in respect of every class, reserve and special fund, but the
accident fund is, for the purpose of paying compensation, one fund and
indivisible.
(2)

(a)
may charge to that class or subclass interest on the amount of the
deficit at a rate that will reimburse the accident fund for any loss

serious breach of duty of care of
(i)

that is in a different class or subclass from that of the worker's
employer.

of which compensation under Part 4
