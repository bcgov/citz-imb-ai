(b)
the burden of disproving the fact lies on the other party.

A party need not plead the performance of a condition precedent
necessary for the party's case unless the other party has specifically
denied it in the other party's pleadings.
Matters arising since start of proceeding
(5)
A party may plead a matter that has arisen since the start of the
proceeding.
Inconsistent allegations
(6)
A party must not plead an allegation of fact or a new ground or claim

(9)
Conclusions of law must not be pleaded unless the material facts

of a party is specifically denied, it is deemed to be admitted.
Set-off or counterclaim
(11)
A defendant in an action may set off or set up by way of counterclaim
any right or claim, whether the set-off or counterclaim is for damages
or not, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final judgment on all
claims in the same action.
Pleading after the notice of civil claim
(12)
In a pleading subsequent to a notice of civil claim, a party must
plead specifically any matter of fact or point of law that
(a)

or
(c)
raises issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleading.

pleading of the opposite party, the party must not do so evasively but
must answer the point of substance.
Denial of contract
(16)
If a contract, promise or agreement is alleged in a pleading, a bare
denial of it by the opposite party is to be construed only as a denial
of fact of the express contract, promise or agreement alleged, or of
the matters of fact from which it may be implied by law, and not as a
denial of the legality or sufficiency in law of that contract, promise
or agreement.
Allegation of malice
(17)
It is sufficient to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge or
other condition of the mind of a person as a fact, without setting out
the circumstances from which it is to be inferred.
Particulars
When particulars necessary
(18)
If the party pleading relies on misrepresentation, fraud, breach of
trust, wilful default or undue influence, or if particulars may be
necessary, full particulars, with dates and items if applicable, must
be stated in the pleading.
Lengthy particulars
(19)
If the particulars required under subrule (18) of debt, expenses or
damages are lengthy, the party pleading may refer to this fact and,
instead of pleading the particulars, must serve the particulars in a
separate document either before or with the pleading.
Further particulars
(20)
Particulars need only be pleaded to the extent that they are known at
the date of pleading, but further particulars
(a)
may be served after they become known, and

must be served within 10 days after a demand is made in writing.

plaintiff must give particulars of the facts and matters on which the
plaintiff relies in support of that sense, and
(b)
if the defendant alleges that, insofar as the words complained of
consist of statements of fact, they are true in substance and in fact,
and that insofar as they consist of expressions of opinion, they are
fair comment on a matter of public interest, the defendant must give
particulars stating which of the words complained of the defendant
alleges are statements of fact and of the facts and matters relied on
in support of the allegation that the words are true.
Order for particulars
(22)
The court may order a party to serve further and better particulars of
a matter stated in a pleading.
Demand for particulars
(23)
Before applying to the court for particulars, a party must demand them
in writing from the other party.
Demand for particulars not a stay of proceedings
(24)
A demand for particulars does not operate as a stay of proceedings or
give an extension of time, but a party may apply for an extension of
time for serving a responding pleading on the ground that the party
cannot answer the originating pleading until particulars are provided.

Rule 9-8 — Discontinuance and Withdrawal
Discontinuance before action set for trial
(1)
At any time before a notice of trial is filed in an action, a
plaintiff may discontinue it in whole or in part against a defendant
by filing a notice of discontinuance in Form 36 and serving a filed
copy of the notice of discontinuance on all parties of record.
Discontinuance after action set for trial
(2)
After a notice of trial is filed in an action, a plaintiff may
discontinue the action in whole or in part against a defendant with
the consent of all parties of record or by leave of the court.
Withdrawal by defendant
(3)
A defendant may withdraw his or her response to civil claim or any
part of it with respect to any plaintiff at any time by filing a
notice of withdrawal in Form 37 and serving a filed copy of the notice
of withdrawal on all parties of record.
Costs and default procedure on discontinuance or withdrawal
(4)
Subject to subrule (2), a person wholly discontinuing an action
against a party or wholly withdrawing his or her response to civil
claim filed in response to a notice of civil claim of a party must pay
the costs of that party to the date of service of the notice of
discontinuance or the notice of withdrawal, as the case may be, and if
a plaintiff who is liable for costs under this subrule subsequently
brings a proceeding for the same or substantially the same claim
before paying those costs, the court may order the proceeding to be
stayed until the costs are paid.
Third party entitled to costs
(5)
If a plaintiff discontinues the whole or any part of an action in
which a person has been joined as a third party, the third party, if
the discontinuance disposes of the claim against the third party, is
entitled to costs and may apply to the court for a direction as to who
should pay them.
Some costs remain recoverable
(6)
A plaintiff's right to recover costs from a defendant under subrule
(4) does not preclude the plaintiff recovering other costs properly
incurred.
Proceeding after response is withdrawn
(7)
If a defendant wholly or partly withdraws his or her response under
this rule, the plaintiff may proceed under Rule 3-8 as if the
defendant had served no response or only a partial response.
Discontinuance not a defence
(8)
Unless the court otherwise orders, the discontinuance of an action in
whole or in part is not a defence to a subsequent proceeding for the
same or substantially the same cause of action.
Application to counterclaim, third party proceeding and petition.
(9)
This rule applies to a counterclaim, a third party proceeding and a
petition.
