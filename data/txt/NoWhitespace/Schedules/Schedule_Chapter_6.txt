Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement
CHAPTER 6
LAND MANAGEMENT
POWER TO MAKE LAWS
1. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of:
a. the creation, ownership and Disposition of a Tsawwassen Fee Simple
Interest;
b. the ownership and Disposition of estates or interests in Tsawwassen
Lands including:
i. fee simple interests;
ii. mortgages;
iii. leases;
iv. licences, permits, easements and rights of way, including rights of
way and covenants similar to those in sections 218 and 219 of the
Land Title Act
; and
v. any conditions or restrictions on such estates or interests.
c. the ownership and Disposition of rights of access to any Tsawwassen
Lands to certain Tsawwassen Members for cultural purposes, including
gathering, and the recording of such rights of access by Tsawwassen
First Nation in accordance with arrangements made by Tsawwassen First
Nation with interest holders on Tsawwassen Lands;
d. the management and use of Tsawwassen Lands, including planning,
zoning and development;
e. the establishment and operation of a Tsawwassen First Nation land
title or land registry system:
i. for Tsawwassen Lands that are not registered in the Land Title
Office; or
ii. for interests that are not recognized under Federal or Provincial
Law;
f. provision of services in relation to Tsawwassen Lands;
g. expropriation for public purposes or public works by Tsawwassen First
Nation of estates or interests in Tsawwassen Lands, if Tsawwassen First
Nation provides fair compensation to the owner of the estate or
interest; and
h. the approval of proposed developments on Tsawwassen Lands.
2. Despite subclause 1.g, Tsawwassen First Nation may not expropriate:
a. estates or interests granted or continued on the Effective Date where
expropriation is precluded under the terms and conditions of those
estates or interests;
b. estates or interests expropriated by Canada or British Columbia after
the Effective Date; or
c. estates or interests granted or continued on the Effective Date to a
provincial ministry or agent of the provincial Crown or for the use of a
Public Utility, whether or not an agent of the Crown, that would
otherwise have authority to expropriate an estate or interest in land
under provincial legislation or on whose behalf British Columbia may
expropriate.
3. For greater certainty, subclause 2.c describes an exception to the
Tsawwassen Government law making authority in respect of expropriation
and does not and is not intended to address the authority of a
Provincial Expropriating Authority to expropriate under provincial
legislation which authority is dealt with in the Lands chapter.
4. Tsawwassen Government may exercise authority over agriculture on
Tsawwassen Lands through land use planning and zoning under subclause
1.d.
5. A Tsawwassen Law made under clause 1 prevails to the extent of a
Conflict with a Federal or Provincial Law.
6. Despite clause 5, a Federal or Provincial Law in respect of the
division of matrimonial real property prevails to the extent of a
Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of matrimonial
real property made under subclause 1.a or 1.b. For greater certainty, a
Tsawwassen Law that may restrict the Disposition of real property to a
Tsawwassen Member is not a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of
matrimonial real property.
7. Despite clause 5, except in respect of the Former Tsawwassen Reserve
and any other Tsawwassen Lands excluded from an agricultural land
reserve designation, the
Agricultural Land Commission Act
prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law made under
subclause 1.d.
8. Despite clause 5, a Federal or Provincial Law in relation to
Environmental Assessment prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a
Tsawwassen Law made under subclause 1.h.
9. A Tsawwassen Law under subclause 1.a or 1.b in respect of estates or
interests that are recognized under Federal or Provincial Law must be
consistent with common law principles in respect of those interests and,
for greater certainty, a Tsawwassen Law in respect of a Tsawwassen Fee
Simple Interest is not inconsistent with common law principles.
10. Without limiting the scope of authority of Tsawwassen Government to
make laws under this Agreement, before Tsawwassen Government makes a law
under subclause 1.d, Tsawwassen First Nation will consult residents of
Tsawwassen Lands who may be affected by the proposed law, through a
process similar in principle to that required of a municipality
undertaking similar law-making.
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
11. Despite any approval of a proposed development made by Tsawwassen
First Nation under subclause 1.h, no Federal Project or Provincial
Project on Tsawwassen Lands will proceed unless there has been
compliance with any applicable Federal or Provincial Law in respect of
Environmental Assessment.
12. For greater certainty, Tsawwassen First Nation may establish
administrative procedures for evaluating proposed developments referred
to in subclause 1.h, including the environmental effects of the
developments.
PROVINCIAL INITIATIVES AND LAND USE PROCESSES
13. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
participating in processes or institutions, including processes or
institutions that may address matters of shared decision-making, or
benefiting from future provincial programs, policies or initiatives of
general application to First Nations as British Columbia develops a new
relationship with First Nations.
14. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
participating in, or benefiting from, federal or provincial
benefit-sharing programs of general application, in accordance with
general criteria established for those programs from time to time.
15. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
entering into arrangements that are consistent with this Agreement, with
willing third parties, in order to further economic opportunities for
Tsawwassen First Nation.
16. British Columbia will invite Tsawwassen First Nation to participate
in any provincial land use planning process affecting Tsawwassen
Territory on the following bases:
a. Tsawwassen First Nation will be consulted and may participate in the
same capacity as a Local Government, a First Nation or as a member of
the public, as the case may be; and
b. British Columbia will provide Tsawwassen First Nation with the
decision resulting from any such process and the reasons for that
decision.
