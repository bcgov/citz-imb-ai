means the use of a lock or locks to render machinery or equipment inoperable or to isolate an energy source in accordance with a written procedure;



"maintenance"

means work performed to keep machinery or equipment in a safe operating condition, including installing, repairing, cleaning, lubricating and the clearing of obstructions to the normal flow of material;



"normal production"

means work that is routine, repetitive, and integral to the normal use of machinery or equipment for production;

means a lock provided by the employer for use by a worker to ensure personal lockout protection such that each lock when applied is operable only by a key in the worker's possession, and by a key under the control of the supervisor or manager in charge.








General requirement





10.2



If the unexpected energization or startup of machinery or equipment or the unexpected release of an energy source could cause injury, the energy source must be isolated and effectively controlled.








When lockout required





10.3



(1)


If machinery or equipment is shut down for maintenance, no work may be done until






(a)


all parts and attachments have been secured against inadvertent movement,






(b)


where the work will expose workers to energy sources, the hazard has been effectively controlled, and






(c)


the energy isolating devices have been locked out as required by this Part.






(2)


If machinery or equipment is in use for normal production work, subsection (1) applies if a work activity creates a risk of injury to workers from the movement of the machinery or equipment, or exposure to an energy source, and the machinery or equipment is not effectively safeguarded to protect the workers from the risk.








Lockout procedures





10.4



(1)


When lockout of energy isolating devices is required, the devices must be secured in the safe position using locks in accordance with procedures that are made available to all workers who are required to work on the machinery or equipment.






(2)


The employer must ensure that each worker required to lock out has ready access to sufficient personal locks to implement the required lockout procedure.






(3)


Combination locks must not be used for lockout.






(4)


Each personal lock must be marked or tagged to identify the person applying it.






(5)


Procedures must be implemented for shift or personnel changes, including the orderly transfer of control of locked out energy isolating devices between outgoing and incoming workers.






(6)


If the use of a personal lock is not practicable for lockout, another effective means, if approved by the Board, may be used in place of a personal lock to secure an energy isolating device in the safe position.








Access to energy isolating devices





10.5



When an energy isolating device is locked out, the lock must not prevent access to other energy isolating devices supplying machinery or equipment that could cause injury to workers.








Checking locked out equipment





10.6

(1)


If a large number of workers are working on machinery or equipment or a large number of energy isolating devices must be locked out, a group lockout procedure that meets the requirements of subsections (2) to (7) may be used.






(2)


In a group lockout procedure 2 qualified workers must be responsible for






(a)


independently locking out the energy isolating devices,






(b)


securing the keys for the locks used under paragraph (a) with personal locks or other positive sealing devices acceptable to the Board, and






(c)


completing, signing and posting a checklist that identifies the machinery or equipment components covered by the lockout.






(3)

Workers may lock out a secondary key securing system if 2 qualified workers lock out the primary key securing system and place their keys in the secondary system.






(5)


On completion of the worker's work, each worker referred to in subsections (3) and (4) must remove the worker's personal lock from the key securing system.






(6)


When the requirements of subsection (5) have been met and it has been determined that it is safe to end the group lockout, 2 qualified workers must be responsible for removing their personal locks or the positive sealing device(s) from the key securing system or systems containing the keys for the locks used under subsection (2) (a), and once those keys are released, the system is no longer considered to be locked out.
