(1)


An administrator is not required to take any action under this Part until the administrator has sufficient information to identify the plan.

if delay may avoid or reduce transaction costs associated with dividing benefits, or

Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act


, in the case of a plan to which that Act applies, and
