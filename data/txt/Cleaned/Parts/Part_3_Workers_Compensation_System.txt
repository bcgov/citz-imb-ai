any other cause of action, whether that duty or cause of action is
imposed by or arises by reason of law or contract, express or implied,
to which a worker or a dependant or family member of the worker is or
may be entitled against




(i)

the employer of the worker,




(ii)

an employer within the scope of the compensation provisions, or




(iii)

any other worker,


in respect of any personal injury, disablement or death of the worker
arising out of and in the course of employment, and




(b)

no action lies in respect of such an injury, disablement or death.




(2)

Subsection (1) applies only if the action or conduct of




(a)

the employer or the employer's servant or agent, or




(b)

the other worker,


that caused the breach of duty of care arose out of and in the course
of employment within the scope of the compensation provisions.

approval of the Board, less is recovered and collected than the amount
of the compensation to which a worker or dependant would be entitled

to compensation under those provisions to the extent of the amount of
the difference.






Board has right of action if compensation is claimed

would be entitled under the compensation provisions, the amount of the
excess, less costs and administration charges, must be paid by the
Board to the worker or dependant.

worker




131


The following apply if, in an action brought by a worker, by a

(b)

an independent operator to whom the compensation provisions apply by
Board direction under section 4 (2) (a)
[Board direction of application]
.




(2)
