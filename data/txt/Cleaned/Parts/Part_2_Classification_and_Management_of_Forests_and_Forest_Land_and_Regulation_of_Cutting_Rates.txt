The Lieutenant Governor in Council may designate any forest land as a Provincial forest and may order that Provincial forests be consolidated or divided.






(2)


Notice of an order made under subsection (1) must be published in the Gazette.

Crown land in a Provincial forest must not be disposed of under the


Taxation (Rural Area) Act

an easement or right of way, or






(b)


any other purpose that the chief forester considers is compatible with the uses described in section 2 (1) of the


Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act


or that is permitted by regulations made under that Act,


but, except for the purposes of a highway, transmission line, or pipeline right of way, a disposition must not be made of the fee simple interest in the land.






(6)


If the Lieutenant Governor in Council considers it will be to the social and economic benefit of British Columbia, he or she may cancel a Provincial forest, except for land in a tree farm licence area.

If the minister considers it will be to the social and economic benefit of British Columbia, he or she may delete land from a Provincial forest, except for land in a tree farm licence area.

Land that is deleted from a Provincial forest and is granted by the government, but later reverts to the government, is deemed to be included in the Provincial forest without further order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.








Wilderness areas

the Crown land in each timber supply area, excluding the Crown land in the licence areas of area-based licences, and






(b)


each tree farm licence area.






(2)


If the minister

makes an order under section 7 (b) respecting a timber supply area, or






(b)


amends or enters into a tree farm licence to accomplish a result set out under section 39 (2) or (3),


the chief forester must make an allowable annual cut determination under subsection (1) for the timber supply area or tree farm licence area

If, in respect of the allowable annual cut for a timber supply area or tree farm licence area, the chief forester considers that the allowable annual cut that was determined under subsection (1) is not likely to be changed significantly with a new determination, then, despite subsections (1) to (3), the chief forester






(a)


by written order may postpone the next determination under subsection (1) to a date that is up to 15 years after the date of the relevant last determination, and






(b)


must give written reasons for the postponement.






(3.2)

by written order may rescind the order made under subsection (3.1) and set an earlier date for the next determination under subsection (1), and






(b)


must give written reasons for setting the earlier date.

(i)


if the minister makes an order under section 7 (b) respecting the timber supply area, or

(b)


for a tree farm licence area






(i)


if the minister replaces or amends the tree farm licence under section 39 (2) or (3), subject to section 39 (6),

Plans, studies, analyses and information

If the chief forester determines that the holder of a tree farm licence has failed to comply with subsection (2), the allowable annual cut for the tree farm licence area in effect at the time of the determination is reduced by 25% effective January 1 of the year following the year in which the determination is made.






(4)


If, on the first anniversary of a determination under subsection (3), the chief forester determines that the holder of the tree farm licence has not yet complied with subsection (2), the allowable annual cut in effect immediately before that determination is reduced by 25% effective January 1 of the year following the year in which that determination is made.
