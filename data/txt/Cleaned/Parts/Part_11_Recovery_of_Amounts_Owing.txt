(5)


If under this section the director demands that a person pay to the government, on account of a taxpayer's liability under this Act, money otherwise payable by that person to the taxpayer as interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic payment, the demand






(a)


is applicable to all of those payments to be made by the person to the taxpayer until the liability under this Act is satisfied, and






(b)

(6)


Money or a beneficial interest in money in a savings institution






(a)


on deposit to the credit of a taxpayer at the time a demand is given, or






(b)


deposited to the credit of a taxpayer after a demand is given

(a)


if the person is indebted or liable to make a payment to the taxpayer at the time the demand is given, as soon as the demand is given to the person;






(b)


in any other case, as soon as the person becomes indebted or liable to make a payment to the taxpayer.

(11)


A person who fails to comply with a demand under subsection (3) is liable to pay to the government an amount equal to the lesser of
