in any other case, unless it appears to the court that the present shareholders are unable to satisfy the contributions required to be made by them.






(3)


For the purposes of this section, any dividend, profit or other amount that is due to a shareholder as a result of that person being a shareholder may be taken into account for the purpose of the final adjustment of the rights of the shareholders among themselves, but that sum ranks behind a debt owed to a person that is not due to that person by reason of that person being a shareholder.

Division 9 — Debentures







Validity of perpetual debenture





102



Despite any rule of equity to the contrary, no condition contained in a debenture, or in a deed for securing a debenture, is invalid merely because the debenture is made irredeemable or redeemable only on the happening of a contingency, however remote, or on the expiration of a period, however long.

(b)


the company has, by a resolution of the shareholders, manifested its intention that the debenture be cancelled.
