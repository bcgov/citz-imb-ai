whether the charges are excessive in relation to the capital cost of prevailing standards of service in the city;

e

)



any other information prescribed by regulation.

(

a

)



to pay the capital costs of providing, constructing, altering or expanding amenities specified in the amenity cost charge by-law under section 523K (1) (b), or







(

b

)



to pay a person subject to an amenity cost charge for some or all of the capital costs the person incurred in completing a project referred to in paragraph (a) if

2023-46-11.










Provision of amenity instead of all or part of charge







523M.




(

1

)



Despite an amenity cost charge by-law, the Council may, by by-law and in accordance with this section, enter into an agreement with a person under which the person provides, constructs, alters or expands an amenity, or provides land for an amenity, instead of paying all or part of an amenity cost charge.







(

2

)



An amenity referred to in subsection (1) must







(

a

)



be an amenity that is specified in the amenity cost charge by-law under section 523K (1) (b), and







(

b

)



have a location acceptable to the Council.







(

3

)



Without limiting the matters that may be dealt with in an agreement under subsection (1), the agreement must specify the following:

a

)



the amenity to be provided, constructed, altered or expanded or the land to be provided for the amenity;

b

)



the location of the amenity or land;

who is to provide, construct, alter or expand the amenity or provide the land;







(

d

)



when the amenity is to be provided, constructed, altered or expanded or when the land is to be provided;

the payment or crediting to the person of the amount, if any, by which the value of the amenity or land exceeds the amount of the amenity cost charge;







(

h

)



any other information prescribed by regulation.







(

Effect of by-laws adopted or amended after application for rezoning, development permit or building permit submitted







523N.

1

)



In this section,



"

in-stream

"



and



"

precursor application

"



have the same meaning as in section 523D (8.3)



[development cost levies]



.







(

2

)



An initial amenity cost charge by-law that would otherwise be applicable to the construction, alteration or extension of a building or structure, or part of a building or structure, has no effect with respect to that construction, alteration or extension if a precursor application to the building permit authorizing that construction, alteration or extension is in-stream on the date the initial by-law is adopted.







(

3

)



An amended amenity cost charge by-law that would otherwise be applicable to the construction, alteration or extension of a building or structure, or part of a building or structure, has no effect with respect to that construction, alteration or extension if







(

a

)



the building permit authorizing that construction, alteration or extension is issued within 12 months, or any longer period prescribed by regulation, after the date the by-law is amended, and







(

b

)



a precursor application to the building permit is in-stream on the date the by-law is amended,




unless the applicant for that building permit agrees in writing that the amended by-law should have effect.
