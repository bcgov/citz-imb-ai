in the case of a by-law under subsection (1), the by-law establishes a procedure to allow property owners to complain to the Council, sitting as a Court of Revision, about errors made in applying the by-law to their property.






(5)


Subject to any regulation made under subsection (11), a by-law under subsection (1) may






(a)


apply to one or more property classes, or






(b)


modify the averaging formula in subsection (2) or the phasing formula in subsection (3) to exempt from the by-law or govern the application of the by-law to particular types of property within a property class.






(6)

sections 119 and 137 of the


School Act

South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Act


;

the value determined under the by-law, and not the assessed value or the net taxable value referred to in this or any other Act, shall be the basis for taxing properties within the property classes specified in the by-law to raise the money required under the provisions referred to in paragraph (a).






(8)


If






(a)


a body other than the Council sets a rate under an enactment for calculating property taxes, and






(b)


the Council adopts a by-law under subsection (1),


then, despite any other Act, the Council shall, by resolution, substitute a rate that is sufficient to raise the same amount of revenue in the city for that body from each property class to which the by-law applies as the amount that would have been raised for that body had that by-law not been adopted.






(9)


If the amount of revenue raised in any year for a body under subsection (8) is more or less than the amount that would have been raised had the Council not substituted the rate, the difference must be used to adjust the rate for the next year.






(10)

Mode of recovering parcel from defaulting owner





451.



(1)


If the city as purchaser at a tax sale becomes the registered owner of a parcel and subsequently enters into an agreement to sell such parcel, and if the purchaser under such agreement makes default in the payment of principal, interest, taxes, or other charges due thereunder, the city need not bring an action to enforce its rights but may instead, if the Council by resolution so directs, cause notice to be given to the purchaser in writing at the address given in the agreement referring to this section and demanding payment of the amount in default to the city within ninety days from the giving of the notice and warning the purchaser that upon the purchaser's failure to remedy the default within the said ninety days, the purchaser and those claiming under or through the purchaser will forfeit any interest in the said parcel, together with any sums theretofore paid to the city under the agreement. If the purchaser fails to remedy the default within the said period of ninety days, all the right, title, and interest of the purchaser under the agreement, and all those claiming under or through the purchaser, shall, at the expiration of such period, absolutely cease and determine, and the parcel shall immediately become revested in the city, free from all claims by the purchaser, or anyone claiming under or through the purchaser, and, notwithstanding any Statute or rule of law or equity to the contrary, all payments made to the city under the said agreement shall be forfeited to the city. The city may file with the Registrar of Land Titles a statutory declaration proving such resolution, the giving of the notice, and the continued default, and thereupon the Registrar shall cancel any charge or encumbrance registered against the parcel in respect of the agreement.






(2)


Where any parcel becomes revested in the city under subsection (1), the city may cause notice to be given to any occupant of such parcel requiring the occupant to vacate forthwith and giving to the occupant four weeks' notice of the city's intention to sue out a writ of possession of such parcel in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and unless within such four weeks the occupant vacates the parcel or registers a certificate of pending litigation against the parcel, the city shall, without any order for that purpose, be entitled to sue out such writ of possession on filing with the District Registrar of the Court an affidavit proving service of the notice and failure to vacate.

Surplus in hands of Collector





452.



If the purchaser of a parcel at a tax sale completes a purchase by paying to the Collector a sum in excess of the upset price, together with the delinquent taxes and interest required of the purchaser under section 439, the owner, or owner under agreement, at the expiration of the period of redemption, or such other person as may be legally entitled to it, may claim such excess from the city. To the person establishing a claim to the satisfaction of the Collector, the city shall pay the excess.
