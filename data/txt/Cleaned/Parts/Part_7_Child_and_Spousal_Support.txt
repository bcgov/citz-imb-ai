Division 2 — Child Support







Duty to provide support for child





147



(1)


Each parent and guardian of a child has a duty to provide support for the child, unless the child






(a)


is a spouse, or






(b)


is under 19 years of age and has voluntarily withdrawn from the child's parents' or guardians' charge, except if the child withdrew because of family violence or because the child's circumstances were, considered objectively, intolerable.






(2)


If a child referred to in subsection (1) (b) returns to the child's parents' or guardians' charge, their duty to provide support for the child resumes.






(3)


If a guardian who is not the child's parent has a duty to provide support for that child, the guardian's duty is secondary to that of the child's parents.






(4)


A child's stepparent does not have a duty to provide support for the child unless






(a)


the stepparent contributed to the support of the child for at least one year, and






(b)


a proceeding for an order under this Part, against the stepparent, is started within one year after the date the stepparent last contributed to the support of the child.






(5)


If a stepparent has a duty to provide support for a child under subsection (4), the stepparent's duty






(a)


is secondary to that of the child's parents and guardians, and






(b)


extends only as appropriate on consideration of






(i)


the standard of living experienced by the child during the relationship between the stepparent and the step-parent's spouse, and






(ii)


the length of time during which the child lived with the stepparent.








Agreements respecting child support





148



(1)


An agreement respecting child support is binding only if the agreement is made






(a)


after separation, or






(b)


when the parties are about to separate, for the purpose of being effective on separation.






(2)


A written agreement respecting child support that is filed in the court is enforceable under this Act and the


Family Maintenance Enforcement Act


as if it were an order of the court.






(3)


On application by a party, the court may set aside or replace with an order made under this Division all or part of an agreement respecting child support if the court would make a different order on consideration of the matters set out in section 150

[determining child support]

.

(2)


An application may be made by






(a)


a child's parent or guardian,






(b)


the child or a person acting on behalf of the child, or






(c)


if the right to apply for an order under this section is assigned to a minister under the


Employment and Assistance Act


or the


Employment and Assistance for Persons with Disabilities Act


, the minister to whom the right is assigned in the name of the government or the name of the person who made the assignment.






(3)

the stepparent has a duty to provide for the child under section 147 (4)

[duty to provide support for child]

, and






(b)


the stepparent and the child's parent are separated.






(4)


The making of an order against one person for the support of a child does not affect the liability of, or prevent the making of an order against, any other person responsible for the support of the child.








Determining child support





150



(1)


If a court makes an order respecting child support, the amount of child support must be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines.






(2)

the parties consent under section 219

[persons may consent to order being made]

or have an agreement respecting child support, and






(b)


the court is satisfied that reasonable arrangements have been made for the support of the child.






(3)


The court must consider the child support guidelines for the purposes of subsection (2), but must not consider arrangements made for the support of the child to be unreasonable only because the amount required under the child support guidelines differs from those arrangements.






(4)


Despite subsection (1), a court may order child support in an amount different from that required by the child support guidelines if satisfied that






(a)


an agreement or order respecting the financial duties of the parents or guardians or the division or transfer of property, other than an agreement respecting child support, benefits the child directly or indirectly, or that special provisions have otherwise been made for the benefit of the child, and






(b)


applying the child support guidelines would be inequitable on consideration of the agreement, order or special provisions.






(5)


If a court makes an order respecting child support in an amount different from that required under the child support guidelines, it must give reasons for doing so.

an agreement between the spouses, or an order, relating to the support of either spouse.








Agreements respecting spousal support





163

a spouse took improper advantage of the other spouse's vulnerability, including the other party's ignorance, need or distress;

(5)


Despite subsection (3), the court may set aside or replace with an order made under this Division all or part of an agreement if satisfied that none of the circumstances described in that subsection existed when the parties entered into the agreement but that the agreement is significantly unfair on consideration of the following:






(a)


the length of time that has passed since the agreement was made;

any changes, since the agreement was made, in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of a spouse;

(e)


the degree to which the agreement meets the objectives set out in section 161

[objectives of spousal support]

(3)

[setting aside agreements respecting spousal support]

, unless all or part of the agreement is set aside under that section.








Misconduct of spouse





166



In making an order respecting spousal support, the court must not consider any misconduct of a spouse, except conduct that arbitrarily or unreasonably






(a)


causes, prolongs or aggravates the need for spousal support, or






(b)


affects the ability to provide spousal support.








Changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting spousal support





167



(1)


On application, a court may change, suspend or terminate an order respecting spousal support, and may do so prospectively or retroactively.

arises from a change described in subsection (2) (a), and

the changed circumstances, had they existed at the time the order was made, would likely have resulted in a different order.

the person receiving support may make an application under section 149

[orders respecting child support]

or 165

[orders respecting spousal support]

, and

(b)

the efforts of the person responsible for paying support to comply with the agreement or order respecting support,






(b)


the reasons why the person responsible for paying support cannot pay the arrears owing, and






(c)


any circumstances that the court considers relevant.






(3)


If a court reduces arrears under this section, the court may order that interest does not accrue on the reduced arrears if satisfied that it would be grossly unfair not to make such an order.
