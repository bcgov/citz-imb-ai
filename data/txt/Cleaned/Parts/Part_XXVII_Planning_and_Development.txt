providing that the failure to obtain a permit required under section 193D in relation to the same property is a basis for refusing to issue a development permit;

(4)


Where the use of land or the siting of existing buildings and structures on the land ceases, as a result of expropriation of land, to conform to a zoning by-law under this Part, the remainder of the property is deemed to conform, unless compensation was paid to the owner or occupant of the land in an amount that is directly attributable to the loss, if any, suffered by that owner or occupant as a result of the non-conformity.

(3)


In the event that the Council does not within the said period of sixty days adopt any such plan, alteration, addition, extension, or by-law, the owners of the land in respect of which a development permit was withheld or conditions were imposed pursuant to this section shall be entitled to compensation for damages arising from the withholding of such development permit, or the imposition of such conditions. Such compensation shall be determined by arbitration pursuant to the


Arbitration Act


.






(4)


Despite subsection (1), an owner of property for which a permit has been withheld before the adoption of a by-law designating a heritage property may agree that a permit may be withheld for a period longer than the 30 days referred to in subsection (1) and, in that case, subsection (1) continues to apply during that longer period and subsection (2) is deemed to read as if the longer period applies.
