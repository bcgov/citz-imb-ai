(b)


the medical condition of the worker is at issue in the appeal;






(c)


the appeal tribunal determines that the independent assistance or advice
would assist in reaching a decision on the appeal.

to be answered in the report.






(3)


If a health professional retained under this section considers it necessary to
examine a worker in order to provide the independent assistance or advice set out in
the terms of reference under subsection (2), the health professional may require the
worker to attend for an examination by giving the worker written notice.






(4)

Appeal tribunal decision making





303



(1)


The appeal tribunal may consider all questions of fact and law arising in an
appeal, but is not bound by legal precedent.

The appeal tribunal must make its decision based on the merits and justice of
the case, but in doing this the appeal tribunal must apply any policies of the board
of directors that are applicable in that case.






(3)


Despite subsection (1), the appeal tribunal is bound by a prior decision of a
panel appointed under section 285 (6)

[matters of importance to the workers'
compensation system as a whole]

unless






(a)


the specific circumstances of the matter under appeal are clearly
distinguishable from the circumstances addressed in the prior decision,

after the prior decision, a policy of the board of directors that the panel
relied on in the prior decision was repealed, replaced or revised, or

the prior decision has been overruled under subsection (4) of this
section.






(4)


Despite subsection (3), a panel appointed under section 285 (6) may overrule a
prior decision of another panel appointed under that section.






(5)


If the appeal tribunal is hearing an appeal respecting the compensation of a
worker and the evidence supporting different findings on an issue is evenly weighted
in that case, the appeal tribunal must resolve that issue in a manner that favours the
worker.








Application of policies of the board of directors





304



(1)


The appeal tribunal may refuse to apply a policy of the board of directors
only if the policy is so patently unreasonable that it is not capable of being
supported by this Act and the regulations under this Act.






(2)


If, in an appeal, the appeal tribunal considers that a policy of the board of
directors should not be applied, that issue must be referred to the chair and the
appeal proceedings must be suspended until the chair makes a determination under
subsection (4) or the board of directors makes a determination under subsection (6),
as the case may be.






(3)


As soon as practicable after an issue is referred under subsection (2), the
chair must determine whether the policy should be applied.






(4)


If the chair determines under subsection (3) that the policy should be
applied, the chair must refer the matter back to the appeal tribunal and the tribunal
is bound by that determination.






(5)


If the chair determines under subsection (3) that the policy should not be
applied, the chair must






(a)


send a notice of this determination, including the chair's written reasons,
to the board of directors, and






(b)


suspend, until the board of directors makes a determination under subsection
(6), any other appeal proceedings that are pending before the appeal tribunal and
that the chair considers to be affected by the same policy.






(6)


Within 90 days after receiving a notice under subsection (5) (a), the board of
directors must review the policy and determine whether the appeal tribunal may refuse
to apply it under subsection (1).






(7)


On a review under subsection (6), the board of directors must provide the
following with an opportunity to make written submissions:






(a)


the parties to the appeal referred to in subsection (2);






(b)


the parties to any appeals that were pending before the appeal tribunal on
the date the chair sent a notice under subsection (5) (a) and that were suspended
under subsection (5) (b).






(8)


After the board of directors makes a determination under subsection (6), the
board of directors must refer the matter back to the appeal tribunal, and the appeal
tribunal is bound by that determination.






(9)


The chair must not make a general delegation of the chair's authority under
subsection (3), (4) or (5) but, if the chair considers there may be a reasonable
apprehension of bias, the chair may delegate this authority to a vice chair or to a
panel of the appeal tribunal for the purposes of a specific appeal.








Suspension of appeal proceedings pending Board
decision





305



(1)


On application of the appellant or on the chair's own initiative, the chair

made, the appellant may request the appeal tribunal to continue the appeal proceedings
and, on receiving that request, the appeal tribunal must continue the

direct the appeal tribunal to continue the proceedings, or

continue the suspension until the Board's decision is made.






(4)


The chair may extend the time to make a request under subsection (2),
including making an extension of the time after the time to make the request has
expired, if this is done on application and the chair is satisfied that






(a)


special circumstances existed that preclude or precluded the making of a
request within the time required by subsection (2), and






(b)


an injustice would otherwise result.








Decision on appeal





306



(1)


On an appeal, the appeal tribunal may confirm, vary or cancel the appealed
decision or order.

reopened;






(b)


the matter that is the subject of the application under section 125 may not
be reopened.

[Board provision of policies and
records]

respecting the matter under appeal, or






(b)


if a shorter time period is prescribed by the Lieutenant Governor in
Council, within that shorter time period.

if

the complexity of the proceedings in the appeal or of the matter under
appeal makes the time period impractical, or






(b)


the appellant requests a delay in the proceedings to submit new evidence or
make additional submissions.






(6)


If the appellant has requested a delay for a reason referred to in subsection
(5) (b), the chair may extend the time for not more than 45 days.






(7)

extend the time for an additional period not longer than that granted under subsection
(6) to allow the other parties to the appeal to submit new evidence or to make
additional submissions.






(8)


The chair may extend the time under this section even if the applicable time
period under subsection (4) has expired.

(4)


The appeal tribunal may not amend a final decision other than in those

defect.
