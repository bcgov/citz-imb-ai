voting on a question under section 184.






(2)


Except as otherwise provided, Part I

Division (2) — Assent of the Electors







How assent is obtained





131.



(1)


Unless otherwise provided in this Act, if assent of the electors to a by-law or other matter is required or wanted, that assent is obtained only if a majority of the votes counted as valid are in favour of the by-law or question.






(2)


If a by-law that requires the assent of the electors does not receive that assent, no other by-law for the same purpose may be submitted to the electors within a period of 6 months from the last submission except with the approval of the minister.






(3)


Despite section 27 (4) of the


Interpretation Act


, a by-law to which that section applies in relation to assent of the electors may be amended or repealed without the assent of the electors if the minister approves.


1993-54-61; B.C. Reg. 5/2010.








Each by-law to be voted on must be for a distinct purpose





132.



(1)


A by-law submitted for the assent of electors must be for only one distinct purpose, although the by-law may include purposes incidental to the main purpose.






(2)


If 2 or more by-laws are submitted at the same time for assent of the electors, each by-law must be voted on as a separate question unless otherwise provided in this Act.
