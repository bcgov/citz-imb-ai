The matters for which the approving officer may refuse to approve a subdivision plan in respect of a parcel of Nisg̱a'a Lands under subsection (1) are in addition to any other matters for which the approving officer may refuse approval under section 86 (1) (c), as that section applies to that parcel under the Nisg̱a'a Final Agreement.

to vest in the Nisg̱a'a Nation or the applicable Nisg̱a'a Village, subject to any Nisg̱a'a law, title to the highway, park or public square, except any mineral resources, as defined in the Nisg̱a'a Final Agreement, that are registered in the name of a person other than the owner, and
