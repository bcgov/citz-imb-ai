Financial Administration Act


in securities approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.






(2)


If at any time the assurance fund is reduced to an amount below the sum of $50 000 by payment of claims or otherwise, sufficient money must be paid into the fund out of the consolidated revenue fund to maintain the fund at not less than $50 000.








Application of this Part





295.1

In this Part,

"court"

means the Supreme Court.






(2)


A person, in this Part referred to as the "claimant",






(a)


who is deprived of any estate or interest in land






(i)


because of the conclusiveness of the register, in circumstances where, if this Act had not been passed, the claimant would have been entitled to recover the land from the present owner, and






(ii)


in consequence of fraud or a wrongful act in respect of the registration of a person other than the claimant as owner of the land, and






(b)


who is barred by this Act or by any other Act, or otherwise precluded from bringing an action






(i)


for possession, or any other remedy for the recovery of land, or






(ii)


for rectification of the register,


may, subject to subsections (3) and (4), proceed in court for the recovery of damages against the person by whose fraud or wrongful act the claimant has been deprived of the land.






(3)


In a proceeding under subsection (2), the minister must be joined as a nominal party defendant as a condition of recovering damages and costs from the assurance fund, and the minister has the right in the proceedings to all the defences available to the minister or any other person for the purpose of protecting the assurance fund.






(4)


If the person liable for damages is dead, or cannot be found in British Columbia, a claimant may, instead of proceeding against that person, proceed in court for the recovery of damages and costs against the minister as nominal defendant and recovering the amount of the damages and costs from the assurance fund, and the minister has in the proceedings all the rights and defences under subsection (3).






(5)


If






(a)


final judgment has been given against the person liable for damages under subsection (2) in a proceeding in which the minister has been joined as a party defendant, and






(b)


the court, on the application of the plaintiff supported by evidence satisfactory to the court, certifies to the minister charged with the administration of the


Financial Administration Act


that the plaintiff has taken all reasonable steps to recover the amount of damages and costs awarded by the judgment from the person so liable, but the plaintiff has been unable to recover all or part of them,


on receipt of a certified copy of the judgment and the certificate of the court, the minister charged with the administration of the


Financial Administration Act


must






(c)


pay the amount of the damages and costs so awarded or the unrecovered balance of them, as the case may be, on account of the person liable for the damages or the person's personal representatives, and






(d)


charge the amount to the assurance fund.






(6)


If the person bringing an action under subsection (4) recovers final judgment against the minister, the registrar of the court must certify to the minister charged with the administration of the


Financial Administration Act


the fact of the judgment and the amount of the damages and costs recovered.






(7)


On receipt of a certificate under subsection (6), the minister charged with the administration of the


Financial Administration Act


must pay the amount of the damages and costs on account of the person liable for the damages or the person's personal representative, and must charge the amount to the assurance fund.






(8)


A proceeding for the recovery of damages sustained through the deprivation of land may not be brought under this section






(a)


against the minister, or






(b)


against the person by whose fraud or wrongful act the person entitled to the land has been deprived of it,


unless the proceeding is commenced within 3 years after the deprivation is discovered by the claimant.






(9)


If a person is under a disability, the


Limitation Act


applies to this section.








Protection of purchaser in good faith and for value





297



(1)


In this section,

"transferee"

means a transferee who, in good faith and for valuable consideration, acquires an estate or interest in land less than a fee simple estate.






(2)


Despite anything to the contrary in this Act, no transferee is subject to a proceeding under this Part in respect of an estate or interest in land of which the transferee is the registered owner, for






(a)


recovery of land,






(b)


deprivation of land, or






(c)


damages in respect of land


on the ground that the transferor






(d)


may have been registered as owner through fraud, error or a wrongful act, or






(e)


may have derived title from or through a person registered as owner through fraud, error or a wrongful act.






(3)


[Repealed 2005-35-18.]

A person sustaining loss or damages caused, solely or partially, as a result of an omission, mistake or misfeasance of the registrar, or a person acting under the registrar's direction, in the execution of their respective duties under this Act, may, subject to section 303, proceed in the Supreme Court against the minister as nominal defendant for the purpose of recovering the amount of the loss or damages and costs from the assurance fund.






(2)


Despite the


Limitation Act


, an action may not be brought against the minister under this section unless the action is commenced within 3 years after the loss or damage is discovered by the claimant.

Financial Administration Act


the fact of the judgment and the amount of the damages and costs recovered.
