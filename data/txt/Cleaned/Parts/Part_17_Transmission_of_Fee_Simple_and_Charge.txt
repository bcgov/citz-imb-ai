to section 276, conclusive and is deemed to be the true and
correct title from the time of registration, free from encumbrances,
and is conclusive evidence that every application, notice,
publication, proceeding, consent and act whatever that ought to have
been made, given and done before the issue of the certificate by the
collector or other proper officer has been made, given and done by the
proper authority to the proper persons.
