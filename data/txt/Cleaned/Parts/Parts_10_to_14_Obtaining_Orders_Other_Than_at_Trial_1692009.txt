Copy of affidavit must be furnished






(60)


A party seeking to introduce evidence by affidavit must serve a copy of the affidavit on all parties at least 28 days, or such lesser period as may be ordered by the court, before the application referred to in subrule (59).








Cross-examination






(61)


If a copy of an affidavit of a witness is served under subrule (60), any party may, unless the court otherwise orders, require the witness to be called for cross-examination at trial, provided that that party gives to the party seeking to introduce the evidence by affidavit notice of the requirement within 14 days after receiving the affidavit.








Court may extend or abridge time to require witness attendance






(62)


If a copy of an affidavit is served under subrule (60) less than 28 days before the application referred to in subrule (59), the court may extend or abridge the time referred to in subrule (61) within which parties may require the attendance of the witness at trial for cross-examination.

Costs where attendance unnecessary






(65)


If a witness has been required to give evidence under subrule (61) or (62), and the court is of the opinion that the evidence obtained does not materially add to the information in the affidavit furnished under subrule (60), the court may order the party that required the attendance of the witness to pay, as costs, an amount the court considers appropriate.
