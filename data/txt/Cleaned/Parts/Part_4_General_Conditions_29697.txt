(section 4.58 [specifications for guards and guardrails])




WorkSafeBC Standard — Guardrails Using Rope or Other Non-rigid Material








Scope





1



This standard sets out the minimum requirements for the design and use of a guardrail system temporarily installed in a workplace and made using a rope rail for part or all of the top rail or midrail of the guardrail system.








Definitions





2



In this standard:



"fall protection system"

has the same meaning as in section 11.1 of this Regulation;



"guardrail"

has the same meaning as in section 4.54 of this Regulation;



"rope rail"

means a rail made of fibre rope, wire rope, chain or other non-rigid material.








Performance and material requirements





3



(1)


A rope rail must be able to withstand a load of 550 N (125 lb.) applied in any direction at any point on the rope rail.






(2)


A guardrail system using a rope rail must be installed with sufficient setback from the outer face of the parapet, the floor opening or the open edge of the floor or work surface, as the case may be, or from any other hazard, such that when the rope rail is subjected to a horizontal load of 550 N (125 lb.) applied at any point, the rope rail will not deflect






(a)


past the outer face of the parapet,






(b)


past the edge of the floor opening,






(c)


past the open edge of the floor or work surface, or






(d)


into the hazard.






(3)


A rope rail must be made of a material that will remain stable and functional, having regard to the following:






(a)


climatic conditions;






(b)


exposure to






(i)


high temperature sources, or






(ii)


by-products of high temperature processes such as welding or cutting;






(c)


chemical exposures that may occur due to






(i)


the location of the workplace where the guardrail system is to be installed, or






(ii)


the work that will be taking place around or near the guardrail system.






(4)


A rope rail must not be made of natural fibre rope or other material relying on natural fibre for tensile strength.








Engineering requirements





4



(1)


A rope rail must be installed and used in accordance with written instructions from a professional engineer.






(2)


The written instructions required by subsection (1) must include the following:






(a)


the seal and signature of the professional engineer providing the written instructions;






(b)


the address of and location in the workplace where the guardrail system is to be used;






(c)


the name of each employer, prime contractor or owner for whom the written instructions were prepared;






(d)


a description of the guardrail system or an illustration for its configuration;






(e)


details for the connection of the rope rail to supports and anchors;






(f)


details on the size and grade of rope and all required rigging hardware to be used;






(g)


details for corner posts and points where rope terminations occur;






(h)


the maximum span permitted between supports;






(i)


the tension required in the rope and the means to achieve it;






(j)


the means for testing rope tension during inspections of the system.






(3)


The written instructions for a guardrail system intended for use at a number of workplaces of similar design and construction must include the following:






(a)


the seal and signature of the professional engineer providing the written instructions;






(b)


a description of the type of structure where the guardrail system may be used;






(c)


the name of each employer, prime contractor or owner for whom the written instructions were prepared;






(d)


a description of the guardrail system or an illustration for its configuration;






(e)


details for the connection of the rope rail to supports and anchors;






(f)


details on the size and grade of rope and all required rigging hardware to be used;






(g)


details for corner posts and points where rope terminations occur;

Installation and use requirements





5



(1)


A worker involved in the installation, maintenance or removal of a guardrail system described in section 1

[scope]

must use a fall protection system if required by Part 11

[Fall Protection]

of this regulation.






(2)


A rope rail meeting this standard is intended for use only as a guardrail and must not be used as a horizontal lifeline unless a professional engineer specifically authorizes such use and provides written instructions for such use.






(3)


If the lack of visibility of a rope rail is a hazard, high visibility coloured markers or flagging must be installed on the top rail of the guardrail system at intervals not exceeding 2 m (6.5 ft.).






(4)


Once installation of a guardrail system described in section 1

[scope]

is complete and before the system is relied on as the fall protection system for the work area, the employer must ensure the following:






(a)


the rope rail and the guardrail system is inspected by a qualified person;






(b)


the qualified person is satisfied that the installation conforms to the written instructions of the professional engineer required by section 4 of this Schedule;






(c)


the qualified person provides the employer with a written record of the inspection that states that the guardrail system is properly installed;






(d)


a copy of the record referred to in paragraph (c) is available at the workplace where the guardrail system is installed.






(5)


In addition to the inspection required by subsection (4), the employer must ensure that the rope rail and the guardrail system is inspected by a qualified person at the start of each work shift to verify that






(a)


the rope rail meets the tension requirements of section 3 (1) and (2) of this Schedule, and






(b)


the guardrail system conforms to the written instructions referred to in subsection (4) (b) of this section.






(6)


If, on inspection under subsection (5) or at any other time, the qualified person or any other person finds that






(a)


the rope rail does not meet the tension requirements referred to in subsection (5), or






(b)


the guardrail system does not conform to the written instructions referred to in subsection (4) (b),


no work is to take place in the affected area until the deficiency is corrected or the workers in the area are protected by an alternative fall protection system meeting the requirements of Part 11

[Fall Protection]

of this Regulation.
