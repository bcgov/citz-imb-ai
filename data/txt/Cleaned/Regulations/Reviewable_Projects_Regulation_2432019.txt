In this regulation:



"Act"

means the


Environmental Assessment Act


;



"applicable table"

, in relation to a new project, a modification to an existing project or the dismantling and abandonment of an existing project, means whichever of Tables 1 to 14 lists in Column 1 the category of project within which the new or existing project fits;



"carbon dioxide equivalent"

has the same meaning as in the


Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act


;

"foreshore"

means land in tidal or non-tidal areas that, as a result of the rise and fall of the sea or water in an estuary or stream between the natural boundary and the ordinary low water mark, is periodically covered by salt water or fresh water and periodically exposed;



"greenhouse gas"

How to calculate total waste discharge





2



(1)


The total waste discharge for a project is the quantity of waste that is permitted under the


Environmental Management Act


to be discharged from the project.






(2)


The total waste discharge for a project is calculated by adding the products obtained by multiplying the CWF for each permitted contaminant by the permitted discharge rate, in tonnes or other unit of measurement specified in Appendix 1, for that contaminant.








Reviewable projects prescribed





3



(1)


A new project that is in a category described in Column 1 of the applicable table is prescribed as a reviewable project if it meets the criteria set out opposite in Column 2.
