agreeing to lend the

principal

, the

borrower

grants and
mortgages the

land

to the

lender

as security for repayment
of the

mortgage money

and for performance of all the

borrower's
promises and agreements

.






(2)


If the interest mortgaged is described in the

mortgage form

as a
leasehold interest, the grant in subsection (1) shall be construed as a charge of the
unexpired term of the

lease

less the last month of that term.






(3)


This means that






(a)



this mortgage

shall be a charge on the land, and






(b)


the

borrower

releases to the

lender

all the

borrower

's claim to the

land

until the

borrower

has paid the

mortgage money

to the

lender

, in accordance with these mortgage terms, and has performed
all of the

borrower's promises and agreements

.






(4)


The

borrower

may continue to remain in possession of the

land

as long as the

borrower

performs all of the

borrower's promises and agreements

.






(5)


When the

borrower

has paid the

mortgage money

and
performed all the

borrower's promises and agreements

under

this
mortgage

and the

lender

has no obligation to make any further
advances or readvances, the

lender

will no longer be entitled to enforce
any rights under

this mortgage

and the

borrower

will be
entitled, at the

borrower

's cost, to receive a discharge of

this
mortgage

. The discharge must be signed by the

lender

and must
be registered by the

borrower

in the land title office to cancel the
registration of

this mortgage

against the

land

.








Interest





3



(1)


Interest is chargeable on the

mortgage money

and is payable by
the

borrower

.






(2)



Interest

is not payable in advance. This means that

interest

must be earned before it is payable.






(3)



Interest

on advances or readvances of the

principal amount

starts on the date and on the amount of each advance or readvance and accrues on the

principal amount

until the

borrower

has paid all the

mortgage money

.






(4)



Interest

payable on any part of the

principal amount

advanced before the

interest adjustment date

is due and payable to the

lender

on the

interest adjustment date

.






(5)


At the end of each

interest calculation period

, unpaid accrued

interest

will be added to the

principal amount

and bear

interest

. This is known as compound interest.
