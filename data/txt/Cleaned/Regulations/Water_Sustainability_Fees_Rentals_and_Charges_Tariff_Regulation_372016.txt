The annual rental for a licensee who holds one or more licences for a power purpose in relation to more than one power development is the sum of the following:






(a)


if the amount calculated under subsection (1) for one or more of the power developments is less than or equal to the amount set out in column 3 opposite the minimum annual rental set out in column 2 of Table 2 of Schedule 2 for the power use category set out opposite in column 1, the sum of the minimum annual rentals for those power developments;






(b)


if the amount calculated under subsection (1) for one or more of the power developments is greater than the amount set out in column 2 opposite the minimum annual rental set out in column 2 of Table 2 of Schedule 2 for the power use category set out opposite in column 1, the sum of the following for those power developments:






(i)


the amount determined by multiplying the sum of the construction capacities for those power developments by the applicable rate set out in column 3 of Table 2 of Schedule 2 for construction capacity opposite the power use category set out in column 1;






(ii)


the amount determined by multiplying the sum of the operating capacities for those power developments by the applicable rate set out in column 3 of Table 2 of Schedule 2 for operating capacity opposite the power use category set out in column 1;






(iii)


the amount determined by multiplying the sum of the outputs for those power developments by the applicable rate set out in column 3 of Table 2 of Schedule 2 for output opposite the power use category set out in column 1 and the applicable class of output set out in column 2.






(4)


For the purposes of determining rental amounts for the current calendar year in relation to a licensee, the comptroller must use the operating capacity and construction capacity for the current calendar year and output of the power development for the previous calendar year, and the comptroller may estimate that operating capacity and construction capacity and determine that output using






(a)


reports submitted by the licensee on request of the comptroller, a water manager or an engineer, including, without limitation, beneficial use declarations,






(b)


power sales records of a licensee and power consumption and output records of adjacent and integrated facilities submitted on request of the comptroller, a water manager or an engineer,






(c)


records produced under section 116 (2)

[records and reporting]

of the Act, and






(d)


other relevant evidence.






(5)


If output transfers in accordance with section 22

[additional fees in respect of certain downstream benefits]

or 26

[consignment agreements]

have taken place in the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year of a determination under subsection (1) of this section, the total of the output referred to in subsection (1) (c) or (3) (b) (iii), as applicable, must be adjusted as required under those sections.






(6)


If the authorized capacity, as defined in section 1 (1) of the Water Regulation, B.C. Reg. 204/88, as it read immediately before its repeal, is expressed in horsepower, the electrical equivalents for operating capacity and output may be determined, for rental purposes, by assuming that one kilowatt is equal to 1.341286 horsepower.








First rental — when due





19



The rental for the balance of the calendar year following the date of issue of a new licence for a power purpose is payable on issue of the licence or when construction of the works authorized under the licence begins, whichever occurs first.








Rate adjustments in certain circumstances





20



(1)


If a licensee in respect of a power development intends to cease operations for the purpose of removing a unit of the power plant from service for replacement of the unit, or a substantial portion of the unit, in order to improve the power plant's efficiency,






(a)


the licensee must notify the comptroller of the intention,






(b)


while the unit is out of service, rentals payable in respect of the power development are to be charged at the rate for construction capacity, and






(c)


if the replacement unit has a greater capacity than the previous unit, but uses no more water, the operating capacity on which rentals are to be charged changes on the date that the unit comes back into service.






(2)


Subsection (1) does not apply if the comptroller is satisfied that the removal or replacement is for purposes of maintenance, whether routine or otherwise.








Rentals for use approval for power purpose





21



(1)


Subject to section 8 (2)

[rentals — use approvals]

, section 18

[determination of fees, rentals and charges]

applies to the determination of the rental payable in relation to a use approval for a power purpose as if the use approval were a licence for that purpose.






(2)


Rentals in relation to a use approval for a power purpose are payable under section 8 in relation to the construction capacity, operating capacity and output of the power development or proposed power development, as those capacities and output are estimated by the comptroller in accordance with this Part.








Additional fees in respect of certain downstream benefits





22



(1)


In this section:



"downstream hydroelectric plant"

means a hydroelectric plant located outside British Columbia and downstream from a storage facility operated in British Columbia by a licensee under the authority of a licence for storage purposes;



"downstream owner"

means an owner, part owner or operator of a downstream hydroelectric plant.






(2)


Subject to subsection (8), the holder of an authorization for storage purposes who






(a)


operates a storage facility for the purpose of enabling a downstream hydroelectric plant to generate greater amounts of electricity than the amount the hydroelectric plant could generate if the storage facility were not available, and






(b)


receives a benefit for doing so from a downstream owner


must pay the fees determined under this section in addition to any fees, rentals or charges payable by the authorization holder for storage purpose under any other provision of this regulation.






(3)


The additional fee referred to in subsection (2) is to be determined at the applicable rate under Table 2 of Schedule 2 for annual rentals for output.






(4)


For the purposes of subsection (3), the rate for output is the higher of the following:






(a)


the rate applicable to the authorization holder in determining the other annual rentals upon output payable by that holder under this regulation for the calendar year in which the fee is payable;






(b)


the rate that would be applicable to the downstream owner in determining annual rentals if the downstream plant were in the Province and the downstream owner were a licensee.






(5)


If the holder of an authorization for storage purposes is also the downstream owner, the additional fee referred to in subsection (2) is to be based on the amount by which the hydroelectric energy available at the downstream hydroelectric plant increases due to the operation of the upstream storage facility.






(6)


If, in return for operating an upstream storage facility, an authorization holder who is not a downstream owner receives hydroelectric energy from the downstream owner, the additional fee referred to in subsection (2) is to be based on the amount of hydroelectric energy so received.






(7)


If, in return for operating an upstream storage facility, an authorization holder who is not a downstream owner receives benefits other than hydroelectric energy from the downstream owner, the additional fee referred to in subsection (2) is the fee that the holder would be required to pay under this section if that holder were a holder described in subsection (5) and receiving 1/2 of the amount by which the hydroelectric energy generated by the downstream plant is increased due to the operation of the upstream storage facility.






(8)


Fees determined under this section are payable in the calendar year following the calendar year in which the licensee incurs the fee, but, for the purpose of the fee calculation under this section, the rate for output is the rate for output for the calendar year in which the fee is payable, despite the fee having been incurred in the preceding calendar year.






(9)


This section does not apply to the power benefits described in the Columbia River Treaty as the Canadian entitlement.








Calculating 1/2 yearly instalment rentals





23



For the purposes of section 7

[rentals due 1/2 yearly if rentals exceed $100 000]

, the following apply in respect of rentals under this Part:






(a)

(b)


the amount of the instalment due March 31 in relation to rentals other than rentals upon output is 1/2 the amount of rentals payable by the licensee for the current calendar year for construction capacity and operating capacity;






(c)


the amount of the instalment due September 30 is the balance of the annual rentals due for the current calendar year after the amounts paid under paragraphs (a) and (b) are deducted.

Statistics Act


(Canada).






(2)


For the purposes of determining a rental rate indicated in a Table 2 of Schedule 2 as being "Adjusted" for a calendar year, the rental rate for the calendar year is the rental rate for the previous calendar year adjusted by the annual percentage change for the previous calendar year.






(3)


The result of a calculation under subsection (2) must be rounded off to the nearest 1/10 of a cent.






(4)


The comptroller must publish annually in the Gazette and on a publicly available website






(a)


the annual percentage change for the previous calendar year, and






(b)


the resulting rental rates for the current calendar year.








Exception to annual rental requirement





25



A licensee is not required to pay annual rentals in respect of hydroelectric energy that the licensee is obliged at law to deliver, free of charge, to an owner or operator of a downstream hydroelectric plant located outside the Province, as compensation for losses of hydroelectric capacity or energy, or both, at that plant suffered as a result of






(a)


the licensee's operation of the upstream storage or power facilities that are the subject of the licensee's licence, or






(b)


filling the licensee's reservoir for the first time.








Consignment agreements





26

In this section

"consignment agreement"

means an agreement between 2 licensees of power developments under which the consignor delivers output to the consignee for the consignee's immediate use and the consignee establishes an energy account in favour of the consignor, in accordance with standard utility practice.






(2)


If a licensee of a power development has reason to believe that






(a)


the quantity of water available for generating output is likely to exceed the amount required to meet the demand for output from the power development, and






(b)


due to insufficient storage capacity, unavoidable spilling of water from the development's reservoir could occur,


the licensee may, with the object of making more effective use of the available water, enter into a consignment agreement with a consignee.






(3)


A licensee who is a consignor under a consignment agreement must notify the comptroller within 90 days after entering into the consignment agreement.






(4)


Disposition of all or part of an energy account established under a consignment agreement may be accomplished or is occasioned by the occurrence of one or more of the following:






(a)


delivery of output to the consignor by the consignee;






(b)


sale of the energy account itself to the consignee by the consignor;






(c)


unavoidable spilling of water from the consignee's reservoir.






(5)


If a consignment agreement has been established, water rentals must be paid on the following basis:






(a)


on delivery of output to the consignee, the consignee is liable for the rentals on the output at the rate the consignee would have paid if that output were produced by the consignee;






(b)


on disposition of all or part of an energy account in the manner described in subsection (4) (a) or (b), the consignor is liable for rentals on the equivalent amount of output at the same rate the consignor pays for output that is produced by the consignor and not delivered to a consignee under a consignment agreement.
