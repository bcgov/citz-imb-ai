Regulation, the minimum coverage for the materials and labour warranty on a building
envelope renovation is 2 years for any defect in materials and labour and for
non-compliance with the building code described in subsection (2).






(2)


Non-compliance with the building code is considered a defect covered by home

If repairs are required under a materials and labour warranty or water

If a warranty provider establishes a maximum amount per day for living-out
expenses, that maximum amount must be not less than $100 per day for the complete
reimbursement of the actual accommodation expenses incurred by a holder or member of a
holder corporation at a hotel, motel or other rental accommodation up to the day the

receiving 24 hours advance notice that the residential building will be ready for
occupancy on that day.
