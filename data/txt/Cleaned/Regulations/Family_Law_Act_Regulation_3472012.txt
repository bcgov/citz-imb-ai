Important Information



A guardian who holds money or other property for a child as a trustee under section 178 of the

Family Law Act

must comply with section 15.2 of the

Trustee Act

which states that "a trustee must exercise the care, skill, diligence and judgment that a prudent investor would exercise in making investments".


Money or other property held by the guardian belongs to the child. The guardian holds and protects it and cannot personally benefit from it. The guardian cannot borrow any of the money or other property and lend it to anyone else. The guardian cannot give it to anybody else to hold as a trustee other than to the person replacing the guardian as guardian.


When the guardian invests a child's money or other property, the guardian must ensure that the investment is registered in the name of the trust or on behalf of the child. A bank, credit union or trust company can assist the guardian in setting up a trust account.


Only the guardian can make a decision about whether to spend any of the income or capital or both. The money or other property can only be used for the sole benefit of the child.


The guardian is accountable for the guardian's management of the money or other property and must keep a record of all transactions, including all financial statements detailing income earned by the money or other property and a record of all money spent.

SECTION 2




CHILD PROTECTION RECORD CHECK






A Child Protection Record Check (CPRC) is a report of prior contact entries in the records collected under the

Child, Family and Community Service Act

(CFCSA) or its predecessor legislation regarding child protection concerns, if any, relating to a person (the "applicant") who is applying for guardianship of a child under the

Family Law Act

(FLA). A CPRC is prepared by a delegated child welfare worker at the Provincial After Hours Programs of the Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD). The CPRC reflects a search of records pertaining to the applicant as an adult or parent and does not reflect a search of records pertaining to the applicant as a child and non-parent. A CPRC documents only those child protection reports that required an investigation or an assessment and does not reflect services that may have been provided to the applicant on a voluntary basis under the CFCSA or its predecessor legislation.


[

Check whichever of the following statements is correct and provide any required information.

]


[ ] I have not been involved at any time in the past, as an adult or parent, with child protection services.


[ ] I have been involved in the past, as an adult or parent, with child protection services, with my first involvement occurring in ..............[

year

].......... .






SECTION 3




REASON FOR REQUESTING A CPRC






Section 51 (2) of the FLA requires an applicant to provide evidence to the court, in accordance with the Supreme Court Family Rules or the Provincial Court Family Rules, respecting the best interests of the child. An applicant must submit a CPRC to the court to assist the court in determining the best interests of the child.


I am applying in the ............................... Registry of the [ ] Supreme Court [ ] Provincial Court under Action No.: ................. for guardianship of:

[ ] this child currently resides with me

[ ] this child does not currently reside with me but will be coming to live with me









SECTION 4




POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF A CPRC






A CPRC may result in any of the following:





1




If a CPRC indicates that there is reason to believe that a child who is currently in, or about to come into, the applicant's care may need protection under section 13 of the CFCSA, the delegated child welfare worker conducting the CPRC will make a report to a local child welfare worker for further assessment under the CFCSA.




2




If a CPRC indicates that the applicant currently has an open child protection file, the delegated child welfare worker conducting the CPRC will notify the child welfare worker with conduct of the open file that the applicant is seeking guardianship under the FLA.




3




In response to a CPRC, a judge may order that records under the CFCSA or predecessor legislation be provided to the court.




4




In response to a CPRC, a judge may order an assessment of the applicant's ability and willingness to satisfy the needs of the child under section 211 of the FLA.




5




The director of the CFCSA may apply for leave to intervene in the guardianship proceedings under the FLA if the director considers it in the best interests of a child to do so.









SECTION 5




CONSENT






I have read and completed sections 1 to 4 and understand what a CPRC will entail, why a CPRC is required for my guardianship application and the possible consequences of a CPRC. I consent to a delegated child welfare worker from MCFD conducting and completing a CPRC for me to submit to the court as evidence in my guardianship application. This consent is valid for one year from the date of signature.
