shall not be smaller than 5 000 square feet, except that a parcel
may be decreased in area by as much as 10%, provided that the
approving officer is satisfied with the validity of the owner's
written claim that, because of unusual terrain or the size or the
configuration of that owner's land, 5 000 square foot parcels
cannot be achieved and therefore subdivision is precluded, but as many
parcels as the approving officer considers practicable shall be not
smaller than 5 000 square feet,




(b)

where both building and zoning regulations are in force, and where a
lane provides secondary access to that parcel, there shall be no
minimum parcel size, and

be, where a parcel is served by a community water system but not a
community sewer system, that parcel shall not be smaller than
7 500 square feet, except that a parcel may be decreased in area
by as much as 10%, provided that the approving officer is satisfied
with the validity of the owner's written claim that, because of
unusual terrain or the size or the configuration of that owner's land,
7 500 square foot lots cannot be achieved and therefore
subdivision is precluded, and that at the decreased size all
requirements of section 6.04 can be met, but as many parcels as
the approving officer considers practicable shall not be smaller than
7 500 square feet.

and which designs are in accordance with the requirement for alternate
methods of disposal contained in the Regulations Governing Sewage
Disposal and for which acceptable alternate designs and adequate area
of appropriate soil is available for disposal, and the parcel shall be
sized accordingly, except that where, in extraordinary and infrequent
instances, the owner of the parcel does not wish to make the
installation necessary for an acceptable alternate design in
accordance with the foregoing, the subdivision may be approved,
provided that the owner agrees in writing to registering a condition
or covenant pursuant to section 219 of the

Land Title Act

in favour of the Crown at the time the subdivision is registered; such
condition or covenant shall be satisfactory to the approving officer
and shall restrict or prohibit the construction of buildings or
structures on and (or) the use of any parcel until the necessary
installations have been made, and


copies of the results of all tests shall contain the signature,
occupation and permanent address of the person undertaking the tests
and shall accompany the plans of the proposed subdivision when it is
submitted to the authority having jurisdiction to receive subdivision
applications.






Design of larger disposal system




6.05


Except where the

Waste Management Act

is applicable, where a parcel is less than 5 acres and is not served
by a community sewer system and where the intended use has a greater
design sewage flow per day than the minimum capacity septic tank for a
3 bedroom, single family house in accordance with the Regulations
Governing Sewage Disposal, the design sewage flow of the intended use
shall be used in accordance with the Regulations Governing Sewage
Disposal to determine the area of soil required in section 6.04 (a)
and all other requirements of section 6.04 shall be met.

health officer or the Regional Waste Manager would or would not
recommend approval of a subdivision based on the waste disposal
capabilities of the soil on that parcel to meet with the requirements
of these regulations or of the

Waste Management Act

, as the case may be.

[am. B.C. Reg. 45/2022, Sch. 3, s. 3.]





Old subdivisions




6.07

Panhandle lots




6.09


Without limiting the generalities of section 4.01 and notwithstanding
the requirements of section 6.08, where a parcel is a panhandle
lot capable of further subdivision, the approving officer shall be
satisfied that the panhandle is adequate to provide a future highway.






Panhandle not part of minimum parcel area




6.10


Notwithstanding the requirements of sections 6.01 to 6.05, inclusive,
where a parcel is a panhandle lot, the access strip or panhandle shall
not be calculated as part of the minimum parcel area.






Where minimum does not apply

Manager of the ministry of the minister responsible for the
administration of the
Transportation Act
approves as worthy of preservation and which are located close to the
edge of a highway allowance intended for vehicular use, the full width
of all highways shall be cleared and grubbed. Brush, debris, stumps
and roots shall be disposed of to the satisfaction of the District
Highway Manager of the ministry of the minister responsible for the
administration of the
Transportation Act
.







11


Roads shall be surfaced in 2 courses:




(a)

a lower course composed of select granular material passing 3 inch
mesh as per Ministry of Transportation Highways specification 202.7,
and




(b)

an upper course composed of a minimum of 3 inches of 3/4 inch crushed
or screened aggregate, as per Ministry of Transportation and Highways
specification 202.4,


and the minimum depth of the 2 courses shall be 6 inches. Where more
material is required to build a sound and uniform roadway, the lower
course shall be increased in depth.







12


The approving officer may also require asphaltic or portland cement
concrete surfacing as per Ministry of Transportation and Highways
specification, sections 220, 222 and 223, to a width not less than 4
feet narrower than the finished road grade width (see section 4).







13


All construction practice and procedure shall be generally to the
standard of the Ministry of Transportation and Highways General
Specifications.




Appendix B


(Sections 6.04 (a) and 6.06)









1


A percolation test shall be made and, depending on the resulting
percolation rate, no less area than given below shall be added to the
minimum parcel size in section 6.02 or 6.03, as the case may be, of
the Subdivision Regulations:





Percolation rate (min./inch)






Minimum area added to

parcel (Sq. Ft.)




Less than 5

0


5 and more, but less than 10

500


10 and more, but less than 15

1 000


15 and more, but less than 20

1 500


20 and more, but less than 25

2 000


25 and more, but less than 30

2 500



When the percolation rate is 30 minutes or more, see section
6.04 (b) of the Subdivision Regulations.

Percolation tests shall be carried out in accordance with
section 6 below.













2


Depending on the slope measured from the uppermost point on the parcel
to the lowest point on the parcel, the results obtained in section 1
above shall be increased in accordance with the following:





Steepest slope (per cent)



Minimum area to be

added to parcel

(sq. ft.)




Less than 10
0



For each 5% or part thereof for 10% and over

500












3


Regardless of the smallest parcel size permitted in accordance with
sections 1 and 2 above, the parcel shall contain an area of soil
suitable for sewage disposal not smaller than the following, as
determined by the percolation rate:





Percolation rate (min./inch)






Minimum size of

area of soil (sq. ft.)




Less than 5

1 000


5 and more, but less than 10

1 500


10 and more, but less than 15

2 000


15 and more, but less than 20

2 500


20 and more, but less than 25

3 000


25 and more, but less than 30

3 500












4


There shall be a minimum of 4 feet of natural porous topsoil above the
groundwater table in the area of soil referred to in section 3 above,
and a representative number of testholes shall be dug in that area to
a minimum depth of 4 feet to demonstrate this.










5


The area of soil required for sewage disposal in section 3 above shall
be capable of meeting the siting requirements for absorption fields in
the Regulations Governing Sewage Disposal.










6


Percolation tests shall be undertaken, as follows:




(a)

Percolation test holes shall be made at points and elevations selected
as typical in the area of the proposed disposal field.




(b)

One of these test holes shall be dug at each end of the area of the
disposal field. Further holes may be required, depending on the nature
of the ground and the results of the first test and the size of the
proposed field.




(c)

Test holes are usually drilled using an auger and to the depth of the
proposed absorption trench. The standard depth is 24 inches, but the
Public Health Inspector may approve or require holes varying from 18
to 32 inches in depth.




(d)

The soil should be examined as it is removed from the test hole for
some indication of its composition and likely percolation rate.




(e)

To make the percolation test more accurate, any smeared soil should be
removed from the walls of the test hole.




(f)

If the soil contains considerable amounts of silt and (or) clay, the
test hole should be presoaked before proceeding with the test. To do
this, keep the hole as fully filled with water as possible for 4
hours. Proceed with the test immediately after presoaking.




(g)

To undertake the test, fill the test hole with water. When the water
level is 5 inches or less from the bottom of the hole, refill the hole
to a depth of 24 inches or to the top. No recording of time need be
done for these 2 fillings.




(h)

When the water level after the second filling (step (g)) is 5 inches
or less from the bottom of the hole, add enough water to bring the
depth of water to 6 inches or more.




(i)

Observe the water level until it drops to the 6 inch depth. At
precisely 6 inches, commence timing. When the water level reaches
precisely 5 inches depth, stop timing.




(j)

The time in minutes for the water level to drop 1 inch is the
percolation rate for that hole and is recorded in minutes per inch.
The percolation rate of the absorption field is the average rate of
all the percolation tests made for that field.




(k)

Backfill the holes with the excavated soil and repeat the test in
other locations. Record the results and submit to the local
authorities.




(l)

See section 4.07 of the Subdivision Regulations.




NOTE ON SECTION 6 — A percolation test is used to measure the
permeability of the soil at the depth of the proposed drainage field.
The percolation test will determine the rate, which is a measure of
the time in minutes for the water level in a hole to drop 1 inch (from
6 inches from the bottom to 5 inches from the bottom of the hole) and
is recorded in minutes per inch
