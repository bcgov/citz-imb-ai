Price = weight x unit price x germination adjustment










where




weight


=


the weight of the seeds, expressed in kilograms;




unit price


=


the unit price for the seeds specified under subsection (3) or (4) of this section, as applicable;




germination

adjustment


=


the germination adjustment for the seeds determined under subsection (5) of this section.









(3)


Subject to subsection (4), the unit price for seeds is the following:






(a)


the listed price for the seeds, if the seeds are






(i)


orchard seeds collected from

an orchard that receives funding from the government under an agreement to provide seeds to the government, or






(ii)


wild seeds collected before 2004;






(b)


in any other case, the actual cost to the government of acquiring a kilogram of the seeds.






(4)


The unit price for seeds referred to in subsection (3) (a) (i) (A) is 50% of the unit price specified under that subsection if the minister considers, having regard to the genetic quality of the seeds, that the volume of the trees grown from the seeds at the location where the seeds will be planted will not be more than 5% greater than the volume of trees of the same species growing in wild stands at that location.






(5)

if the tested germination rate of the relevant seedlot is less than the germination index for the tree from which that seedlot was collected, the quotient of the tested germination rate and the germination index;
