Private Managed Forest                Land Act


;



"critical wildlife habitat"

means critical wildlife habitat established
or varied under section 5;



"local government"

For the purpose of section 21 (1) of the Act,

"forest management
activity"

means an activity, process or use, including structures and
facilities that support the activity, process or use, that is described in Schedule A and
that is related to or carried out for the production or harvesting of forest resources on
or from the owner's private managed forest lands, for as long as the land is classified
under the


Assessment Act


as managed forest land.


[am. B.C. Reg. 539/2004.]








Exit fees





2



(1)


Subject to section 45 (2) of the Act and section 3 (1), if the assessor
declassifies managed forest land under section 24 (3) (b) of the


Assessment            Act


, the council must






(a)


determine, in accordance with subsection (2), the amount of the exit fee that
the owner of the land is required to pay under section 19 (1) of the Act, and






(b)


notify the owner of the amount of the exit fee.






(2)


For the purpose of subsection (3) the assessor may determine the total
annual property tax that would have been due for the property that is being removed from
the managed forest land class, had that property not been valued and classified as managed
forest land for the immediately preceding tax year roll, less the total property tax that
was payable for the immediately preceding tax year on the property that is being removed
from the managed forest land class.






(3)


The exit fee referred to in subsection (1) is the amount determined by finding the
product of the following:




Total annual property tax as determined under subsection (2)


Multiplied by


Number of consecutive years ending in the current tax year that the property has
been classified as managed forest land


Multiplied by


Adjustment Factor noted in Schedule B for the number of years classified as
managed forest land for assessment purposes.






(4)


If the estimated total annual property taxes for the property for the immediately
preceding tax year based on reclassification out of the managed forest land class is less
than the total annual property taxes payable for the property in the managed forest land
class for the immediately preceding tax year, no exit fee is payable.






(5)


If the property has been classified managed forest land for 15 or more years, no
exit fee is payable.






(6)


In determining the number of years a property was classified as managed forest
land for the purposes of the calculation under subsection (3), the time the
property was classified as managed forest land before the coming into force of this
section will be included.








Exemption from exit fees





3



(1)


For the purpose of section 19 (1) of the Act, the circumstances in which an owner
is not required to pay an exit fee in respect of a portion of land that has been

are that the portion of land






(a)


is subject to a right of way or easement,






(b)


is expropriated,






(c)


is gifted to the government or local government, or






(d)


is subject to a land exchange with the government or local
government.






(2)


Despite subsection (1), if land is declassified as a result of notification to the

section
2.

(a)


the date 14 days after the wildlife minister notifies the owner in

Critical wildlife habitat





5



(1)


The wildlife minister, in accordance with section 7, may

establish or vary an area of private managed forest land as critical wildlife
habitat if






(i)


the habitat of one or more species at risk is located on the land,
and

species at risk because there is insufficient suitable habitat found on Crown lands
within that ecoregion, or






(b)


cancel the establishment of an area as critical wildlife habitat.






(2)


Within an area of critical wildlife habitat, an owner must carry out any timber
harvesting and related activities, and any road construction, in accordance with the

An owner may be required to provide information





6



(1)


If the wildlife minister has reasonable cause to believe that there may be an area
of private managed forest land that qualifies for establishment as critical wildlife

habitat.






(2)


An owner who receives a notice under subsection (1) must give the

notice is received by the owner of the private managed forest land.






(4)

related activities on an area, specified in a notice to the owner given or amended under
this section, becomes effective

amend the content of the notice that is in effect provided that the content of
the amended notice complies with the requirements of subsection (2), or

(a)


is not required for the survival of the species at risk, or
