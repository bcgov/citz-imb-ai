Antisapstain Chemical Waste

Control Regulation



[Last amended July 8, 2004 by B.C. Reg. 321/2004]









Interpretation





1



(1)


In this regulation:



"antisapstain chemical"

means chlorophenol, 2-(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole (TCMTB), copper-8-quinolinolate (Cu-8), 3-iodo-2-propynyl butyl carbamate (IPBC) and didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC);



"chlorophenol"

means the sum of chlorophenols plus chlorophenates as reported by a laboratory testing method approved by a director;



"curb"

means a raised edge or curbing which would confine all liquids dropping within the enclosure formed by it and the surface on which it sits;



"effluent"

includes precipitation runoff;



"fixed roof"

means a roof which is designed and constructed to
prevent the entry of precipitation and to be a maintenance free structure for a period of not less than 10 years, but does not include a structure which utilizes tarpaulins or similar materials;



"impervious"

means not allowing entrance or passage of antisapstain chemicals;



"isolated"

means set apart from other operations in an
enclosure away from any high traffic areas that can, under normal circumstances, prevent
the entry of unauthorized persons.






(2)


For the purposes of this regulation effluent is toxic if the effluent at 100% concentration kills 50% or more of rainbow trout within 96 hours when tested in accordance with procedures approved by a director.
