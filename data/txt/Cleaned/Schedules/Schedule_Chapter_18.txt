CHAPTER 18

CAPITAL TRANSFER AND NEGOTIATION LOAN REPAYMENT




CAPITAL TRANSFER



1. Subject to clause 4, the Capital Transfer from Canada to Tsawwassen
First Nation, including the following funds:


a. the Economic Development Capital Fund referred to in clause 107 of
the Lands chapter;


b. the Forest Resources Fund referred to in clause 6 of the Forest
Resources chapter;


c. the Commercial Fish Fund referred to in subclause 105.a of the
Fisheries chapter;


d. the Commercial Crab Fund referred to in subclause 105.b of the
Fisheries chapter;


e. the Wildlife Fund referred to in clause 9 of the Wildlife chapter;
and


f. the Reconciliation Fund referred to in clause 30 of the Lands
chapter,


will be paid in accordance with the Capital Transfer Payment Plan in
Schedule 1.


2. The value in 2006 of the Capital Transfer referred to in clause 1 is
approximately $13.9 million.




NEGOTIATION LOAN REPAYMENT



3. Subject to clause 5, Tsawwassen First Nation will make negotiation
loan repayments to Canada in accordance with the Negotiation Loan
Repayment Plan in Schedule 2.


4. Canada may set off and deduct from a payment made under clause 1, the
amount of a negotiation loan repayment to be made under clause 3 on the
same date, except to the extent that the negotiation loan repayment
amount has been prepaid in accordance with clause 5.




PREPAYMENTS



5. In addition to any negotiation loan repayment amount required under
clause 3, Tsawwassen First Nation may make loan prepayments to Canada.
All prepayments will be applied to the outstanding scheduled negotiation
loan repayment amounts in consecutive order from the Effective Date.
Tsawwassen First Nation will notify Canada in writing of a prepayment at
least 30 days before the date of that prepayment.


6. The "n" anniversary for which a prepayment is to be applied will be
the earliest anniversary for which a scheduled negotiation loan
repayment amount, or a portion thereof, remains outstanding. Any loan
prepayment applied to an outstanding negotiation loan repayment amount,
or to a portion thereof, will be credited at its future value, as of the
"n" anniversary, determined in accordance with the following formula:

Future Value = Prepayment * (1+C)K * (1+C*H/365)
where,
"/" means divided by;
"*" means multiplied by;

"K" is the number of complete years between the date of the prepayment
and the "n" anniversary;


"H" is one plus the number of days remaining in the period between the
date of the prepayment and the "n" anniversary, once the number of
complete years referred to in "K" above has been deducted, and

"C" is 4.545 per cent per year.

7. If the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding amount
of the negotiation loan repayment amount scheduled for the "n"
anniversary, the excess will be deemed to be a prepayment made on the
"n" anniversary so that the future value of the excess will be applied
as of the next anniversary in a manner analogous to that described in
this clause.


8. On receipt of a prepayment, Canada will issue a letter to Tsawwassen
First Nation setting out the amount of the prepayment received and the
manner in which it will be applied.

Notes for Finalizing Schedule 1



These notes will not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these
notes is to enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the
amounts to be shown in the final version of this Schedule. The
Provisional Payment Amounts are expressed in second quarter 2006
dollars.


These instructions will be deleted, and will no longer form part of this
Agreement, when this Schedule is completed in accordance with these
instructions and the Effective Date occurs.

1. In these notes:

"FDDIPI" means the Final Domestic Demand Implicit Price Index for
Canada, series D100466, published regularly by Statistics Canada in
Matrix 10512: Implicit Price Indexes, Gross Domestic Product, or its
replacement series as specified by Statistics Canada;


"Revision Date" means the date 30 days before the Effective Date, or
another date if the Parties agree;


"Signing Date" means the date on which this Agreement is signed by the
Parties;


"Transition Date" is the date that is 15 months after the Signing Date.


2. If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is less
than 15 months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment amount in
the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be adjusted as follows:

provisional payment amount * M/L
where,
"/" means divided by;
"*" means multiplied by;

"L" is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2006 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time that the values used in M are
published; and


"M" is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar
quarter for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the
Revision Date.


3. If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is
greater than 15 months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment
amount in the Capital Transfer Payment Plan will be adjusted as follows:


provisional payment amount * [(P/Q) * (1 + CR)Y * (1+CR*D/365)]

where:

"Q" is the value of FDDIPI for the first quarter of 2006 published by
Statistics Canada at the same time that the values used in P are
published;


"P" is the first published value of FDDIPI for the latest calendar
quarter for which Statistics Canada has published a FDDIPI before the
Transition Date;


"Y" means the number of complete years between the Transition Date and
the Effective Date;


"D" is the number of days remaining in the period between the Transition
Date and the Effective Date, after deducting the complete years in that
period that have been taken into account in the determination of Y; and

"CR" is 4.545 per cent.

The purpose of applying clause 3 is to limit the period for which the
Capital Transfer is adjusted by FDDIPI to the period that ends on the
date that is 15 months after the Signing Date, and to lengthen the
period for which the Capital Transfer is adjusted by the calculation
rate to the period between the date that is 15 months after the Signing
Date and the Effective Date.


4. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in
accordance with either clause 2 or 3 of these notes, the Capital
Transfer Payment Plan will be amended to incorporate the adjusted
figures and the headings in the Capital Transfer Payment Plan above will
be replaced by the following headings:

Notes for Finalizing Schedule 2



These notes will not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these
notes is to enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the
amounts to be shown in the final version of this Schedule.


The provisional loan repayment amounts are based on total outstanding
negotiation loans and interest accrued as of March 31, 2006. Final loan
repayment amounts, including any further negotiation loans made and
interest accrued after March 31, 2006, will be calculated and included
in the final loan repayment schedule in accordance with the following
notes.

1. In these notes:

"Revision Date"
is the same as the Revision Date in Schedule 1.


2. On the Revision Date, the provisional negotiation loan repayment
amounts in the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan will be adjusted to final
negotiation loan repayment amounts by:


a. determining the amount of the additional negotiation loans made by
Canada to Tsawwassen First Nation which were not included in the
calculation of the provisional negotiation loan repayment amounts and
any additional interest accrued since the provisional negotiation loan
and interest amounts were calculated; and


b. pro-rating and adjusting the additional amounts determined in
accordance with subclause 2.a of these notes for Tsawwassen First Nation
and apply these amounts to the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan such that
the amounts in the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan are
proportional to the amounts in the provisional Negotiation Loan
Repayment Plan and such that the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan
incorporates interest on unpaid loan balances, using 4.545% as an
interest rate per year beginning at the Effective Date and compounded
annually, which is the same rate of interest that was used to establish
the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan.


3. Canada will calculate the final negotiation loan repayment amounts
based on a document that Canada and Tsawwassen First Nation will produce
jointly before the Revision Date setting out the final negotiation loan
and interest amounts and the relevant terms and conditions of the loans
as at the Effective Date.


4. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in
accordance with clause 2 of these notes, the Negotiation Loan Repayment
Plan will be amended to incorporate the adjusted figures and the
headings in the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan will be replaced by the
following headings:
