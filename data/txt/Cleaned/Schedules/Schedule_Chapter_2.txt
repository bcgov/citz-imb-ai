APPLICATION AND RELATIONSHIP OF FEDERAL LAW, PROVINCIAL LAW AND TSAWWASSEN LAW



19. Federal Law, Provincial Law and Tsawwassen Law applies to Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Lands, Tsawwassen Government, Tsawwassen Public Institutions and Tsawwassen Corporations.


20. Canada will recommend to Parliament that Federal Settlement Legislation include a provision that, to the extent that a Provincial Law does not apply of its own force to Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Lands, Tsawwassen Government, Tsawwassen Public Institutions or Tsawwassen Corporations, that law of British Columbia will, subject to the Federal Settlement Legislation and any other act of Parliament, apply in accordance with this Agreement to Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Lands, Tsawwassen Government, Tsawwassen Public Institutions and Tsawwassen Corporations, as the case may be.


21. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Tsawwassen Law does not apply to Canada or British Columbia.


22. For greater certainty, the powers of Tsawwassen Government to make laws, set out in this Agreement, do not include the power to make laws in respect of criminal law, criminal procedure, Intellectual Property, the official languages of Canada, aeronautics, navigation and shipping, or labour relations and working conditions.


23. Despite any other rule of priority in this Agreement, a Federal Law in relation to peace, order and good government, criminal law, human rights, the protection of the health and safety of all Canadians, or other matters of overriding national importance, prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law.


24. Despite any other rule of priority in this Agreement, Federal and Provincial Law prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law that has an incidental impact on a subject matter for which Tsawwassen Government:


a. has no power to make laws; or


b. has the power to make laws but in respect of which Federal and Provincial Laws prevail in the event of a Conflict.


25. Despite any other rule of priority in this Agreement, Federal and Provincial Law prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law that has a double aspect with any federal or provincial legislative jurisdiction for which Tsawwassen Government:


a. has no power to make laws; or


b. has the power to make laws but in respect of which Federal and Provincial Laws prevail in the event of a Conflict.





RELATIONSHIP OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FEDERAL LAW, PROVINCIAL LAW AND TSAWWASSEN LAW



26. Any Tsawwassen Law that is inconsistent with this Agreement is of no force or effect to the extent of the inconsistency.


27. This Agreement prevails to the extent of an inconsistency with a Federal or Provincial Law.


28. Federal Settlement Legislation prevails over other Federal Law to the extent of a Conflict, and Provincial Settlement Legislation prevails over other Provincial Law to the extent of a Conflict.


29. A licence, permit or other authorization, to be issued by Canada or British Columbia as a result of this Agreement, will be issued under Federal or Provincial Law, as the case may be, and will not form part of this Agreement, and this Agreement prevails to the extent of any inconsistency with the licence, permit or other authorization.





INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS



30. After the Effective Date, before consenting to be bound by a new International Treaty that would give rise to a new International Legal Obligation that may adversely affect a right of Tsawwassen First Nation under this Agreement, Canada will Consult with Tsawwassen First Nation in respect of the International Treaty, either separately or through a forum that Canada determines is appropriate.


31. Where Canada informs Tsawwassen First Nation that it considers that a Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen First Nation causes Canada to be unable to perform an International Legal Obligation, Tsawwassen First Nation and Canada will discuss remedial measures to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation. Subject to clause 32, Tsawwassen First Nation will remedy the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power to the extent necessary to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation.


32. Where Canada and Tsawwassen First Nation disagree over whether a Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen First Nation causes Canada to be unable to perform an International Legal Obligation, the dispute will be resolved under the Dispute Resolution chapter of this Agreement, including the arbitration provisions, and:


a. if the arbitrator, having taken into account all relevant considerations, including any reservations and exceptions taken by Canada, determines that the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen First Nation does not cause Canada to be unable to perform the International Legal Obligation, or that the remedial measures are sufficient to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation, Canada will not take any further action for this reason aimed at changing the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power; or


b. if the arbitrator, having taken into account all relevant considerations including any reservations and exceptions available to Canada, determines that the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power causes Canada to be unable to perform the International Legal Obligation, or that the remedial measures are insufficient to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation, Tsawwassen First Nation will remedy the Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power to the extent necessary to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation.


33. Canada will Consult with Tsawwassen First Nation in respect of the development of positions taken by Canada before an International Tribunal where a Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen First Nation has given rise to an issue concerning the performance of an International Legal Obligation of Canada. Canada's positions before the International Tribunal will take into account the commitment of the Parties to the integrity of this Agreement.


34. Despite clause 32, if there is a finding of an International Tribunal of non-performance of an International Legal Obligation of Canada attributable to a Tsawwassen Law or other exercise of power by Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen First Nation will, at the request of Canada, remedy the Tsawwassen Law or action to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation consistent with the compliance of Canada, including Federal or Provincial Law, as applicable, in respect of that International Legal Obligation.





OTHER RIGHTS, BENEFITS AND PROGRAMS



35. Tsawwassen Members who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada continue to be entitled to all the rights and benefits of other Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada applicable to them from time to time.


36. Subject to clause 37, nothing in this Agreement affects the ability of Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Government, Tsawwassen Public Institutions or Tsawwassen Corporations to participate in or benefit from federal or provincial programs for registered Indians, other Indians or aboriginal people in accordance with criteria in effect from time to time.


37. Tsawwassen Members are eligible to participate in programs established by Canada or British Columbia and to receive public services from Canada or British Columbia, in accordance with general criteria established for those programs or public services from time to time, to the extent that the Tsawwassen First Nation has not assumed responsibility for those programs or public services under a Fiscal Financing Agreement or other funding agreement.


38. Nothing in this Agreement affects the ability of Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Government, Tsawwassen Public Institutions or Tsawwassen Corporations to apply for or bid on any commercial, economic or other activity or project for which they would otherwise be eligible.


39. Subject to the Transition chapter and clause 16 of the Taxation chapter, the

Indian Act

has no application to Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Government or Tsawwassen Public Institutions, except for the purpose of determining whether an individual is an "Indian" within the meaning of the

Indian Act

.


40. Subject to clause 5 of the Transition chapter, the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management, the

First Nations Land Management Act

and the Tsawwassen First Nation Land Code have no application to Tsawwassen First Nation, Tsawwassen Members, Tsawwassen Lands, Tsawwassen Government or Tsawwassen Public Institutions.


41. For so long as the

First Nations Land Management Act

is in force, Canada will indemnify Tsawwassen First Nation, in respect of lands that immediately before the Effective Date comprised the Former Tsawwassen Reserve, in the same manner and under the same conditions as would be the case if the

First Nations Land Management Act

applied to those lands.





JUDICIAL DETERMINATIONS IN RESPECT OF VALIDITY



42. If a superior court of a province, the Federal Court of Canada or the Supreme Court of Canada finally determines any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or unenforceable:

d. as may be required under the common law in relation to an infringement of that right.


46. For greater certainty, the exercise of a power or authority, or an action taken, by Canada or British Columbia that is consistent with or in accordance with this Agreement is not an infringement of the Section 35 Rights of Tsawwassen First Nation and will not be subject to any obligation to consult except as set out in subclause 45.a, 45.b or 45.c.





OTHER ABORIGINAL PEOPLE



47. Nothing in this Agreement affects, recognizes or provides any rights under section 35 of the

for any aboriginal people other than Tsawwassen First Nation.


48. If a superior court of a province, the Federal Court of Canada or the Supreme Court of Canada finally determines that any aboriginal people, other than Tsawwassen First Nation, have rights under section 35 of the

Constitution Act, 1982

that are adversely affected by a provision of this Agreement:


a. the provision will operate and have effect to the extent that it does not adversely affect those rights; and


b. if the provision cannot operate and have effect in a way that it does not adversely affect those rights, the Parties will make best efforts to amend this Agreement to remedy or replace the provision.


49. If Canada or British Columbia enters into a treaty or a land claims agreement within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 of the

with any other aboriginal people and that treaty or land claims agreement adversely affects the Section 35 Rights of Tsawwassen First Nation as set out in this Agreement:
