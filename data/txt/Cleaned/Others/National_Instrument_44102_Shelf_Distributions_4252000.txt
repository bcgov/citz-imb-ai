However, purchasers of

[describe securities]

distributed under an at-the-market distribution by

[name of issuer]

[describe securities]

and do not have remedies of rescission or, in some jurisdictions, revisions of the price, or damages for non-delivery of the prospectus, prospectus supplement, and any amendment relating to

[describe securities]

purchased by such purchaser will not be sent or delivered, as permitted under Part 9 of National Instrument 44-102 Shelf Distributions.


Securities legislation in some provinces and territories of Canada further provides purchasers with remedies for rescission or, in some jurisdictions, revisions of the price or damages if the prospectus, prospectus supplement, and any amendment relating to securities purchased by a purchaser contains a misrepresentation. Those remedies must be exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by securities legislation. Any remedies under securities legislation that a purchaser of

[describe securities]

distributed under an at-the-market distribution by

[name of issuer]

may have against

[name of issuer]

or its agents for rescission or, in some jurisdictions, revisions of the price, or damages if the prospectus, prospectus supplement, and any amendment relating to securities purchased by a purchaser contain a misrepresentation will remain unaffected by the non-delivery of the prospectus referred to above.


A purchaser should refer to applicable securities legislation for the particulars of these rights and should consult a legal adviser."






(i)


if there has been a statement of a purchaser's rights contained in a previous version of the ATM prospectus, the issuer discloses in the current ATM prospectus a statement to the effect that, solely with regard to the at-the-market distribution, the statement of rights required to be included in the ATM prospectus, under paragraph (h), supersedes the previous statement;

(k)


the ATM prospectus includes the certificates required under Part 5 of NI 41-101, or other securities legislation in the form required under section 9.5 or 9.6 of this Instrument, as applicable;
