A decision of the Supreme Court under subsection (4) may not be appealed.

An arbitral tribunal must






(a)


treat each party fairly,

(a)


an arbitration agreement which forms part of a contract must be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract, and






(b)


a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void must not entail, as a matter of law, the invalidity of the arbitration agreement.






(2)


A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction must be raised not later than the submission of the first response on the substance of the dispute.






(3)


A party to arbitral proceedings is not precluded from raising a plea referred to in subsection (2) by the fact that the party appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.
