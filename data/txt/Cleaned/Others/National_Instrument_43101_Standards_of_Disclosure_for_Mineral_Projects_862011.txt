states the grade or quality and the quantity for each category of the mineral resources and mineral reserves if the quantity of contained metal or mineral is included in the disclosure.








Restricted disclosure





2.3



(1)


An issuer must not disclose






(a)


the quantity, grade, or metal or mineral content of a deposit that has not been categorized as an inferred mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource, a measured mineral resource, a probable mineral reserve or a proven mineral reserve;

Despite paragraph (1) (b), an issuer may disclose the results of a preliminary economic assessment that includes or is based on inferred mineral resources if the disclosure






(a)


states with equal prominence that the preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized;






(b)


states the basis for the preliminary economic assessment and any qualifications and assumptions made by the qualified person; and






(c)


describes the impact of the preliminary economic assessment on the results of any pre-feasibility or feasibility study in respect of the subject property.

includes any more recent estimates or data available to the issuer;






(f)


comments on what work needs to be done to upgrade or verify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves; and

a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves; and






(ii)


the issuer is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.

INSTRUCTIONS:




(1) The objective of the technical report is to provide a summary of material scientific and technical information concerning mineral exploration, development, and production activities on a mineral property that is material to an issuer. This Form sets out the requirements for the preparation and content of a technical report.




(2) Terms used in this Form that are defined or interpreted in National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the "Instrument") will have that definition or interpretation. In addition, a general definition instrument has been adopted as National Instrument 14-101 Definitions that contains definitions of certain terms used in more than one national instrument. Readers of this Form should review both these national instruments for defined terms.




(3) The qualified person preparing the technical report should keep in mind that the intended audience is the investing public and their advisors who, in most cases, will not be mining experts. Therefore, to the extent possible, technical reports should be simplified and understandable to a reasonable investor. However, the technical report should include sufficient context and cautionary language to allow a reasonable investor to understand the nature, importance, and limitations of the data, interpretations and conclusions summarized in the technical report.




(4) The qualified person preparing the technical report must use all of the headings of Items 1 to 14 and 23 to 27 in this Form and provide the information specified under each heading. For advanced properties, the qualified person must also use the headings of Items 15 to 22 and include the information required under each of these headings. The qualified person may create sub-headings. Disclosure included under one heading is not required to be repeated under another heading.




(5) The qualified person preparing the technical report may refer to information in a technical report previously filed by the issuer for the subject property if the information is still current and the technical report identifies the title, date and author of the previously filed technical report. However, the qualified person must still summarize or quote the referenced information in the current technical report and may not disclaim responsibility for the referenced information. Except as permitted by subsection 4.2 (3) of the Instrument, an issuer may not update or revise a previously filed technical report by filing an addendum.




(6) While the Form mandates the headings and general format of the technical report, the qualified person preparing the technical report is responsible for determining the level of detail required under each Item based on the qualified person's assessment of the relevance and significance of the information.




(7) The technical report may only contain disclaimers that are in accordance with section 6.4 of the Instrument and Item 3 of this Form.




(8) Since a technical report is a summary document the inclusion and filing of comprehensive appendices is not generally necessary to comply with the requirements of the Form.




(9) The Instrument requires certificates and consents of qualified persons, prepared in accordance with sections 8.1 and 8.3 respectively, to be filed at the same time as the technical report. The Instrument does not specifically require the issuer to file the certificate of qualified person as a separate document. It is generally acceptable for the qualified person to include the certificate in the technical report and to use the certificate as the date and signature page.




Contents of the Technical Report




Title page

— Include a title page setting out the title of the technical report, the general location of the mineral project, the name and professional designation of each qualified person and the effective date of the technical report.



Date and signature page

— The technical report must have a signature page, at either the beginning or end of the technical report, signed in accordance with section 5.2 of the Instrument. The effective date of the technical report and date of signing must be on the signature page.



Table of contents

— Provide a table of contents listing the contents of the technical report, including figures and tables.



Illustrations

— Technical reports must be illustrated by legible maps, plans and sections, all prepared at an appropriate scale to distinguish important features. Maps must be dated and include a legend, author or information source, a scale in bar or grid form, and an arrow indicating north. All technical reports must be accompanied by a location or index map and a compilation map outlining the general geology of the property. In addition, all technical reports must include more detailed maps showing all important features described in the text, relative to the property boundaries, including but not limited to


(a) for exploration projects, areas of previous or historical exploration, and the location of known mineralization, geochemical or geophysical anomalies, drilling, and mineral deposits;


(b) for advanced properties other than properties under development or in production, the location and surficial outline of mineral resources, mineral reserves and, to the extent known, areas for potential access and infrastructure; and


(c) for properties under development or in production, the location of pit limits or underground development, plant sites, tailings storage areas, waste disposal areas and all other significant infrastructure features.


If information is used from other sources in preparing maps, drawings, or diagrams, disclose the source of the information. If adjacent or nearby properties have an important bearing on the potential of the subject property, the location of the properties and any relevant mineralized structures discussed in the report must be shown in relationship to the subject property.



INSTRUCTION:




Summarize and simplify the illustrations so that they are legible and suitable for electronic filing. For ease of reference, consider inserting the illustrations in the text of the report in relative proximity to the text they illustrate.

INSTRUCTION:




In some specific cases, the qualified person may not be in a position to make meaningful recommendations for further work.
