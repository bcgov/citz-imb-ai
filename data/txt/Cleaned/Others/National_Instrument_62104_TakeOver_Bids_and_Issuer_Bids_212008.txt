In this Instrument, in determining the beneficial ownership of
securities of an offeror, of an acquiror or of any person acting
jointly or in concert with the offeror or the acquiror, at any given
date, the offeror, the acquiror or the person is deemed to have
acquired and to be the beneficial owner of a security, including an

(4)

In this section, an offeror is not a beneficial owner of securities
solely because there is an agreement, commitment or understanding that
a security holder will tender the securities under a take-over bid or
an issuer bid, made by the offeror, that is not exempt from Part 2.

In Québec, for the purposes of this Instrument, a person that

without limiting the generality of the foregoing,




(a)

the following are deemed to be acting jointly or in concert with an
offeror or an acquiror:




(i)

a person that, as a result of any agreement, commitment or
understanding with the offeror, the acquiror or with any other person
acting jointly or in concert with the offeror or the acquiror,
acquires or offers to acquire securities of the same class as those
subject to the offer to acquire;

an affiliate of the offeror or the acquiror;




(b)

the following are presumed to be acting jointly or in concert with an
offeror or an acquiror:

understanding with the offeror, the acquiror or with any other person
acting jointly or in concert with the offeror or the acquiror, intends
to exercise jointly or in concert with the offeror, the acquiror or
with any person acting jointly or in concert with the offeror or the
acquiror any voting rights attaching to any securities of the offeree
issuer;




(ii)

an associate of the offeror or the acquiror.




(2)

Subsection (1) does not apply to a registered dealer acting solely in
an agency capacity for the offeror in connection with a bid and not
executing principal transactions in the class of securities subject to
the offer to acquire or performing services beyond the customary
functions of a registered dealer.




(3)

For the purposes of this section, a person is not acting jointly or in
concert with an offeror solely because there is an agreement,
commitment or understanding that the person will tender securities
under a take-over bid or an issuer bid, made by the offeror, that is
not exempt from Part 2.

[am. B.C. Reg. 106/2016, Sch. B, s. 5.]





Application to direct and indirect offers




1.10


In this Instrument, a reference to an offer to acquire or to the
acquisition or ownership of securities or to control or direction over
securities includes a direct or indirect offer to acquire or the
direct or indirect acquisition or ownership of securities, or the
direct or indirect control or direction over securities, as the case
may be.






Determination of market price




1.11

(1)


In this Instrument,




(a)

the market price of a class of securities for which there is a
published market, at any date, is an amount equal to the simple
average of the closing price of securities of that class for each of
the business days on which there was a closing price in the 20
business days preceding that date,




(b)

if a published market does not provide a closing price, but provides
only the highest and lowest prices of securities traded on a
particular day, the market price of the securities, at any date, is an
amount equal to the average of the simple averages of the highest and
lowest prices for each of the business days on which there were
highest and lowest prices in the 20 business days preceding that date,
and




(c)

if there has been trading of securities in a published market for
fewer than 10 of the 20 business days preceding the date as of which
the market price of the securities is being determined, the market
price is the average of the following prices established for each day
of the 20 business days preceding that date:




(i)

the average of the closing bid and ask prices for each day on which
there was no trading; and




(ii)

either the closing price of securities of the class for each day that
there has been trading, if the published market provides a closing
price, or the average of the highest and lowest prices of securities
of that class for each day that there has been trading, if the
published market provides only the highest and lowest prices of
securities traded on a particular day.




(2)

If there is more than one published market for a security, the market
price in paragraphs (1) (a), (b) and (c) must be determined as
follows:




(a)

if only one of the published markets is in Canada, the market price
must be determined solely by reference to that market;




(b)

if there is more than one published market in Canada, the market price
must be determined solely by reference to the published market in
Canada on which the greatest volume of trading in the particular class
of securities occurred during the 20 business days preceding the date
as of which the market price is being determined;




(c)

if there is no published market in Canada, the market price must be
determined solely by reference to the published market on which the
greatest volume of trading in the particular class of securities
occurred during the 20 business days preceding the date as of which
the market price is being determined.




(3)

Despite subsections (1) and (2) for the purposes of section 4.1 and
subsection 4.8 (3), if an offeror acquires securities on a published
market, the market price for those securities is the price of the last
standard trading unit of securities of that class purchased, before
the acquisition by the offeror, by a person who was not acting jointly
or in concert with the offeror.

a benefit not described in paragraph (a) that is received solely in
connection with the security holder's services as an employee,
director or consultant of the offeree issuer, of an affiliated entity
of the offeree issuer, or of a successor to the business of the

the benefit is not conferred for the purpose, in whole or in part, of
increasing the amount of the consideration paid to the security holder
for securities deposited under the bid or providing an incentive to

circular or directors' circular.

the security holder; and

(b) (ii) is disclosed in the issuer bid circular or, in the case of a

permitting or requiring the security holder or any person acting
jointly or in concert with the security holder, whether or not on

a particular class within 60 days by a single transaction or a series
of linked transactions is deemed to be a security of a particular
class.






Proportionate take up and payment

the bid, the offeror must take up and pay for the securities
proportionately, disregarding fractions, according to the number of
securities deposited by each security holder.




(2)

Subsection (1) does not prohibit an offeror from acquiring securities
under the terms of an issuer bid that, if not acquired, would
constitute less than a standard trading unit for the security holder.




(3)

Subsection (1) does not apply to securities deposited under the terms
of an issuer bid by security holders who




(a)

are entitled to elect a minimum price per security, within a range of

elect a minimum price which is higher than the price that the offeror
pays for securities under the bid.

bid to ensure that the required funds are available to make full
payment for the securities that the offeror has offered to acquire.




(2)

The financing arrangements required to be made under subsection (1)
may be subject to conditions if, at the time the take-over bid or the
issuer bid is commenced, the offeror reasonably believes the
possibility to be remote that, if the conditions of the bid are
satisfied or waived, the offeror will be unable to pay for the
securities deposited under the bid due to a financing condition not
being satisfied.
