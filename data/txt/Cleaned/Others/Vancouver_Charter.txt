provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any resolution
providing for the same. For the purposes of this section, the word

Except as provided in subsection (2.1), if the Council decides to
dispose of a street that




(a)

has been stopped up, altered or diverted, whether opened, maintained
or improved by the city or not,


the disposal price must be established by the Council and the owner of
the abutting real property has the right to purchase the street at
that price for a period of time set by the Council.




(2.1)

Subsection (2) does not apply if the owner of the abutting real
property has given the city a waiver of that owner's right to
purchase.




(3)

Where there is more than one abutting owner, each shall have the right
to purchase so much of the real property comprising such street or
portion of street so stopped up as the Council may decide, and the
price fixed by Council aforesaid shall be apportioned between the
parcels to be disposed of accordingly.




(4)

If an owner does not exercise the owner's right to purchase within
such period as may be fixed by the resolution or any subsequent
resolution, the Council may dispose of the part which the owner has
the right to purchase to any other person at the same or greater
price.




(5)

Where the real property of an owner abutting a street stopped up by
resolution also abuts any other street which the Council desires to
widen, alter, or divert and requires for that purpose a portion of the
real property aforesaid, the Council may, notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (2) and (3) hereof, exchange therefor so
much of the real property comprising the street so stopped up for the
real property so required as aforesaid as may be mutually agreed upon
with such owner.




(6)

If an owner of an abutting real property acquires a portion of a
street under this section or otherwise, the Council may direct that
the owner, as a condition of the disposal, consolidate the portion
acquired with the abutting real property.




(7)

Upon the deposit in the land title office of a copy of the resolution
stopping up, altering, or diverting any street or part thereof,
certified as such by the City Clerk, accompanied by a plan showing
thereon the street or part thereof so stopped up, altered, or

or section 289 (2) of this Act or the provisions of any other Act, and
whether the city appears on the records of the land title office as
the owner or not, on finding a good, safeholding marketable title in
fee-simple in the applicant, register the real property described in
the said conveyance in the name of the grantee therein and issue to
the grantee a certificate of indefeasible title thereto. Any
conveyance executed under this section shall have effect as a Crown
grant.




(8)

Where the city is the owner of any real property abutting the street
or portion thereof stopped up, diverted, or altered by the Council
pursuant to this Act, the provisions of this section shall, mutatis
mutandis, apply to the city as such owner or applicant, but in any
such case it shall not be necessary for the city as the applicant to
deposit in the land title office the conveyance referred to in
subsection (7) hereof, and the Registrar aforesaid shall forthwith
register the real property in the name of the city.

requiring that a proposed subdivision

(e)

requiring that a water-distribution system, a sanitary
sewage-collection system, or storm-water collection system or a
combined sewage-collection system, or any of them, be provided in
accordance with standards set out in the by-law, and requiring that
provision be made for the connection of such systems with the
established systems of the city, but if the city requires that any
mains of such systems be of a diameter in excess of that required to
service the subdivision, the city shall assume and pay the cost of
providing the excess capacity;




(f)

requiring that all power-lines, telephone-lines, or any other wires or
cables shall be installed underground. The by-law may provide that the
Council shall have power to waive this requirement where the applicant
for the subdivision would be put to an unreasonable expense;




(g)

for providing that




(i)

upon any subdivision of a parcel of land exceeding twenty acres there
shall be conveyed to the city, without compensation, a portion of such
land for park or recreation purposes other than streets, such portion
not to exceed ten per centum of the land included in the subdivision;




(ii)

the size, dimensions, and location of the portion of the land to be
conveyed to the city shall be determined by the approving officer;




(iii)

the Council may accept in lieu of the conveyance to the city of the
lands to which it is entitled hereunder, or any portion thereof, the
payment of a sum of money equivalent to the actual value of such land
or portion thereof immediately prior to the subdivision;




(iv)

the conveyance to the city of the lands to which it is entitled
hereunder shall contain a provision that such lands may be sold,
leased, or otherwise alienated by the Council after the expiration of
three years from the date of the conveyance;




(v)

a further subdivision of the lands included in a subdivision, a
portion of which has been conveyed to the city for the purposes
aforesaid, shall not be subject to the provisions of a by-law passed
pursuant to clause (g);




(vi)

all moneys received by the city pursuant to the provisions of clauses
(iii) and (iv) shall be held in trust and used only for the purpose of
providing public park or recreation facilities;




(h)

establishing and imposing subdivision application fees payable to the
city, which may vary according to the size of the property to be
subdivided, the number of lots to be created and the type or
classification of the property;




(i)

establishing and imposing fees payable to the city for changes to a
subdivision plan or a by-law under this section.




(1.1)

A fee under subsection (1) (h) or (i) must not exceed the estimated
average costs of processing, inspection, advertising and
administration that are usually related to the type of application to
which the fee relates.




(2)

The owner of land being subdivided shall provide, without
compensation, land for streets in accordance with a by-law under
subsection (1).




(3)

The approving officer may refuse to approve a subdivision plan if the
approving officer is of the opinion that the cost to the city of
providing or maintaining public utilities or other municipal works or
services would be excessive.




(4)

Where any provision of, or made under, the

Land Title Act

or any other Act with respect to the subdivision or resubdivision of
real property, or the approval, acceptance, or refusal thereof, is
inconsistent with any provision of a by-law passed pursuant to this
section, the provision of the by-law shall prevail.




(5)

Where, as a result of an expropriation that occurs after this section
comes into force, a parcel of land that could have been subdivided
into 2 or more parcels under a by-law in effect when the land
expropriated was vested in the expropriating authority can no longer
be subdivided into the same number of parcels, the parcel shall be
deemed to conform to the applicable by-law for the purposes of the
subdivision as though the expropriation had not occurred, but only to
the extent that none of the parcels that would be created by the
subdivision would be less than 90% of the area that would otherwise be
permitted by the applicable by-law.




(6)

Subsection (5) does not apply where the owner of the parcel being
subdivided has received compensation that is directly attributable to
the reduction in the market value of the land that results from the
inability to subdivide the parcel in the manner that would have been
permitted under the applicable by-law.

months from and after the date on which such damage was sustained;
provided that in case of the death of a person injured the want of a

sustained by reason of any obstruction, excavation, or opening, or
covering, or overhead structure, in or near to or over a street,
placed, made, left, or maintained by any person, other than a servant
or agent of the city, or to recover damages sustained by reason of any
negligent or wrongful act or omission of or failure to comply with the
provisions of any Statute or by-law of the city, or any contract,
covenant, or agreement by any person, other than a servant or agent of
the city, the city shall have a remedy over against such person, and

which the plaintiff in the action may recover against the city.

1953-55-295.





Third-party procedure




296.


The city shall be entitled to such remedy over in the same action if

damages were sustained by reason of an obstruction, excavation, or
opening in or near to a street so placed, made, left, or maintained by
the other person, or by reason of any negligent or wrongful act or
omission of any person, other than a servant of the city; and the city
may in such action have the other person added as a party defendant or
third party for the purposes hereof (if not already a defendant in the
action jointly with the city); and the other person may defend such
action as well against the plaintiff's claim as against the claim of
the city to a remedy over; and the Court or Judge, upon the trial of
the action, may order costs to be paid by or to any of the parties
thereto, or in respect of any claims set up therein, as in other
cases.

not added as a party defendant or third party, or if the city has paid
the claim for such damages before any action is brought to recover the
same, of before any recovery of damages or costs against the city
therein, the city shall have a remedy over by action against such
other person for such damages and costs as have been sustained by
reason of any obstruction, excavation, or opening placed, made, left,
or maintained by such other person.

1953-55-297.





When validity of judgment applies




298.


Such other person shall be deemed to admit the validity of the
judgment, if any, obtained against the city in cases only where a
notice has been served on such other person pursuant to the provisions
of the Rules of Court in that behalf, or where such other person has
admitted or is estopped from denying the validity of such judgment.

1953-55-298.





Condition of recovery

admission or estoppel, and the other person has not been made a party
defendant or third party to the action against the city, or where such
damages have been paid without action or without recovery of judgment
against the city, the liability of the city for such damages, and the
fact that the damages were sustained by reason of an obstruction,
excavation, or opening placed, made, left, or maintained by the other
person, must be established in the action against such other person to
entitle the city to recover in such action.

to pay all debts and obligations of the city falling due within the
year that are not otherwise provided for.




(3)

Before adopting the rating by-law, the Council must consider the rates
of levy proposed for each property class in conjunction with the
objectives and policies set out in the report under section 219 (2)

Assessment averaging and phasing in by-laws




374.4

(1)


Subject to subsection (1.1), instead of levying rates on the assessed
value of land and improvements, the Council may, by by-law, levy the
rates under subsection (2) or (3).




(1.1)

Subsection (1) does not apply to a rate levied by the Council to
collect a tax imposed by the Province under section 120.1 of the

School Act

.




(2)

For an assessment averaging option, rates may be imposed on the amount
determined in accordance with the following formula:






Amount = averaged land value + assessed improvements value








where


averaged land value
=

the average of the assessed value of the land in



(a)
the current year, and


(b)

the number of preceding years established by by-law under
subsection (12);



assessed improvements value

determined in accordance with the following formula:






Amount = (assessed land value − phasing reduction) + assessed
improvements value








where


assessed land value
=

the assessed value of the land in the current year;



phasing reduction
=

the phasing percentage established by the bylaw, being not less
than 50% and not more than 66%, of the difference between

the increase in the assessed value of the land in the current
year from the previous year, and



(b)

the assessed value of the land in the previous year multiplied
by the average percentage increase in the assessed value from
the previous year to the current year of all land within the
city included in the same property class;



assessed improvements value
=

the assessed value of improvements in the current year.

The Council shall not adopt a by-law under this section unless the
following requirements are met:




(a)

the Council complies with the requirements of any regulations under
subsection (11);




(b)

before January 1 of the year in which the by-law is to take effect,
notice of intent to consider the by-law is provided to the British

properties within the city

is published in accordance with section 3;



(d)

the by-law is adopted before March 31 in the year in which it is to

their property.




(5)

Subject to any regulation made under subsection (11), a by-law under
subsection (1) may




(a)

apply to one or more property classes, or




(b)

modify the averaging formula in subsection (2) or the phasing formula
in subsection (3) to exempt from the by-law or govern the application
of the by-law to particular types of property within a property class.




(6)

The authority under subsection (5) (b) includes authority in relation
to property with an assessed value of that is different from that on
the previous assessment roll because of one or more of the following:

Assessment Act

;




(d)

any other prescribed factor.




(7)

If the Council adopts a by-law under subsection (1), the following
rules apply:

;




(ii)

sections 119 and 137 of the

School Act

the net taxable value referred to in this or any other Act, shall be
the basis for taxing properties within the property classes specified
in the by-law to raise the money required under the provisions
referred to in paragraph (a).




(8)

If




(a)

a body other than the Council sets a rate under an enactment for
calculating property taxes, and




(b)

the Council adopts a by-law under subsection (1),


then, despite any other Act, the Council shall, by resolution,
substitute a rate that is sufficient to raise the same amount of
revenue in the city for that body from each property class to which
the by-law applies as the amount that would have been raised for that
body had that by-law not been adopted.




(9)

If the amount of revenue raised in any year for a body under
subsection (8) is more or less than the amount that would have been
raised had the Council not substituted the rate, the difference must
be used to adjust the rate for the next year.




(10)

On the initiative of the Collector of Taxes or on the request of an
owner who is notified under section 403 of adjustments to the net
taxable value of the owner's property, the Collector of Taxes may
correct errors made in applying a by-law under subsection (1) to any
property.

The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations as follows:




(a)

restricting the property classes to which a by-law under subsection
(1) may apply;




(b)

defining any term used in this section;




(c)

(d)

prescribing the information to be contained in the notice that is to
be published under subsection (4) (c);

of preceding years that are to be applied in determining the averaged
land value for the purposes of subsection (2).




(13)

For the 5 years following the adoption of a by-law under subsection
(12), the by-law may not be amended to change the number of preceding
years established by the by-law and the by-law may not be repealed.

upon the parcel as if the sale had not taken place, and that such
taxes and interest shall be deemed to be delinquent taxes, or the

Mode of recovering parcel from defaulting owner




451.

(1)


If the city as purchaser at a tax sale becomes the registered owner of
a parcel and subsequently enters into an agreement to sell such
parcel, and if the purchaser under such agreement makes default in the
payment of principal, interest, taxes, or other charges due
thereunder, the city need not bring an action to enforce its rights
but may instead, if the Council by resolution so directs, cause notice
to be given to the purchaser in writing at the address given in the
agreement referring to this section and demanding payment of the
amount in default to the city within ninety days from the giving of
the notice and warning the purchaser that upon the purchaser's failure
to remedy the default within the said ninety days, the purchaser and
those claiming under or through the purchaser will forfeit any
interest in the said parcel, together with any sums theretofore paid
to the city under the agreement. If the purchaser fails to remedy the
default within the said period of ninety days, all the right, title,
and interest of the purchaser under the agreement, and all those
claiming under or through the purchaser, shall, at the expiration of
such period, absolutely cease and determine, and the parcel shall
immediately become revested in the city, free from all claims by the
purchaser, or anyone claiming under or through the purchaser, and,
notwithstanding any Statute or rule of law or equity to the contrary,
all payments made to the city under the said agreement shall be
forfeited to the city. The city may file with the Registrar of Land
Titles a statutory declaration proving such resolution, the giving of
the notice, and the continued default, and thereupon the Registrar
shall cancel any charge or encumbrance registered against the parcel
in respect of the agreement.




(2)

Where any parcel becomes revested in the city under subsection (1),
the city may cause notice to be given to any occupant of such parcel
requiring the occupant to vacate forthwith and giving to the occupant
four weeks' notice of the city's intention to sue out a writ of
possession of such parcel in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
and unless within such four weeks the occupant vacates the parcel or
registers a certificate of pending litigation against the parcel, the
city shall, without any order for that purpose, be entitled to sue out
such writ of possession on filing with the District Registrar of the
Court an affidavit proving service of the notice and failure to
vacate.

452.


If the purchaser of a parcel at a tax sale completes a purchase by
paying to the Collector a sum in excess of the upset price, together
with the delinquent taxes and interest required of the purchaser under
section 439, the owner, or owner under agreement, at the expiration of
the period of redemption, or such other person as may be legally
entitled to it, may claim such excess from the city. To the person
establishing a claim to the satisfaction of the Collector, the city
shall pay the excess.

satisfaction of the Collector, and no action in respect thereof has
been brought against the city.

according to the frontage of the rateable property, then allowance may
be made in any assessment for corner lots, triangular or irregularly
shaped parcels of land, and parcels comprising a railway right-of-way,
having due regard to the situation, value, and superficial area of
such lots or parcels as compared with adjoining lots and parcels of
land assessable for such work, improvement, or service, and the
Council may charge the amount of any allowance made on any such lot or
parcel of land on the other rateable property in such designated area,

Where, in approving a subdivision, the city requires that the mains of
the systems referred to in section 292 (1) (e) be of a diameter in
excess of that required to service the subdivision, the cost of
providing such excess capacity shall be deemed to be a capital project
in respect of which a development cost levy may be imposed subject to

In addition to the capital projects referred to in subsections (1) and
(2), Council may impose a development cost levy for the purpose of

A by-law imposing, or amending the amount of, a development cost levy
that would otherwise be applicable to the construction, alteration or
extension of a building or structure, or part of a building or
structure, has no effect with respect to that construction, alteration

the building permit authorizing that construction, alteration or
extension is issued within 12 months of the date the by-law is
adopted, and

respect to the parcel or parcels in relation to which the building
permit was issued.

the City of Vancouver or a non-profit organization, is or will be,
after construction, alteration or extension, used for social housing
and, for the purposes of this paragraph, Council may define what

(11)

No development cost levy shall be imposed to pay for any capital

passed pursuant to section 292 or in respect of which an assessment
has been imposed pursuant to Part XXIV.




(11.1)

If an amount has been paid under section 193D (5) (d) in relation to
development of a property, that amount must be deducted from the
development cost levy in relation to the development of the property
otherwise payable under this section for Replacement Housing.




(12)

The by-law that imposes the development cost levy shall set out the
basis of the levy and the levy may vary with respect to




(a)

different zones or different defined or specified areas, and




(b)

different uses or occupancies and, for the purpose of this subsection,
Council may define what constitutes a use, occupancy or unit on such
basis as it determines to be appropriate.




(13)

The development cost levy may be based on a rate per foot on the
length of the longest boundary of the parcel with respect to which the
levy is imposed, the number of units, or the number of square feet
permitted by the building permit in the development with respect to
which the levy is imposed, or on such other basis as Council deems
appropriate having regard to anticipated development rights and their
contribution to the need for capital projects. The basis of
development cost levies may vary for different capital projects. A
development cost levy under this Part shall not be based on a
percentage of the cost of a development. A development cost levy for
any development as shown on an application for a development permit
shall not exceed 10% of the value of the development as determined
pursuant to the building by-law from time to time in force.




(14)

The development cost levy shall be calculated with reference to the
information contained on the application for a development permit or
to records contained in the Land Title Office. Where development takes
place in stages, the total development cost levy shall be apportioned
and paid as each building permit is issued. Subject to the limitation
contained in subsection (13), the portion of the levy to be paid on
the issuance of each building permit shall, until the total levy is
paid, be 10% of the value of the work authorized by the permit as
determined pursuant to the building by-law.




(15)

The Council shall, on written request, make available to any person
subject to the levy the considerations, information and calculations
used to determine the basis of a development cost levy, but any
information respecting the contemplated acquisition costs of specific
properties need not be provided.




(16)

A development cost levy shall be deposited in a separate development
cost levy reserve fund established for the purposes for which it was
levied.




(17)

Money in development cost levy reserve funds, together with interest,
shall be used only




(a)

except for money raised for the purposes set forth in subsection
(2.1), to pay the costs of capital projects that relate directly or
indirectly to the development or parcel in respect of which the levy
was collected, or




(b)

to pay a person subject to a development cost levy for some or all of
the capital costs the person incurred in completing a capital project,
other than Replacement Housing, if




(i)

the capital project was completed under an agreement between the
person and the Council, and




(ii)

the capital project is included in the calculations used to determine
the amount of that development cost levy.




(17.01)

Payments out of a development costs levy reserve fund shall be
authorized by a resolution of Council, and one resolution may
authorize a series of payments in respect of any capital project.




(17.1)

In relation to a capital project of providing and improving park land,
money in a development cost levy reserve fund shall only be used for




(a)

acquiring park land or reclaiming land as park land,




(b)

providing fencing, landscaping, drainage and irrigation, trails,
restrooms, changing rooms and playground and playing field equipment
on park land, or




(c)

to pay a person subject to a development cost levy for some or all of
the capital costs the person incurred in completing a capital project
described in paragraph (a) or (b) if




(i)

the capital project was completed under an agreement between the
person and the Council, and




(ii)

the capital project is included in the calculations used to determine
the amount of that development cost levy.




(18)

Notwithstanding subsection (17), if money raised pursuant to a
development cost levy exceeds what is necessary to provide the capital
projects for which it was raised, the excess shall be set aside and
spent on projects to benefit, directly or indirectly, the areas or
zones in which the properties with respect to which the levy is
imposed are located.




(18.1)

In each year,




(a)

the Director of Finance must prepare and submit to the Council a
report for the previous year that includes the following, reported for
each purpose under this section for which the Council imposes the
development cost levy in the applicable year:




(i)

the amount of development cost levies received;




(ii)

the expenditures from the development cost levy reserve funds;




(iii)

the balance in the development cost levy reserve funds at the start
and at the end of the applicable year;




(iv)

any waivers and reductions under subsection (10.4), and




(b)

as soon as practicable after receiving the report, the Council must
consider the report and make it available to the public.




(19)

Nothing in this section restricts or affects any other power contained
in this Act, provided however that the cost of any capital project
shall be recovered only once.

withheld the issuance of any development or building permit for a
period of 30 days from the date of application for such permit.




(2)

Where any permit is so withheld, the application therefor shall be
considered by the Council within the said period of thirty days, and,

plan in the course of preparation, or with an alteration, addition, or
extension to an official development plan in course of preparation, or
with a zoning by-law in course of preparation, or with an amendment to
a zoning by-law in course of preparation, the Council may withhold the
permit for a further sixty days from the expiration of the thirty-day

conditions on the granting of the development permit as may appear to
the Council to be in the public interest.

days adopt any such plan, alteration, addition, extension, or by-law,
the owners of the land in respect of which a development permit was
withheld or conditions were imposed pursuant to this section shall be
entitled to compensation for damages arising from the withholding of
such development permit, or the imposition of such conditions. Such
compensation shall be determined by arbitration pursuant to the

Arbitration Act

been withheld before the adoption of a by-law designating a heritage
property may agree that a permit may be withheld for a period longer
than the 30 days referred to in subsection (1) and, in that case,
subsection (1) continues to apply during that longer period and
subsection (2) is deemed to read as if the longer period applies.
