Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations

provides further guidance in respect of these accounting principles.

The firm is required to deliver a copy of the executed subordination agreement to the regulator or, in Québec, the securities regulatory authority on the earlier of (a) 10 days after the date the agreement is executed or (b) the date an amount subordinated by the agreement is excluded from its calculation of excess working capital on Form 31-103F1

Calculation of Excess Working Capital

.

The firm must notify the regulator or, in Québec, the securities regulatory authority, 10 days before it repays the loan (in whole or in part), or terminates the subordination agreement.

See section 12.2 of National Instrument 31-103

Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations

.



Line 8. Minimum Capital

— The amount on this line must be not less than (a) $25,000 for an adviser and (b) $50,000 for a dealer. For an investment fund manager, the amount must be not less than $100,000 unless subsection 12.1 (4) of National Instrument 31-103

(i) If there is an unresolved difference relating to client securities, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the fair value of the client securities that are short, plus the applicable margin rate for those securities.


(ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the registrant's investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the fair value of the investments (securities) that are short.


(iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the shortfall in cash.
