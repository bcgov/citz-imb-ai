Schedule 2




Personal Information Collection Policy



The regulators and securities regulatory authorities (the

"regulators"

) listed in Schedule 3 of Appendix A to National Instrument 41-101

General Prospectus Requirements

(

"NI 41-101"

) collect the personal information in the personal information form as this term is defined in NI 41-101 (the

"Personal Information Form"

), under the authority granted to them under provincial and territorial securities legislation. Under securities legislation, the regulators do not make any of the information provided in the Personal Information Form public.


The regulators collect the personal information in the Personal Information Form for the purpose of enabling the regulators to administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities legislation, including those provisions that require or permit the regulators to refuse to issue a receipt for a prospectus if it appears to the regulators that the past conduct of management or promoters of the Issuer affords reasonable grounds for belief that the business of the Issuer will not be conducted with integrity and in the best interests of its securityholders.


You understand that by signing the certificate and consent in the Personal Information Form, you are consenting to the Issuer submitting your personal information in the Personal Information Form (the "Information") to the regulators and to the collection and use by the regulators of the Information, as well as any other information that may be necessary to administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities legislation. This may include the collection of information from law enforcement agencies, other government or non-governmental regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations, exchanges, and quotation and trade reporting systems in order to conduct background checks, verify the Information and perform investigations and conduct enforcement proceedings as required to ensure compliance with provincial and territorial securities legislation. Your consent also extends to the collection, use and disclosure of the Information as described above in respect of other prospectus filings of the Issuer and the prospectus filings of any other issuer in a situation where you are or will be:


(a) a director, executive officer or promoter of the other issuer,


(b) a director or executive officer of a promoter of the other issuer, if the promoter is not an individual, or


(c) where the other issuer is an investment fund, a director or executive officer of the investment fund manager.


You understand that the Issuer is required to deliver the Information to the regulators because the Issuer has filed a prospectus under provincial and territorial securities legislation. You also understand that you have a right to be informed of the existence of personal information about you that is kept by regulators, that you have the right to request access to that information, and that you have the right to request that such information be corrected, subject to the applicable provisions of the freedom of information and protection of privacy legislation adopted by each province and territory.


You also understand and agree that the Information the regulators collect about you may also be disclosed, as permitted by law, where its use and disclosure is for the purposes described above. The regulators may also use a third party to process the Information, but when this happens, the third party will be carefully selected and obligated to comply with the limited use restrictions described above and with provincial and federal privacy legislation.



Warning:

It is an offence to submit information that, in a material respect and at the time and in the light of the circumstances in which it is submitted, is misleading or untrue.



Questions



If you have any questions about the collection, use, and disclosure of the information you provide to the regulators, you may contact the regulator in the jurisdiction in which the required information is filed, at the address or telephone number listed in Schedule 3.

Form 41-101F1




Information Required in a Prospectus




GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS




(1) The objective of the prospectus is to provide information concerning the issuer that an investor needs in order to make an informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific disclosure requirements that are in addition to the general requirement under securities legislation to provide full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities to be distributed. Certain rules of specific application impose prospectus disclosure obligations in addition to those described in this Form.




(2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or interpreted in the Instrument bear that definition or interpretation. Other definitions are set out in NI 14-101.




(3) In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgment in the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of the information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is considered material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an offsetting effect.




(4) Unless an item specifically requires disclosure only in the preliminary prospectus, the disclosure requirements set out in this Form apply to both the preliminary prospectus and the prospectus. Details concerning the price and other matters dependent upon or relating to price, such as the number of securities being distributed, may be left out of the preliminary prospectus, along with specifics concerning the plan of distribution, to the extent that these matters have not been decided.




(5) The disclosure must be understandable to readers and presented in an easy-to-read format. The presentation of information should comply with the plain language principles listed in section 4.1 of Companion Policy 41-101CP General Prospectus Requirements. If technical terms are required, clear and concise explanations should be included.




(6) No reference need be made to inapplicable items and, unless otherwise required in this Form, negative answers to items may be omitted.




(7) Where the term "issuer" is used, it may be necessary, in order to meet the requirement for full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts, to also include disclosure with respect to persons or companies that the issuer is required, under the issuer's GAAP, to consolidate, proportionately consolidate or account for using the equity method (for example, including "subsidiaries" as that term is used in Canadian GAAP applicable to publicly accountable enterprises). If it is more likely than not that a person or company will become an entity that the issuer will be required, under the issuer's GAAP, to consolidate, proportionately consolidate or account for using the equity method, it may be necessary to also include disclosure with respect to the person or company.




(8) An issuer that is a special purpose entity may have to modify the disclosure items to reflect the special purpose nature of its business.




(9) If disclosure is required as of a specific date and there has been a material change or change that is otherwise significant in the required information subsequent to that date, present the information as of the date of the change or a date subsequent to the change instead.




(10) If an issuer discloses financial information in a preliminary prospectus or prospectus in a currency other than the Canadian dollar, prominently display the presentation currency.




(11) Except as otherwise required or permitted, include information in a narrative form. The issuer may include graphs, photographs, maps, artwork or other forms of illustration, if relevant to the business of the issuer or the distribution and not misleading. Include descriptive headings. Except for information that appears in a summary, information required under more than one Item need not be repeated.




(12) Certain requirements in this Form make reference to requirements in another instrument or form. Unless this Form states otherwise, issuers must also follow the instruction or requirement in the other instrument or form. These references include references to Form 51-102F2. Venture issuers must include such disclosure in a preliminary prospectus or prospectus even if they are not otherwise required to file an annual information form under NI 51-102.




(13) Wherever this Form uses the word "subsidiary", the term includes companies and other types of business organizations such as partnerships, trusts and other unincorporated business entities.




(14) Where requirements in this Form make reference to, or are substantially similar to, requirements in Form 51-102F2, issuers may apply the general provision in subpart 1 (d) of Form 51-102F2. However, issuers must supplement this disclosure if the supplemented disclosure is necessary to ensure that the prospectus provides full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts related to the securities to be distributed as required under Item 29 of this Form.




(15) Forward-looking information, as defined in NI 51-102, included in a prospectus must comply with section 4A.2 of NI 51-102 and must include the disclosure described in section 4A.3 of NI 51-102. In addition to the foregoing, FOFI or a financial outlook, each as defined in NI 51-102, included in a prospectus must comply with Part 4B of NI 51-102. If the forward-looking information relates to an issuer or other entity that is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction, section 4A.2, section 4A.3 and Part 4B of NI 51-102 apply as if the issuer or other entity were a reporting issuer in at least one jurisdiction.




(16) Marketing materials prepared in accordance with subsections 13.7 (1) or 13.8 (1) of the Instrument are the only documents that can be incorporated by reference into a long form prospectus.

[Name of the issuer]'s profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent before borrowing costs and income tax for the 12 months ended • was $•, which is • times [name of the issuer]'s aggregate dividend and borrowing cost requirements for this period."

] to which potential investors in [

insert the jurisdictions of Canada where the prospectus was filed

In doing so, the issuer and the underwriters relied on a provision in applicable securities legislation that allows issuers in certain U.S. cross-border offerings to not have to file marketing materials relating to those road shows on SEDAR+ or include or incorporate those marketing materials in the final prospectus. The issuer and the underwriters can only do that if they give a contractual right to investors in the event the marketing materials contain a misrepresentation.


Pursuant to that provision, the issuer and the underwriters signing the certificate contained in this prospectus have agreed that in the event the marketing materials relating to those road shows contain a misrepresentation (as defined in securities legislation in [

insert the jurisdictions of Canada where the prospectus was filed

]), a purchaser resident in [

insert the jurisdictions of Canada where the prospectus was filed

] who was provided with those marketing materials in connection with the road shows and who purchases the securities offered by this prospectus during the period of distribution shall have, without regard to whether the purchaser relied on the misrepresentation, rights against the issuer and each underwriter with respect to the misrepresentation which are equivalent to the rights under the securities legislation of the jurisdiction in Canada where the purchaser is resident, subject to the defences, limitations and other terms of that legislation, as if the misrepresentation was contained in this prospectus.


However, this contractual right does not apply to the extent that the contents of the marketing materials relating to the road shows have been modified or superseded by a statement in this prospectus. In particular, [

insert a description of how any statement in the marketing materials has been modified or superseded by a statement in the prospectus

]."

Form 41-101F2




Information Required in an Investment Fund Prospectus




GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS




(1) The objective of the prospectus is to provide information concerning the investment fund that an investor needs in order to make an informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific disclosure requirements that are in addition to the general requirement under securities legislation to provide full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities to be distributed. This Form does not prohibit including information beyond what the Form requires. Further, certain rules of specific application impose prospectus disclosure obligations in addition to those described in this Form.




(2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or interpreted in the Instrument must bear that definition or interpretation. Other definitions are set out in NI 14-101 Definitions.




(3) In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgment in the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of the information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is considered material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with respect to the investment fund's securities. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an offsetting effect.




(4) Unless an item specifically requires disclosure only in the preliminary prospectus, the disclosure requirements set out in this Form apply to both the preliminary prospectus and the prospectus. Details concerning the price and other matters dependent upon or relating to price, such as the number of securities being distributed, may be left out of the preliminary prospectus, along with specifics concerning the plan of distribution, to the extent that these matters have not been decided.




(5) The disclosure must be understandable to readers and presented in an easy-to-read format. The presentation of information should comply with the plain language principles listed in section 4.1 of Companion Policy 41-101CP General Prospectus Requirements. If technical terms are required, clear and concise explanations should be included.




(6) No reference need be made to inapplicable items and, unless otherwise required in this Form, negative answers to items may be omitted.




(7) The disclosure required in this Form must be presented in the order and using the headings specified in the Form. If no sub-heading for an Item is stipulated in this Form, an investment fund may include sub-headings under the required headings.




(8) Where the term "investment fund" is used, it may be necessary, in order to meet the requirement for full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts, to also include disclosure with respect to the investment fund's investees. If it is more likely than not that a person or company will become an investee, it may be necessary to also include disclosure with respect to the person or company. For this purpose, investees include entities that are consolidated, proportionately consolidated, or accounted for using the equity method.




(9) If disclosure is required as of a specific date and there has been a material change or change that is otherwise significant in the required information subsequent to that date, present the information as of the date of the change or a date subsequent to the change instead.




(10) If the term "class" is used in any item to describe securities, the term includes a series.




(11) Where performance data is presented in the prospectus, annual compound returns must be presented for standard applicable performance periods of 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods and the period since inception unless otherwise specified by the requirements of this Form. Performance data for periods of less than one year must not be presented. Hypothetical or back-tested performance data must not be presented.




(12) An investment fund that has more than one class or series that are referable to the same portfolio may treat each class or series as a separate investment fund for the purposes of this Form, or may combine disclosure of one or more of the classes or series in one prospectus. If disclosure pertaining to more than one class or series is combined in one prospectus, separate disclosure in response to each item in this Form must be provided for each class or series unless the responses would be identical for each class or series.




(13) A section, part, class or series of a class of securities of an investment fund that is referable to a separate portfolio is considered to be a separate investment fund for the purposes of this Form. An investment fund that has more than one class or series of securities referable to separate portfolios may combine disclosure of one or more of the classes or series in one prospectus if each class or series is managed by the same manager. If disclosure pertaining to more than one class or series is combined in one prospectus, separate disclosure in response to each item in this Form must be provided for each class or series unless the responses would be identical for each class or series.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS




(1) This Form describes the disclosure required in a scholarship plan prospectus. Each Item of this Form outlines disclosure requirements. Instructions as to how to complete this Form are printed in italic type.




(2) The objective of the scholarship plan prospectus is to provide information about the scholarship plan that an investor needs in order to make an informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific disclosure requirements that are in addition to the general requirement under securities legislation to provide full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities to be distributed.




(3) Terms defined in National Instrument 14-101

Definitions

, National Instrument 41-101

General Prospectus Requirements

, National Instrument 81-105

Mutual Fund Sales Practices

, National Instrument 81-106

Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure

or National Instrument 81-107

Independent Review Committee for Investment Funds

and used in this Form have the same meanings that they have in those national instruments except that references in those instruments to "mutual fund" must be read as references to "investment fund" or "scholarship plan" as the context requires.




(4) A scholarship plan prospectus must contain only the information that is mandated or permitted under this Form.




(5) A scholarship plan prospectus must present the information in each Part of this Form briefly and concisely, in the order provided for by this Form, and use only the headings and sub-headings stipulated in this Form except that sub-headings not required by this Form may be used where permitted under an Item in this Form.




(6) Specific instructions are sometimes provided in this Form for a single prospectus and a multiple prospectus. Portions of Part B and Part D of this Form generally refer to disclosure required for "a scholarship plan" in a "prospectus". This disclosure must be modified as appropriate to reflect multiple scholarship plans covered by a multiple prospectus.




(7) National Instrument 41-101 requires that a prospectus be prepared using plain language and in a format that assists in readability and comprehension. For additional guidance, see the plain language principles listed in section 4.1 of Companion Policy 41-101 CP

General Prospectus Requirements

. If the use of technical terms is required, clear and concise explanations of those terms must be included.




(8) Respond as simply and directly to the requirements of this Form as is reasonably possible.




(9) No reference need be made to inapplicable items and, unless otherwise required in this Form, negative answers to items may be omitted.




(10) Certain Items in this Form require that a prospectus include wording that is the same or substantially the same as set out in those Items. A scholarship plan may modify the prescribed wording to more accurately reflect its features if the wording does not apply to the plan.




(11) Unless otherwise stated, this Form does not mandate the use of a specific font size or style but the font used must be legible. If the prospectus is made available online, information must be presented in a way that is both readable online and can be printed in a readable format.




(12) A prospectus may contain photographs and artwork only if they are relevant to the business of the scholarship plan or members of the organization of the scholarship plan and are not misleading.




(13) A prospectus must not contain design elements (e.g., graphics, photos, artwork) that would, to a reasonable person, detract from the information disclosed in the document.




(14) If disclosure is required as of a specific date and there has been a material change or a change that is otherwise significant to a reasonable investor to the required information subsequent to that date, present the information as of the date of the change or a date subsequent to the change.





Contents of a Scholarship Plan Prospectus





(15) This Form permits two formats: a prospectus for a single scholarship plan and a multiple prospectus for multiple scholarship plans.




(16) A scholarship plan prospectus must consist of four parts as set out below. Part A is the Plan Summary. Parts B, C and D are collectively the Detailed Plan Disclosure. The Plan Summary and the Detailed Plan Disclosure together form the scholarship plan prospectus. The four parts may be further described as follows:




(a) Part A contains the responses to the Items in Part A of this Form. The information in this Part contains a summary of key information about investing in a scholarship plan.




(b) Part B contains the responses to the Items in Part B of this Form and contains introductory information about the scholarship plan and general information about the scholarship plan family.




(c) Part C contains the responses to the Items in Part C of the Form and contains plan-specific information about the scholarship plan(s) offered in the prospectus.




(d) Part D contains the responses to the Items in Part D of this Form and contains information about the scholarship plan organization, the persons and entities involved in running the scholarship plan, and the prospectus certificates.





Consolidation of Scholarship Plan Prospectuses into a Multiple Prospectus





(17) Section 3A.2 of National Instrument 41-101 requires that a scholarship plan prospectus must not be consolidated with one or more scholarship plan prospectuses to form a multiple prospectus unless the disclosure in each of the Part B and Part D sections of this Form is substantially similar for each scholarship plan. This provision permits a scholarship plan organization to create a document that contains the disclosure for a number of scholarship plans in the same family.




(18) Similar to a single prospectus, a multiple prospectus must consist of four segments:




(a) The first segment consists of a number of Part A sections of this Form. Each Part A section must contain the information required under Part A of this Form about a single scholarship plan. The information required by the Part A section must be disclosed separately for each scholarship plan in the multiple prospectus. Each Part A section in a multiple prospectus must start on a new page.




(b) The second segment contains the information required under Part B of this Form for the scholarship plans described in the document. There must not be more than one Part B section for all of the scholarship plans in the prospectus.




(c) The third segment consists of a number of Part C sections of this Form. Each Part C section must contain the information required under Part C of this Form about a single scholarship plan. The information required by the Part C section must be disclosed separately for each scholarship plan in the multiple prospectus. Each Part C section in a multiple prospectus must start on a new page.




(d) The fourth segment contains the information required under Part D of the Form for the scholarship plans described in the document. There must not be more than one Part D section for all of the scholarship plans in the prospectus.






Part A — Plan Summary for a Scholarship Plan






Item 1 — Information about the Plan



Include at the top of a new page a heading consisting of


(a) the title "Plan Summary",


(b) the name of the scholarship plan to which the Plan Summary pertains and, if the scholarship plan has more than one class or series of securities, the name of the class or series of securities covered in the Plan Summary,


(c) the type of scholarship plan,


(d) the name of the investment fund manager of the scholarship plan, and


(e) the date of the Plan Summary.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) The title "Plan Summary" and the name of the scholarship plan must be in bold type using a substantially larger font size than the other headings and text in the Plan Summary.




(2) The "type of scholarship plan" refers to whether the scholarship plan is a group scholarship plan, individual or family scholarship plan.




(3) The date for a Plan Summary that is filed as part of a preliminary scholarship plan prospectus or scholarship plan prospectus must be the date of the certificate of the scholarship plan required under Part D of this Form.






Item 2 — Withdrawal and Cancellation Rights



Immediately following the disclosure in Item 1, state the following using the same or substantially similar wording, with the last two sentences in bold type:


This summary tells you some key things about investing in the plan. You should read this Plan Summary and the Detailed Plan Disclosure carefully before you decide to invest.



If you change your mind



You have up to 60 days after signing your contract to withdraw from your plan and get back all of your money.


If you (or we) cancel your plan after 60 days, you'll get back your contributions, less sales charges and fees. You will lose the earnings on your money. Your government grants will be returned to the government.

Keep in mind that you pay sales charges up front. If you cancel your plan in the first few years, you could end up with much less than you put in.




INSTRUCTION




The prescribed wording in this Item must be presented using a substantially larger font size relative to the rest of the text of the Plan Summary.






Item 3 — Description of the Scholarship Plan



(1) Under the heading "What is the [insert type of scholarship plan] scholarship plan?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


The [insert name of plan] is a [insert type of plan] scholarship plan designed to help you save for a child's post-secondary education. When you open your [insert name of plan], we will apply to the Canada Revenue Agency to register the plan as a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP). This allows your savings to grow tax-free until the child named as the beneficiary of the plan enrols in their studies. The Government of Canada and some provincial governments offer government grants to help you save even more. To register your plan as an RESP, we need social insurance numbers for yourself and the child you name in the plan as the beneficiary.


In a [insert type of plan] scholarship plan, you are part of a group of investors. Everyone's contributions are invested together. When the plan matures, each child in the group shares in the earnings on that money. Your share of those earnings plus your government grant money is paid to your child as educational assistance payments (EAPs).


There are two main exceptions. Your child will not receive EAPs, and you could lose your earnings, government grants and grant contribution room, if:


• your child does not enrol in a school or program that qualifies under this plan, or


• you leave the plan before it matures.


(2) For a group scholarship plan, state the following using the same or substantially similar wording, in bold type:



If you leave the plan, your earnings go to the remaining members of the group. However, if you stay in the plan until it matures, you might share in the earnings of those who left early.




INSTRUCTION




If the scholarship plan allows a subscriber to name more than one beneficiary at a time, amend the wording in section (1) to refer to multiple children or beneficiaries.






Item 4 — Suitability



(1) For a group scholarship plan, under the heading "Who is this plan for?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


A group scholarship plan can be a long-term commitment. It is for investors planning to save for a child's post-secondary education and who are fairly sure that:


• they can make all their contributions on time


• they will stay in the plan until it matures


• their child will attend a qualifying school and program under the plan


[

Insert, for plan providers that also offer an individual or family scholarship plan

— If this doesn't describe you, you should consider another type of plan. For example, an individual or family plan has fewer restrictions. See the Plan Summar[y/ies] for our [

insert as applicable

— individual plan/family plan/individual and family plans] or pages [

insert applicable page references

] in the Detailed Plan Disclosure for more information.]


(2) For an individual or family scholarship plan, under the heading "Who is this plan for?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


[

Insert, as applicable

— An individual/A family] scholarship plan is for investors planning to save for a child's post-secondary education and who are fairly sure that:


• [

Insert, for family plans only

— they want to save for more than one child at a time]


• they want more flexibility over when and how much to contribute to their plan


• [

Insert, for individual plans only

— their child will attend a qualifying school and program under the plan]


• [

Insert, for family plans only

— one or more of their children will attend a qualifying school or program under the plan]


[

Insert, for plan providers that also offer a group scholarship plan

— The [

insert name of plan

] generally has fewer restrictions and is more flexible than our group scholarship plan.]





Item 5 — The Plan's Investments



Under the heading "What does the plan invest in?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:

Item 6 — Contributions



(1) For a group scholarship plan, under the heading "How do I make contributions?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


With your contributions, you buy one or more "units" of the plan. These units represent your share of the plan. You may pay for them all at once, or you may make [

state the most common contribution frequency options

] contributions.


You may change the amount of your contribution as long as you make the minimum contribution permitted under the plan. You may also change your contribution schedule after you've opened your plan. [

Insert if applicable — A fee applies.

] All of the different contribution options for the plan are described in the Detailed Plan Disclosure, or you can ask your sales representative for more information.


(2) For an individual or family scholarship plan, under the heading "How do I make contributions?", briefly describe how a subscriber can make contributions to their scholarship plan.


(3) State (i) the minimum total investment and (ii) the minimum amount per contribution, permitted under the scholarship plan's rules.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) The disclosure regarding contribution frequency options in the first paragraph of subsection (1) of Item 6 must make reference only to the most commonly selected contribution options, and not to each contribution option that is available to a subscriber.




(2) If the individual or family scholarship plan uses the concept of "units" or has prescribed schedules for making contributions, this fact must be described in the required disclosure for subsection (2) of Item 6, using wording that is similar to the wording in subsection (1) of Item 6.




(3) For the purposes of the disclosure required under subsection (3) of Item 6, the "minimum total investment permitted under the scholarship plan's rules" must be stated as (i) a dollar amount or (ii) a quantity of units or securities of the scholarship plan (if applicable) and the "minimum amount per contribution under the plan's rules" must be stated as a dollar amount.






Item 7 — Payments



(1) Under the heading "What can I expect to receive from the plan?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


In your child's first year of college or university, you'll get back your contributions, less fees. You can have this money paid to you or directly to your child.


(2) For a group scholarship plan, state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


Your child will be eligible to receive EAPs in their [

state, as applicable

— first, second, third and fourth] year[s] of post-secondary education. [

See instruction (1)

] For each year, your child must show proof they are enrolled in a school and program that qualifies under this plan to get an EAP.


(3) For an individual or family scholarship plan, briefly describe when EAPs can be paid to a beneficiary, and whether EAPs can be paid in one year or must be paid in instalments for each year of eligible studies.


(4) State the following, in a separate paragraph:


EAPs are taxed in the child's hands.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) If the group scholarship plan has multiple options for paying EAPs, disclose the other options in the disclosure in subsection (2) of Item 7, using a similar format.




(2) For the disclosure in subsection (3) of Item 7, the format set out for the disclosure in section (2) must be used.






Item 8 — Risks



(1) Under the heading "What are the risks?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


If you do not meet the terms of the plan, you could lose some or all of your investment. Your child may not receive their EAPs.


(2) For a group scholarship plan, state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


You should be aware of five things that could result in a loss:



1. You leave the plan before the maturity date.

People leave the plan for many reasons. For example, if their financial situation changes and they can't afford their contributions. If your plan is cancelled more than 60 days from signing your contract, you'll lose part of your contributions to sales charges and fees. You'll also lose the earnings on your investment and your government grants will be returned to the government.



2. You miss contributions.

If you want to stay in the plan, you'll have to make up the contributions you missed. You'll also have to make up what the contributions would have earned if you had made them on time. This could be costly.


If you have difficulty making contributions, you have options. You can reduce or suspend your contributions, transfer to another of our plans or to an RESP offered by a different provider, or cancel your plan. Restrictions and fees apply. Some options will result in a loss of earnings and government grants. [

Insert if applicable

— If you miss a contribution and don't take any action within [

insert the number of months

] months, we may cancel your plan].



3. You miss or your child misses a deadline.

This can limit your options later on. You could also lose the earnings on your investment. Two of the key deadlines for this plan are:


•

Maturity date — the deadline for making changes to your plan


You have until the maturity date to make changes to your plan. This includes switching the plan to a different child, changing the maturity date if your child wants to start their program sooner or later than expected, and transferring to another RESP. Restrictions and fees apply.


•

[

Insert date

] — the EAP application deadline


If your child qualifies for an EAP, he or she must apply by [

insert date

] before each year of eligible studies to receive a payment for that year. Otherwise, your child may lose this money.



4. Your child doesn't go to a qualifying school or program.

For example, [

State the types of programs or institutions that generally do not qualify for EAPs under the plan

] don't qualify for EAPs under this plan. [

Insert, if applicable

— Under this plan, fewer programs will qualify for an EAP than would otherwise qualify under the government's rules for RESPs. See the Detailed Plan Disclosure for more information.] If your child will not be going to a qualifying school or program under this plan, you have the option to name another child as beneficiary, transfer to another of our plans or to an RESP offered by a different provider, or cancel your plan. Restrictions and fees apply. Some options can result in a loss of earnings and government grants.



5. Your child doesn't complete their program.

Your child may lose some or all of their EAPs if he or she takes time off from their studies, does not complete all required courses in a year or changes programs. [

Insert if applicable

— In some cases, your child may be able to defer an EAP for up to [

insert number of years

] year[s]]. [

Insert, if applicable

— Deferrals are at our discretion.]


(3) For an individual or family scholarship plan, list no more than 5 situations that could result in a loss of earnings in the scholarship plan for subscribers or EAPs for the beneficiary. Briefly describe the losses that could result in these outcomes as well as some options to mitigate this loss.


(4) State the following, in bold type:



If any of these situations arise with your plan, contact us or speak with your sales representative to better understand your options to reduce your risk of loss.




INSTRUCTIONS




(1) For an individual or family scholarship plan, the disclosure required in subsection (3) of Item 8 must include the following situations: a subscriber leaving a scholarship plan before it matures, a beneficiary failing to enrol in a qualifying school or program, and the subscriber or beneficiary failing to meet the scholarship plan's key deadlines.




(2) If the individual or family scholarship plan uses the concept of units paid for under a fixed contribution schedule, or otherwise requires subscribers to follow a prescribed schedule for making contributions to the scholarship plan, the disclosure required in subsection (3) of Item 8 must also include a situation in which a subscriber misses one or more contributions.




(3) The disclosure in subsection (3) of Item 8 must use a similar format and structure as the disclosure required for group scholarship plans in section (2).






Item 9 — Cancellation Rate



For a group scholarship plan, using the margin of the page, add a sidebar under the heading "What are the risks?", and state the following using the same or substantially similar wording with the title of the sidebar in bold type:



Cancellation Rate



Of the last five beneficiary groups of the [

insert name of group scholarship plan

] plan to reach maturity, an average of [

see the Instructions

]% of the plans in each group were cancelled before their maturity date.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) To calculate the average percentage as required under Item 9, do the following:




(a) for each of the last five beneficiary groups in the group scholarship plan to reach maturity, calculate the percentage of scholarship plans in the beneficiary group that were cancelled before their maturity date, and




(b) calculate the simple average of the five percentages calculated pursuant to Instruction 1 (a).




(2) For a beneficiary group referred to in Instruction (1) (a), calculate the percentage of the scholarship plans in each beneficiary group that were cancelled before their maturity date by dividing x by y, where




x = the number of scholarship plans with the same maturity date that were cancelled before maturity, and




y = the total number of scholarship plans with the same maturity date, including plans with the same maturity date that were cancelled before maturity.




(3) For the purposes of the disclosure required under Item 9, a "plan that was cancelled before maturity" is a scholarship plan that is not eligible to receive a share of the EAP account as at the maturity date because the total contributions required by the subscriber's contract have not been made by the maturity date. The number of scholarship plans with the same maturity date that did not reach maturity will be the difference between the total number of scholarship plans with the same maturity date and the number of scholarship plans that matured.




(4) Subject to Instruction (6), the number of scholarship plans with the same maturity date consists of every scholarship plan sold to subscribers who selected the same maturity date, including scholarship plans that were cancelled or transferred before maturity.




(5) For the purposes of calculating the percentage of scholarship plans in a beneficiary group that were cancelled before maturity, a scholarship plan whose subscriber changed the maturity date to an earlier date is considered to have the earlier maturity date and must be included in the calculations for the beneficiary group with the earlier maturity date. Similarly, a scholarship plan whose subscriber changed the maturity date to a later date is considered to have the later maturity date and must be included in the calculations for the beneficiary group with the later maturity date.




(6) Do not include a plan in the calculation of x or y under Instruction (2) if the subscriber withdrew from their scholarship plan within 60 days of the signing the contract to open the scholarship plan and received back all of their contributions and fees paid.






Item 10 — Costs



(1) Under the heading "How much does it cost?", provide information, in the form of the following tables, about the fees and expenses of the scholarship plan. Introduce the tables using the following wording or wording that is the same or substantially similar:


There are costs for joining and participating in the plan. The following tables show the fees and expenses of the plan. [

Insert, if applicable

— The fees and expenses of this plan are different than the other plans we offer.]

(2) If the sales charge listed in the "Fees you pay" table required by subsection (1) is deducted from contributions at a higher rate in the early period of participating in the scholarship plan, add a sidebar under the heading "How much does it cost", using the margin of the page adjacent to the table titled "Fees you pay", and state the following using the same or substantially similar wording with the title of the sidebar in bold type:



Paying off the sales charge



If, for example, you buy one unit of the plan on behalf of your newborn child, and you commit to paying for that unit by making monthly contributions until your plan's maturity date, then, based on how the sales charge is deducted from your contributions, it will take [

insert number of months

] months to pay off the sales charge. During this time, [

insert percentage

]% of your contributions will be invested in the plan.


(3) Using the margin of the page adjacent to the table titled "Fees the plan pays", add a sidebar under the heading "How much does it cost?", and state the following using the same or substantially similar wording with the title of the sidebar in bold:



Other fees



Other fees apply if you make changes to your plan. See page [

specify page number

] in the Detailed Plan Disclosure for details.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) The tables must only summarize the most common fees that (i) all subscribers to the scholarship plan are required to pay or (ii) the scholarship plan is required to pay, as applicable. Do not include the entire list of fees required to be disclosed under Items 14.2 and 14.3 of Part C of the Form, or any of the fees required to be disclosed under Item 14.4 and 14.5 of Part C of the Form. Each fee must be listed in a separate row of the applicable table.




(2) If there are certain types of fees listed in the tables required under Item 10 above that are not payable, either by subscribers or the scholarship plan, in respect of the scholarship plan described in the Plan Summary, amend the tables as is necessary to reflect that fact.




(3) If certain fees listed in the tables required under Item 10 above are normally combined into a single fee payable by either the subscriber or the scholarship plan as applicable, the tables may be amended as is necessary to accurately reflect that fact.




(4) State the amount of each fee listed in the tables. In the table titled "Fees you pay" state the amount(s) in the column titled "What you pay". In the table titled "Fees the plan pays" state the amount(s) in the column titled "What the plan pays". The amount of each fee must be disclosed based on how the fee is calculated. For example, if a particular fee is calculated as a fixed dollar amount per unit, or a fixed amount per year, it must be stated as such. Similarly, if a fee is calculated as a percentage of the scholarship plan's assets, that percentage must be stated. A statement or note that a fee is subject to applicable taxes, such as goods and services taxes or harmonized sales taxes, is permitted, if applicable.




(5) For a group scholarship plan or other type of scholarship plan that normally calculates the sales charge payable as a fixed dollar amount linked to the amount of contribution by a subscriber (i.e. $x.xx per unit), in addition to stating the fixed amount of sales charge per unit as required under Instruction (3), the disclosure of the amount of the sales charge in the table titled "Fees you pay" in the column titled "What you pay" must also be expressed as a percentage of the cost of a unit of the scholarship plan. If the total cost of a unit of the scholarship plan varies depending on the contribution option or frequency selected, the percentage sales charge must be expressed as a range, between the lowest and the highest percentage of the unit cost the sales charge can represent, based on the different contribution options available to subscribers under the scholarship plan. This must be calculated as follows: (i) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the highest total cost per unit, and (ii) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the lowest total cost per unit. For example, if a scholarship plan calculates its sales charge as $200/unit, and the total cost per unit for a subscriber can range from $1 000 to $5 000 (based on the different options available to subscribers), the percentage range of the sales charge disclosed in the table would be 4% (200/5000) to 20% (200/1000). The disclosure in the table must also state that the exact percentage of the sales charge per unit for a subscriber will depend on the contribution option selected for contributing to the scholarship plan and how old their beneficiary is at the time they open the scholarship plan.




(6) For the table titled "Fees you pay", in the column titled "What you pay" describe how the fee is deducted from contributions if the amount deducted from each contribution is not the same. For example, if deductions for sales charges are not made from each contribution at a constant rate for the duration of a subscriber's investment in the scholarship plan or the duration for which contributions are required to be made if it is less than the scholarship plan's duration, describe the amounts from contributions that are deducted for sales charges.




(7) In both tables, in the column titled "What the fee is for" provide a concise explanation of what the fee is used for, using the same or substantially similar wording provided above in the tables.




(8) In both tables, in the column titled "Who the fee is paid to", state the name of the entity to which the fee is paid, e.g. the investment fund manager, the portfolio manager, the principal distributor or dealer, the foundation, etc.




(9) For the table titled "Fees the plan pays", the independent review committee fee must be disclosed as the total dollar amount paid in connection with the independent review committee for the most recently completed financial year of the scholarship plan.




(10) Disclosure of insurance premiums in the "Fees you pay" table is permitted only if the scholarship plan requires a subscriber to purchase insurance coverage in a jurisdiction in which the scholarship plan's securities are being distributed. If the scholarship plan's rules only require insurance coverage to be purchased by subscribers in some, but not all jurisdictions in which the scholarship plan's securities are distributed, then include disclosure stating the jurisdictions in which the scholarship plan requires subscribers to purchase insurance, under the heading titled "What the fee is for" in that table.




(11) The disclosure required under subsection (2) of Item 10 must be based on the following assumptions: (i) the beneficiary is a newborn, (ii) the subscriber is purchasing one unit of the scholarship plan, (iii) the subscriber has agreed to a monthly contribution schedule with contributions payable until the scholarship plan's maturity date, and (iv) all of the mandatory fees that are normally deducted from a subscriber's contributions are deducted during the relevant period.




(12) For the disclosure required in subsection (2) of Item 10, if the scholarship plan does not offer units but uses a similar method for deducting sales charges as is described under subsection (2) of Item 10, the wording may be amended as is necessary to properly reflect the scholarship plan's features.




(13) The "Other fees" sidebar required under subsection (3) of Item 10 refers to fees for specific transactions, such as changing a beneficiary, that are described in the table titled "Transaction Fees" in Item 14.4 of Part C of the Form.






Item 11 — Guarantees



Under the heading "Are there any guarantees?", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


We cannot tell you in advance if your child will qualify to receive any payments from the plan or how much your child will receive. We do not guarantee the amount of any payments or that the payments will cover the full cost of your child's post-secondary education.


Unlike bank accounts or GICs, investments in scholarship plans are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government insurer.





Item 12 — For More Information



(1) Under the sub-heading "For more information", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


The Detailed Plan Disclosure delivered with this Plan Summary contains further details about this plan, and we recommend you read it. You may also contact [

insert name of investment fund manager

] or your sales representative for more information about this plan.

Starting on a new page on the inside cover page under the heading "Important information to know before you invest", include an introduction to the information provided in response to sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 of this Part using the following wording:


The following is important information you should know if you are considering an investment in a scholarship plan.





2.2 — No Social Insurance Number



Under the sub-heading "No social insurance number = No government grants, no tax benefits", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording with the last paragraph in bold type:


We need social insurance numbers for you and each child named as a beneficiary under the plan before we can register your plan as a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP). The

Income Tax Act

(Canada) won't allow us to register your plan as an RESP without these social insurance numbers. Your plan must be registered before it can:


• qualify for the tax benefits of an RESP, and


• receive any government grants.


You can provide the beneficiary's social insurance number after the plan is open. If you don't provide the beneficiary's social insurance number when you sign your contract with us, we'll put your contributions into an unregistered education savings account. During the time your contributions are held in this account, we will deduct sales charges and fees from your contributions as described under "Costs of investing in this plan" in the prospectus. You will be taxed on any income earned in this account.


If we receive the beneficiary's social insurance number within [

insert the number of months — see Instruction (1)

] months of your application date, we'll transfer your contributions and the income they earned to your registered plan.


If we do not receive the social insurance numbers within [

insert number of months — see Instruction (1)

] months of your application date, we'll cancel your plan. You'll get back your contributions and the income earned, less sales charges and fees. Since you pay sales charges up front, you could end up with much less than you put in.



If you don't expect to get the social insurance number for your beneficiary within [insert number of months — see Instruction (1)] months of your application date, you should not enrol or make contributions to the plan.




INSTRUCTIONS




(1) State the maximum number of months after the application date of a subscriber's plan the following which the investment fund manager will cancel the scholarship plan for failure to provide the social insurance numbers required for registering the scholarship plan as an RESP.




(2) If the scholarship plan's rules do not permit a subscriber to open the plan or accept contributions without the beneficiary's social insurance number, amend the disclosure in this section to reflect that fact.






2.3 — Payments Not Guaranteed



(1) Following the disclosure required under section 2.2, state the following, on the inside cover page under the sub-heading "Payments not guaranteed", using the same or substantially similar wording:


We cannot tell you in advance if your beneficiary will qualify to receive any educational assistance payments (EAPs) [

insert, if applicable

— or any discretionary payments] from the plan or how much your beneficiary will receive. We do not guarantee the amount of any payments or that they will cover the full cost of your beneficiary's post-secondary education.


(2) For a group scholarship plan, under the sub-heading "Payments from group plans depend on several factors", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


The amount of the EAPs from a group plan will depend on how much the plan earns and the number of beneficiaries in the group who do not qualify for payments.


(3) If the scholarship plan provides for any discretionary payments, immediately following the disclosure required under subsection 2.3 (1) or 2.3 (2), as applicable, list the discretionary payments that may be provided and state the following using the same or substantially similar wording with the first sentence in bold type:



Discretionary payments are not guaranteed.

You must not count on receiving a discretionary payment. The [

insert the name of the entity funding the discretionary payment

] makes a payment, you may get less than what has been paid in the past.


(4) Under the sub-heading "Understand the risks", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording in bold type:



If you withdraw your contributions early or do not meet the terms of the plan, you could lose some or all of your money. Make sure you understand the risks before you invest. Carefully read the information found under "Risks of investing in a scholarship plan" and "Risks of investing in this plan" in this Detailed Plan Disclosure.






2.4 — Withdrawal and Cancellation Rights



Under the sub-heading "If you change your mind", state the following using the same or substantially similar wording with the last two sentences in bold type:


You have up to 60 days after signing your contract to withdraw from your plan and get back all of your money.


If you (or we) cancel your plan after 60 days, you'll get back your contributions, less sales charges and fees. You will lose the earnings on your money. Your government grants will be returned to the government.

Keep in mind that you pay sales charges up front. If you cancel your plan in the first few years, you could end up with much less than you put in.

A scholarship plan is a type of investment fund that is designed to help you save for a beneficiary's post-secondary education.

You will get back your contributions, less fees, whether or not your beneficiary goes on to post-secondary education. Your beneficiary will receive educational assistance payments (EAPs) from us if they enrol in eligible studies and all the terms of the contract are met.

] of your contributions will be used to pay the sales charge and [

] of your contributions will be invested in your plan.


(3) State whether any of the fees listed in the table in subsection (1) may be increased without subscriber approval.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) In the table required under subsection 14.2 (1), list the fees payable by subscribers' contributions. Each fee must be listed on a separate row in the table.




(2) In the table required under subsection 14.2 (1) in the column titled "What you pay" state the amount of each fee. The amount of each fee must be disclosed based on how the fee is calculated. For example, if a particular fee is calculated as a fixed dollar amount per unit, or a fixed amount per year, it must be stated as such. Similarly, if a fee is calculated as a percentage of plan assets, that percentage must be stated. A statement or note that a fee is subject to applicable taxes, such as goods and services taxes or harmonized sales taxes, is permitted, if applicable.




(3) For a group scholarship plan or other type of scholarship plan that normally calculates the sales charge payable as a fixed dollar amount linked to the amount of contribution by a subscriber (i.e. $x.xx per unit), in addition to stating the fixed amount of sales charge per unit as required under Instruction (2), the disclosure of the amount of sales charge in the table required under subsection 14.2 (1) in the column titled "What you pay" must also be expressed as a percentage of the cost of a unit of the scholarship plan. If the total cost of a unit of the scholarship plan varies depending on the contribution option or frequency selected, the percentage sales charge must be expressed as a range, between the lowest and the highest percentage of the unit cost the sales charge can represent, based on the different contribution options available to subscribers under the scholarship plan. This must be calculated as follows: (i) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the highest total cost per unit, and (ii) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the lowest total cost per unit. For example, if a scholarship plan calculates its sales charge as $200/unit, and the total cost per unit for a subscriber can range from $1 000 to $5 000 (based on the different options available to subscribers), the percentage range of the sales charge disclosed in the table would be 4% (200/5000) to 20% (200/1000). The disclosure in the table must also state that the exact percentage of the sales charge per unit for a subscriber will depend on the contribution option selected for contributing to the scholarship plan and how old their beneficiary is at the time they open the scholarship plan.




(4) In the table required under subsection 14.2 (1) in the column titled "What you pay" describe how the fee is deducted from contributions if the fee amount deducted from each contribution is not the same. For example, if deductions for sales charges are not made from each contribution at a constant rate for the duration of the plan or for the period for which contributions are required to be made under the scholarship plan if it is less than the scholarship plan's duration, describe the amounts from contributions that are deducted to pay sales charges.




(5) In the table required under subsection 14.2 (1) in the column titled "What the fee is for" provide a concise explanation of what the fee is used for.




(6) In the table required under subsection 14.2 (1) in the column titled "Who the fee is paid to", state the name of the entity to which the fee is paid, such as the investment fund manager, the portfolio manager, the dealer, the foundation, etc.




(7) The disclosure required under subsection 14.2 (2) must be based on the following assumptions: (i) the beneficiary is a newborn, (ii) the subscriber is purchasing one unit of the scholarship plan, (iii) the subscriber has agreed to a monthly contribution schedule with contributions payable until the scholarship plan's maturity date, and (iv) all of the mandatory fees that are normally deducted from a subscriber's contributions are deducted during the relevant period. The disclosure provided under subsection 14.2 (2) must be consistent with the disclosure provided under subsection (2) of Item 10 of Part A of the form.




(8) The disclosure required in subsection 14.2 (2) may alternatively be provided in a text box below the table required under subsection 14.2 (1).




(9) For the disclosure required in subsection 14.2 (2), if the scholarship plan does not offer units but uses a similar method for deducting sales charges as is described under subsection 14.2 (2), the wording may be amended as is necessary to properly reflect the scholarship plan's features.






14.3 — Fees Payable by the Scholarship Plan



(1) Under the sub-heading "Fees the plan pays", provide a list of the fees and expenses that are payable by the scholarship plan in the form of the following table and introduced using the following wording:

(2) If one or more fees listed or required to be listed in the table are normally combined into an "all-inclusive fee" payable by the scholarship plan, the table may be amended as is necessary to reflect this fact.




(3) In the column titled "What the plan pays" state the amount of each fee listed in the table. The amount of fee stated must be disclosed based on how the fee is calculated. For example, if a fee is calculated based on a percentage of the scholarship plan's assets, it must be stated as such.

(3) For a group scholarship plan, if the total amount of EAPs payable to beneficiaries differs based on the number of years of eligible studies, disclose the number of years of eligible studies that qualifies for the payment of the maximum total amount of EAPs and briefly describe the eligible studies with that duration.


(4) For a group scholarship plan that does not offer EAP payment options tailored to reduced programs, state, if applicable, that beneficiaries who enrol in eligible studies of a shorter duration than the full period will not qualify for the maximum number of EAPs and will receive a lower total amount of EAPs over the duration of their eligible studies than beneficiaries who enrol in eligible studies for the full period.


(5) For a group scholarship plan that offers EAP payment options tailored to reduced programs, if the total amount of EAPs payable under an EAP payment option tailored to reduced programs is less than the maximum total amount of EAPs, state the total amount of EAPs payable under the EAP payment option as a percentage of the maximum total amount of EAPs.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) In providing the disclosure under subsection 19.2 (1), do not repeat the type of studies that qualify for EAPs. Instead, include a cross-reference to the disclosure provided under section 6.2 of Part C of this Form.




(2) The disclosure under subsection 19.2 (1) must include a discussion of any requirements for a beneficiary to remain eligible for EAPs under the scholarship plan for each successive year of study.




(3) The "maximum total amount of EAPs" is the total amount of EAPs that can be received by a beneficiary who meets the requirements of the scholarship plan for receiving the maximum number and amount of EAPs.




(4) In providing the disclosure under subsection 19.2 (3), describe generally the types of programs for which a beneficiary will receive the maximum total amount of EAPs (for example, four years of eligible studies that may consist of a 4-year program or two 2-year programs).




(5) The "full period" is the number of years of eligible studies that qualifies for the payment of the maximum total number and amount of EAPs.




(6) An "EAP payment option tailored to reduced programs" is an EAP payment option that pays approximately same total amount of EAPs for eligible studies with a shorter duration as the EAPs payable under the scholarship plan for eligible studies of longer duration. For example, an EAP payment option that makes two payments for a 2-year post-secondary program, where each payment is twice the amount of each of the four payments that would be made for a 4-year post-secondary program, is an EAP payment option tailored to reduced programs.




(7) A scholarship plan may use a table to illustrate the schedule of payments and the amount paid in each year of eligible studies for each EAP payment option offered.






19.3 — Amount of EAPs



(1) Under sub-sub-heading, "How we determine EAP amounts", state the components of EAPs paid under the scholarship plan.

(3) Describe any restrictions, under the Income Tax Act (Canada) or the scholarship plan's rules, on the amount of EAP that can be paid for each year of eligible studies.


(4) Describe, as applicable to the type of scholarship plan,


(a) how unrealized capital gains or losses on investments in the scholarship plan are allocated;


(b) how earnings attributable to units or plans cancelled before the maturity date are allocated;


(c) how earnings attributable to units or plans cancelled after the maturity date are allocated;


(d) how the difference between the maximum total amount of EAPs and the lower amount collected by beneficiaries who enrol in eligible studies that do not qualify for the maximum total amount of EAPs is allocated;


(e) how the government grants accrued in the scholarship plan and the earnings from government grants are allocated.



INSTRUCTION




The amount for which disclosure is required under paragraph 19.3 (4) (d) is the amount that is not collected by beneficiaries in a beneficiary group because they do not enrol in eligible studies of sufficient duration to qualify for the maximum total amount of EAPs.






19.4 — Payments from the EAP Account



(1) This section applies to a group scholarship plan.


(2) Under the sub-sub-heading "Payments from the EAP account", provide information in the form of the following table about the funding of the EAP account. Introduce the table using the following wording or wording that is substantially similar with the title of the table "Past breakdown of income in the EAP account" in bold type:


A portion of each EAP consists of a beneficiary's share of the EAP account. The rest of an EAP is made up of the beneficiary's government grants and the earnings on those government grants.


The EAP account holds the income earned on contributions made by subscribers. This includes the income earned on contributions of subscribers who have cancelled their plan or whose plan was cancelled by us. There is a separate EAP account for each beneficiary group.



Past breakdown of income in the EAP account



The table below shows the breakdown of income in the EAP account at the maturity date for the five beneficiary groups that most recently reached their year of eligibility.


The breakdown of income can vary by beneficiary group. The amount of income earned on contributions depends on the performance of the plan's investments. The amount of income from cancelled plans depends on how many plans were cancelled, as well as the investment performance of that money.

You and your beneficiary must meet the terms of the plan in order for your beneficiary to qualify for all of the EAPs under the plan. If beneficiaries fail to qualify for some or all of their EAPs, there will be fewer beneficiaries remaining in the beneficiary group to share the amount of money available for paying EAPs. This is known as "attrition".


Your beneficiary may not qualify for some or all of their EAPs if:


• before the maturity date of the plan, you cancel your plan or transfer your plan to another RESP, or we cancel your plan because you failed to make contributions on schedule and did not take action to keep your plan in good standing. This is known as "pre-maturity attrition"; or


• after the maturity date of the plan, your beneficiary decides not to pursue a post-secondary education, does not attend a qualifying education program, or does not attend a qualifying education institution for the maximum period provided for in the plan. This is known as "post-maturity attrition".

(2) If the group scholarship plan permits a subscriber to receive an AIP on the earnings from government grants, state the following using the same or substantially similar wording:


You may, however, be eligible to receive an AIP on the earnings from the government grants in your plan. See "Accumulated income payments" for information on how to determine if you are eligible for an AIP from the plan.

• The Average Bid-Ask Spread must be calculated by taking the average of the daily average bid-ask spread (the Daily Bid-Ask Spread) using the bid and ask orders displayed on the primary Canadian listing exchange (the Listing Exchange) for the class or series of the ETF for each day the Listing Exchange was open for trading (each, a Trading Day) over the 12-month period ending within 60 days before the date of the ETF facts document (the Time Period).




• Each Daily Bid-Ask Spread must be calculated by taking the average of the intraday bid-ask spreads (each, an Intraday Bid-Ask Spread) for each Trading Day.




• An Intraday Bid-Ask Spread must be calculated at each one second interval beginning 15 minutes after the opening and ending 15 minutes prior to the closing of the Listing Exchange (the Interval Points).




• The bid price at each Interval Point (the Interval Bid Price) must be determined by multiplying each bid price by its displayed order amount in number of shares until the sum of $50,000 (Bid Market Depth) is reached then dividing by the total number of securities bid.




• The ask price at each Interval Point (the Interval Ask Price) must be determined by multiplying each ask price by its displayed order amount in number of securities until the sum of $50,000 (Ask Market Depth) is reached then dividing by the total number of securities offered.




• The bid-ask spread at each Interval Point (the Interval Bid-Ask Spread) is determined by calculating the difference between the Interval Bid Price and the Interval Ask Price and dividing by the midpoint of the Interval Bid Price and Interval Ask Price.




• If the Listing Exchange for the ETF does not have sufficient Bid Market Depth, bid orders from other Canadian marketplaces must be used to the extent necessary to arrive at the Bid Market Depth.




• If the Listing Exchange for the ETF does not have sufficient Ask Market Depth, ask orders from other Canadian marketplaces must be used to the extent necessary to arrive at the Ask Market Depth.




• If the Listing Exchange has sufficient Bid Market Depth or Ask Market Depth the ETF may, at its discretion, also include bid and ask orders from other Canadian marketplaces in its calculation of the Interval Bid-Ask Spread.




If there is insufficient Bid Market Depth or Ask Market Depth at a particular Interval Point even after including data from all Canadian marketplaces, no Interval Bid-Ask Spread can be calculated for that Interval Point. In order to include the Daily Average Bid-Ask Spread for a particular Trading Day in the 12-month Average Bid-Ask Spread calculation, the ETF must be able to calculate an Interval Bid-Ask Spread for at least 75% of the Interval Points in that Trading Day. In order to calculate the 12-month Average Bid-Ask Spread, the ETF must be able to calculate a Daily Bid-Ask Spread for at least 75% of the Trading Days over the Time Period. For a newly established ETF, state that the Average Bid-Ask Spread is not available because it is a new ETF. For an ETF that has not yet completed 12 consecutive months, state that the Average Bid-Ask Spread is not available because the ETF has not yet completed 12 consecutive months. For an ETF that has completed 12 consecutive months but does not have sufficient data to calculate the Average Bid-Ask Spread, state the following: "This ETF did not have sufficient market depth ($50,000) to calculate the average bid-ask spread."

(11) Each investment mix chart or table must show a breakdown of the ETF's investment portfolio into appropriate subgroups and the percentage of the aggregate net asset value of the ETF constituted by each subgroup. The names of the subgroups are not prescribed and can include security type, industry segment or geographic location. The ETF should use the most appropriate categories given the nature of the ETF. The choices made must be consistent with disclosure provided under "Summary of Investment Portfolio" in the ETF's management report of fund performance.




(12) In presenting the investment mix of the ETF, consider the most effective way of conveying the information to investors. All tables or charts must be clear and legible.




(13) For new ETFs where the information required to be disclosed under "Top 10 investments" and "Investment mix" is not available, include the required sub-headings and provide a brief statement explaining why the required information is not available.




Item 4 — Risks



(1) Under the heading "How risky is it?", state the following:


The value of the ETF can go down as well as up. You could lose money.


One way to gauge risk is to look at how much an ETF's returns change over time. This is called "volatility".


In general, ETFs with higher volatility will have returns that change more over time. They typically have a greater chance of losing money and may have a greater chance of higher returns. ETFs with lower volatility tend to have returns that change less over time. They typically have lower returns and may have a lower chance of losing money.


(2) Under the sub-heading "Risk rating",


(a) using the investment risk classification methodology prescribed by Appendix F —

Investment Risk Classification Methodology

to National Instrument 81-102

Investment Funds

, identify the ETF's investment risk level on the following risk scale:





Low


Low to medium


Medium


Medium to high


High





(b) unless the ETF is a newly established ETF, include an introduction to the risk scale which states the following:


[Insert name of the manager of the ETF] has rated the volatility of this ETF as [insert investment risk level identified in paragraph (a) in bold type].


This rating is based on how much the ETF's returns have changed from year to year. It doesn't tell you how volatile the ETF will be in the future. The rating can change over time. An ETF with a low risk rating can still lose money.


(c) for a newly established ETF, include an introduction to the risk scale which states the following:


[Insert name of the manager of the ETF] has rated the volatility of this ETF as [insert investment risk level identified in paragraph (a) in bold type].


Because this is a new ETF, the risk rating is only an estimate by [insert name of the manager of the ETF]. Generally, the rating is based on how much the ETF's returns have changed from year to year. It doesn't tell you how volatile the ETF will be in the future. The rating can change over time. An ETF with a low risk rating can still lose money.


(d) following the risk scale, state using wording substantially similar to the following:


For more information about the risk rating and specific risks that can affect the ETF's returns, see the [insert cross-reference to the appropriate section of the ETF's final prospectus] section of the ETF's prospectus.


(3) If the ETF does not have any guarantee or insurance, under the sub-heading "No guarantees", state using wording substantially similar to the following:


ETFs do not have any guarantees. You may not get back the amount of money you invest.


(4) If the ETF has an insurance or guarantee feature protecting all or some of the principal amount of an investment in the ETF, under the sub-heading "Guarantees":


(a) identify the person or company providing the guarantee or insurance; and


(b) provide a brief description of the material terms of the guarantee or insurance, including the maturity date of the guarantee or insurance.



INSTRUCTIONS




Based upon the investment risk classification methodology prescribed by Appendix F — Investment Risk Classification Methodology to National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds, as at the end of the period that ends within 60 days before the date of the ETF facts document, identify where the ETF fits on the continuum of investment risk levels by showing the full investment risk scale and highlighting the applicable category on the scale. Consideration should be given to ensure that the highlighted investment risk rating is easily identifiable.




Item 5 — Past Performance



(1) Unless the ETF is a newly established ETF, under the heading "How has the ETF performed?", include an introduction using wording substantially similar to the following:


This section tells you how [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF have performed over the past [insert number of calendar years shown in the bar chart required under paragraph (3) (a)] years. Returns [add a footnote stating: Returns are calculated using the ETF's net asset value (NAV).] after expenses have been deducted. These expenses reduce the ETF's returns. (For an ETF that replicates an index, state: This means that the ETF's returns may not match the returns of the [index/benchmark].)


(2) For a newly established ETF, under the heading "How has the ETF performed?", include an introduction using the following wording:


This section tells you how [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF have performed, with returns calculated using the ETF's net asset value (NAV). However, this information is not available because the ETF is new.


(3) Under the sub-heading "Year-by-year returns",


(a) for an ETF that has completed at least one calendar year:


(i) provide a bar chart that shows the annual total return of the ETF, in chronological order with the most recent year on the right of the bar chart, for the lesser of


(A) each of the 10 most recently completed calendar years, and


(B) each of the completed calendar years in which the ETF has been in existence and for which the ETF was a reporting issuer; and


(ii) include an introduction to the bar chart using wording substantially similar to the following:


This chart shows how [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF performed in each of the past [insert number of calendar years shown in the bar chart required under paragraph (a)]. The ETF dropped in value in [for the particular years shown in the bar chart required under paragraph (a), insert the number of years in which the value of the ETF dropped] of the [insert number of calendar years shown in the bar chart required in paragraph (a) (i)] years. The range of returns and change from year to year can help you assess how risky the ETF has been in the past. It does not tell you how the ETF will perform in the future.


(b) for an ETF that has not yet completed a calendar year, state the following:


This section tells you how [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF have performed in past calendar years. However, this information is not available because the ETF has not yet completed a calendar year.


(c) for a newly established ETF, state the following:


This section tells you how [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF have performed in past calendar years. However, this information is not available because the ETF is new.


(4) Under the sub-heading "Best and worst 3-month returns",


(a) for an ETF that has completed at least one calendar year:


(i) provide information for the period covered in the bar chart required under paragraph (3) (a) in the form of the following table:

This table shows the best and worst returns for the [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF in a 3-month period over the past [insert number of calendar years shown in the bar chart required under paragraph (3) (a)]. The best and worst 3-month returns could be higher or lower in the future. Consider how much of a loss you could afford to take in a short period of time.


(b) for an ETF that has not yet completed a calendar year, state the following:


This section shows the best and worst returns for the [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF in a 3-month period. However, this information is not available because the ETF has not yet completed a calendar year.


(c) for a newly established ETF, state the following:


This section shows the best and worst returns for the [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF in a 3-month period. However, this information is not available because the ETF is new.


(5) Under the sub-heading "Average return",


(a) for an ETF that has completed at least 12 consecutive months, show the following:


(i) the final value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment in the ETF as at the end of the period that ends within 60 days before the date of the ETF facts document and consists of the lesser of

(B) the time since inception of the ETF; and


(ii) the annual compounded rate of return that equates the hypothetical $1,000 investment to the final value.


(b) for an ETF that has not yet completed 12 consecutive months, state the following:


This section shows the value and annual compounded rate of return of a hypothetical $1,000 investment in [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF. However, this information is not available because the ETF has not yet completed 12 consecutive months.


(c) for a newly established ETF, state the following:


This section shows the value and annual compounded rate of return of a hypothetical $1,000 investment in [name of class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF. However, this information is not available because the ETF is new.

(1) In responding to the requirements of this Item, an ETF must comply with the relevant sections of Part 15 of National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds as if those sections applied to an ETF facts document.




(2) Use a linear scale for each axis of the bar chart required by this Item.




(3) The x-axis and y-axis for the bar chart required by this Item must intersect at zero.




(4) An ETF that distributes different classes or series of securities that are referable to the same portfolio of assets must show performance data related only to the specific class or series of securities being described in the ETF facts document.

Item 6 — Trading ETFs



Under the sub-heading "Trading ETFs", state the following:


ETFs hold a basket of investments, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges like stocks. Here are a few things to keep in mind when trading ETFs:


Pricing [in bold type]


ETFs have two sets of prices: market price and net asset value (NAV).


Market price


ETFs are bought and sold on exchanges at the market price. The market price can change throughout the trading day. Factors like supply, demand, and changes in the value of an ETF's investments can affect the market price.


You can get price quotes any time during the trading day. Quotes have two parts: bid and ask.


The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay if you want to sell your ETF [units/shares]. The ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept if you want to buy ETF [units/shares]. The difference between the two is called the "bid-ask spread".


In general, a smaller bid-ask spread means the ETF is more liquid. That means you are more likely to get the price you expect.


Net asset value (NAV)


Like mutual funds, ETFs have a NAV. It is calculated after the close of each trading day and reflects the value of an ETF's investments at that point in time.


NAV is used to calculate financial information for reporting purposes — like the returns shown in this document.


Orders [in bold type]


There are two main options for placing trades: market orders and limit orders. A market order lets you buy or sell [units/shares] at the current market price. A limit order lets you set the price at which you are willing to buy or sell [units/shares].


Timing [in bold type]


In general, market prices of ETFs can be more volatile around the start and end of the trading day. Consider using a limit order or placing a trade at another time during the trading day.



Item 7 — Suitability



Provide a brief statement of the suitability of the ETF for particular investors under the heading "Who is this ETF for?". Describe the characteristics of the investor for whom the ETF may or may not be an appropriate investment, and the portfolios for which the ETF is and is not suited.



INSTRUCTIONS




(1) If the ETF is particularly unsuitable for certain types of investors or for certain types of investment portfolios, emphasize this aspect of the ETF. Disclose both the types of investors who should not invest in the ETF, with regard to investments on both a short- and long-term basis, and the types of portfolios that should not invest in the ETF. If the ETF is particularly suitable for investors who have particular investment objectives, this can also be disclosed.




(2) If there is textbox disclosure on the cover page pursuant to Item 1 (g) of Part I of this form, the brief statement of the suitability of the ETF in Item 8 of Part I of this form must be consistent with any suitability disclosure in the textbox.




Item 8 — Impact of Income Taxes on Investor Returns



Under the heading "A word about tax", provide a brief explanation of the income tax consequences for investors using wording substantially similar to the following:


In general, you'll have to pay income tax on any money you make on an ETF. How much you pay depends on the tax laws where you live and whether or not you hold the ETF in a registered plan such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan, or a Tax-Free Savings Account.


Keep in mind that if you hold your ETF in a non-registered account, distributions from the ETF are included in your taxable income, whether you get them in cash or have them reinvested.



Part II — Costs, Rights and Other Information




Item 1 — Costs of Buying, Owning and Selling the ETF




1.1 — Introduction



Under the heading "How much does it cost?", state the following:


This section shows the fees and expenses you could pay to buy, own and sell [name of the class/series of securities described in the ETF facts document] [units/shares] of the ETF.

1.2 — Brokerage commissions



Under the sub-heading "Brokerage commissions", provide a brief statement using wording substantially similar to the following:


You may have to pay a commission every time you buy and sell [units/shares] of the ETF. Commissions may vary by brokerage firm. Some brokerage firms may offer commission-free ETFs or require a minimum purchase amount.



1.3 — ETF expenses



(1) Under the sub-heading "ETF expenses", include an introduction using wording similar to the following:


You don't pay these expenses directly. They affect you because they reduce the ETF's returns.

Annual rate

(as a % of the ETF's value)






Management expense ratio (MER)


This is the total of the ETF's management fee and operating expenses.

(If the ETF pays a trailing commission, state the following: "This is the total of the ETF's management fee (which includes the trailing commission) and operating expenses.")

The ETF's expenses are made up of the management fee, operating expenses and trading costs. The [class'/series'/ETF's] annual management fee is [see instruction 7]% of the [class'/series'/ETF's] value. As this [class/series/ETF] is new, operating expenses and trading costs are not yet available.


(5) If the ETF pays an incentive fee that is determined by the performance of the ETF, provide a brief statement disclosing the amount of the fee and the circumstances in which the ETF will pay it.


(6) Under the sub-heading "Trailing commission", include a description using wording substantially similar to the following:


The trailing commission is an ongoing commission. It is paid for as long as you own the ETF. It is for the services and advice that your representative and their firm provide to you.


(7) If the manager of the ETF or another member of the ETF's organization does not pay trailing commissions, include a description using wording substantially similar to the following:


This ETF doesn't have a trailing commission.


(8) If the manager of the ETF or another member of the ETF's organization pays trailing commissions, disclose the range of the rates of the trailing commission after providing a description using wording substantially similar to the following:


[Insert name of the manager of the ETF] pays the trailing commission to your representative's firm. It is paid from the ETF's management fee and is based on the value of your investment.


(9) If the manager of the ETF or another member of the ETF's organization pays trailing commissions for the class or series of securities of the ETF described in the ETF facts document but does not pay trailing commissions for another class or series of securities of the same ETF, state using wording substantially similar to the following:
