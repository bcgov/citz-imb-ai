General principles of replotting scheme





4



(1)


For the purpose of a replotting scheme, all real property in the replotting district at the initiation of the scheme forms one common mass of real property.






(2)


The real property necessary for highways, parks or public squares is to be taken from the common mass to form new parcels for those purposes, and these new parcels stand in the place of and compensate the Provincial government, the municipality and the public for the surrender of all former highways, parks or public squares.






(3)


The remainder of the common mass must be divided into new parcels for allotment to the owners in a fair and equitable manner so that, as far as possible, the value of new parcels allotted to them is equal to the value of their former parcels.






(4)


An allotment, decision, award, consent or other proceeding under this Act that affects real property is binding on and inures to the benefit of the person who owns the real property.








Allotment of parcels





5



(1)


In a replotting scheme,






(a)


effort must be made to allot to owners new parcels in approximately the same location as their former parcels, and






(b)


former parcels with buildings, other structures, erections or utilities on them, subject to the necessary adjustment of boundaries, must be returned to their former owners wherever practicable.






(2)


The allotment of new parcels in exchange for former parcels must be carried out as far as practicable with the consent of the respective owners.






(3)


If an owner does not consent,






(a)


the owner may be allotted a new parcel or parcels of value equal as nearly as possible to the value of the owner's former parcel or parcels, or






(b)


monetary compensation may be paid to the owner instead of an allotment of real property.






(4)


Unavoidable differences of value between former parcels and new parcels may be equalized by






(a)


paying monetary compensation to the owner, or






(b)


with the owner's consent or agreement, allotting to the owner a new parcel of greater value than the owner's former parcel for a cash payment or on terms.






(5)


If a new parcel is allotted under subsection (4) (b) on terms, the municipality may take a mortgage, with interest at an agreed rate, from the owner for payment of the difference in value.






(6)


Any real property not allotted as provided in subsections (1) to (5) may be allotted to any owner at an agreed price, the amount of which must be paid to the municipality.






(7)


Any real property remaining unallotted must be allotted to the municipality and is surplus real property.








Municipality may acquire charges





6



(1)


The municipality may, subject to paying compensation, acquire a charge against a former parcel and hold it as a charge against a new parcel allotted to the owner of the former parcel.






(2)


The municipality may, in respect of the charge against the new parcel, take all necessary proceedings






(a)


for the collection of the amount due under the charge, or

for the sale, transfer or realization of the security created by the charge.

the value of any surplus real property;






(d)


the new location of a building, other structure, erection or utility that is to be moved.






(2)


A replotting scheme may establish an apportionment of the net cost of the scheme between the municipality and the owners, with consideration being given to

the saving that the scheme may effect in the expenditure of the municipality for highways and municipal utilities, and






(b)


the increased taxation that may be derived by the municipality from the increased value of the real property in the replotting district.
