Interpretation





1.2



(1)


For the purposes of calculating a percentage of securities that are owned, held or under the direction of a person or company in the definition of "influential securityholder"






(a)


the determination shall be made






(i)


first, by including in the calculation only voting securities or equity securities that are outstanding, and






(ii)


second, if the person or company is not an influential securityholder by reason of a calculation under subparagraph (i), by including all voting securities or equity securities that would be outstanding if all outstanding securities that are convertible or exchangeable into voting securities or equity securities, and all outstanding rights to acquire securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for, or carry the right to acquire, voting securities or equity securities, are considered to have been converted, exchanged or exercised, as the case may be, and






(b)


securities held by a specified firm registrant in its capacity as an underwriter in the course of a distribution are considered not to be securities that the specified firm registrant holds, has the power to direct the voting of, or has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of.






(2)


A person or company is a related issuer of another person or company if






(a)


the person or company is an influential securityholder of the other person or company,






(b)


the other person or company is an influential securityholder of the person or company, or






(c)


each of them is a related issuer of the same third person or company.






(3)


Calculations of time required to be made in this Instrument in relation to a "distribution" shall be made in relation to the date on which the underwriting or agency agreement for the distribution is signed.


[am. B.C. Reg. 226/2009, Sch. H, s. 2.]








Application of Instrument





1.3



This Instrument does not apply to a distribution of






(a)


securities described in the provisions of securities legislation listed in Appendix A; or

(1)


No specified firm registrant shall act as an underwriter in a distribution of securities in which it is the issuer or selling securityholder, or as a direct underwriter in a distribution of securities of or by a connected issuer or a related issuer of the specified firm registrant, unless the distribution is made under a prospectus or another document that, in either case, contains the information specified in Appendix C.






(2)


For a distribution of special warrants or a distribution made under a prospectus no specified firm registrant shall act






(a)


as an underwriter if the specified firm registrant is the issuer or selling securityholder in the distribution; or






(b)


as a direct underwriter if a related issuer of the specified firm registrant is the issuer or selling securityholder in the distribution.






(3)


Subsection (2) does not apply to a distribution






(a)


in which






(i)


at least one specified firm registrant acting as direct underwriter acts as principal, so long as an independent underwriter underwrites not less than the lesser of






(A)


20 percent of the dollar value of the distribution, and






(B)


the largest portion of the distribution underwritten by a specified firm registrant that is not an independent underwriter, or






(ii)


each specified firm registrant acting as direct underwriter acts as agent and is not obligated to act as principal, so long as an independent underwriter receives a portion of the total agents' fees equal to an amount not less than the lesser of

20 percent of the total agents' fees for the distribution, and






(B)


the largest portion of the agents' fees paid or payable to a specified firm registrant that is not an independent underwriter; and

(ii)


the prospectus, for a distribution made under a prospectus.


[am. B.C. Reg. 226/2009, Sch. H, s. 2.]








Calculation rules





2.2



The following rules shall be followed in calculating the size of a distribution and the amount of independent underwriter involvement required for purposes of subsection 2.1 (3):






(a)


For a distribution that is made entirely in Canada, the calculation shall be based on the aggregate dollar value of securities distributed in Canada or the aggregate agents' fees relating to the distribution in Canada, and the aggregate dollar value of the distribution underwritten, or aggregate dollar value of agents' fees received, by the independent underwriter in Canada.






(b)


For a distribution that is made partly in Canada of securities of an issuer that is not a foreign issuer, the calculation shall be based on the aggregate dollar value of securities distributed in Canada and outside of Canada or the aggregate agents' fees relating to the distribution in Canada and outside of Canada, and the aggregate dollar value of the distribution underwritten, or aggregate dollar value of agents' fees received, by the independent underwriter in Canada and outside of Canada.






(c)


For a distribution that is made partly in Canada by a foreign issuer and that is not exempt from the requirements of subsection 2.1 (2) by subsection 2.1 (3) or by section 3.2, the calculation shall be based on the dollar value of securities distributed in Canada or the agents' fees relating to the distribution paid or payable in Canada, and the dollar value of the distribution underwritten, or aggregate dollar value of agents' fees received, by the independent underwriter in Canada.
