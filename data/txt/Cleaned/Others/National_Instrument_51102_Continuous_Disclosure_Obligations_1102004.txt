(1)



Significant Acquisitions

— Subject to subsection (5) and subsections 8.10 (1) and (2), an acquisition of a business or related businesses is a significant acquisition,

(b)



The Investment Test.

The reporting issuer's consolidated investments in and advances to the business or related businesses as at the acquisition date exceed 30 percent of the consolidated assets of the reporting issuer as at the last day of the most recently completed financial year of the reporting issuer ended before the acquisition date, excluding any investments in or advances to the business or related businesses as at that date.






(c)



The Profit or Loss Test.

The reporting issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated specified profit or loss of the business or related businesses exceeds 30 percent of the consolidated specified profit or loss of the reporting issuer calculated using the audited annual financial statements of each of the reporting issuer and the business or related businesses for the most recently completed financial year of each ended before the acquisition date.






(3)



Optional Significance Tests

— Despite subsection (1) and subject to subsections 8.10 (1) and 8.10 (2), if an acquisition of a business or related businesses is significant based on the significance tests in subsection (2),






(a)


a reporting issuer that is not a venture issuer may re-calculate the significance using the optional significance tests in subsection (4); and






(b)


a venture issuer may re-calculate the significance using the optional significance tests in paragraphs (4) (a) or (b) if "30 percent" is read as "100 percent".






(4)


For the purposes of subsection (3) and subject to subsections (4.1) and (4.2), the optional significance tests are:






(a)



The Asset Test.

The reporting issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated assets of the business or related businesses exceeds 30 percent of the consolidated assets of the reporting issuer, calculated using the financial statements of each of the reporting issuer and the business or the related businesses for the most recently completed interim period or financial year of each, without giving effect to the acquisition.






(b)



The Investment Test.

The reporting issuer's consolidated investments in and advances to the business or related businesses as at the acquisition date exceed 30 percent of the consolidated assets of the reporting issuer as at the last day of the most recently completed interim period or financial year of the reporting issuer, excluding any investments in or advances to the business or related businesses as at that date.






(c)



The Profit or Loss Test.

The specified profit or loss calculated under the following subparagraph (i) exceeds 30 percent of the specified profit or loss calculated under the following subparagraph (ii):

(a)


the consideration transferred for the acquisition, measured in accordance with the issuer's GAAP,






(b)


payments made in connection with the acquisition which do not constitute consideration transferred but which would not have been paid unless the acquisition had occurred, and






(c)


contingent consideration for the acquisition measured in accordance with the issuer's GAAP.






(5)


Despite subsection (1) and for the purposes of subsection (3), an acquisition of a business or related businesses is not a significant acquisition,

(7)



Application of the Profit or Loss Test if a Loss Occurred

— For the purposes of paragraphs (2) (c) and (4) (c), if any of the reporting issuer, the business or the related businesses has incurred a loss, the significance test must be applied using the absolute value of the loss from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent, adjusted to exclude income taxes.

(10)



Lower than Average Profit or Loss of the Issuer if a Loss Occurred

— If the reporting issuer's consolidated specified profit or loss for either of the two earlier financial periods referred to in subsections (8) and (9) is a loss, the reporting issuer's specified profit or loss for that period is considered to be zero for the purposes of calculating the average consolidated specified profit or loss for the three financial periods.






(11)



Application of Significance Tests — Multiple Investments in the Same Business

— If a reporting issuer has made multiple investments in the same business, then for the purposes of applying subsections (2) and (4),






(a)


if the initial investment and one or more incremental investments were made during the same financial year, the investments must be aggregated and tested on a combined basis;






(b)


if one or more incremental investments were made in a financial year subsequent to the financial year in which an initial or incremental investment was made and the initial or previous incremental investments are reflected in audited annual financial statements of the reporting issuer previously filed, the reporting issuer must apply the significance tests set out in subsections (2) and (4) on a combined basis to the incremental investments not reflected in audited financial statements of the reporting issuer previously filed; and






(c)


if one or more incremental investments were made in a financial year subsequent to the financial year in which the initial investment was made and the initial investment is not reflected in audited annual financial statements of the reporting issuer previously filed, the reporting issuer must apply the significance tests set out in subsections (2) and (4) to the initial and incremental investments on a combined basis.

Financial Information

— For the purposes of calculating the optional profit or loss test under clause (4) (c) (ii) (A), a reporting issuer may use

(a)


the reporting issuer has made a significant acquisition of a business after its most recently completed financial year; and






(b)


the previously filed document included






(i)

(15)

Part 1 — General Provisions






(a) What Is MD&A?



MD&A is a narrative explanation, through the eyes of management, of how your company performed during the period covered by the financial statements, and of your company's financial condition and future prospects. MD&A complements and supplements your financial statements, but does not form part of your financial statements.


Your objective when preparing the MD&A should be to improve your company's overall financial disclosure by giving a balanced discussion of your company's financial performance and financial condition including, without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources — openly reporting bad news as well as good news. Your MD&A should


• help current and prospective investors understand what the financial statements show and do not show;


• discuss material information that may not be fully reflected in the financial statements, such as contingent liabilities, defaults under debt, off-balance sheet financing arrangements, or other contractual obligations;


• discuss important trends and risks that have affected the financial statements, and trends and risks that are reasonably likely to affect them in the future; and


• provide information about the quality, and potential variability, of your company's profit or loss and cash flow, to assist investors in determining if past performance is indicative of future performance.





(b) Date of Information



In preparing the MD&A, you must take into account information available up to the date of the MD&A. If the date of the MD&A is not the date it is filed, you must ensure the disclosure in the MD&A is current so that it will not be misleading when it is filed.





(c) Use of "Company"



Wherever this Form uses the word "company", the term includes other types of business organizations such as partnerships, trusts and other unincorporated business entities.





(d) Explain Your Analysis



Explain the nature of, and reasons for, changes in your company's performance. Do not simply disclose the amount of change in a financial statement item from period to period. Avoid using boilerplate language. Your discussion should assist the reader to understand trends, events, transactions and expenditures.





(e) Focus on Material Information



Focus your MD&A on material information. You do not need to disclose information that is not material. Exercise your judgment when determining whether information is material.





(f) What Is Material?



Would a reasonable investor's decision whether or not to buy, sell or hold securities in your company likely be influenced or changed if the information in question was omitted or misstated? If so, the information is likely material.





(g) Venture Issuers



If your company is a venture issuer, you have the option of meeting the requirement to provide interim MD&A under section 2.2 by instead providing quarterly highlights disclosure. Refer to Companion Policy 51-102CP for guidance on quarterly highlights.


If your company is a venture issuer without significant revenue from operations, in your MD&A including any quarterly highlights, focus your discussion and analysis of financial performance on expenditures and progress towards achieving your business objectives and milestones.





(h) Reverse Takeover Transactions



If an acquisition is a reverse takeover, the MD&A should be based on the reverse takeover acquirer's financial statements.





(i) Repealed



Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 382/2010, Sch. G, s. 36 (f).]





(j) Resource Issuers



If your company has mineral projects, your disclosure must comply with National Instrument 43-101

Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects

, including the requirement that all scientific and technical disclosure be based on a technical report or other information prepared by or under the supervision of a qualified person.


If your company has oil and gas activities, your disclosure must comply with National Instrument 51-101

Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities

.





(k) Numbering and Headings



The numbering, headings and ordering of items included in this Form are guidelines only. You do not need to include the headings or numbering or follow the order of items in this Form. Disclosure provided in response to any item need not be repeated elsewhere.





(l) Omitting Information



You do not need to respond to any item in this Form that is inapplicable.





(m) Defined Terms



If a term is used but not defined in this Form, refer to Part 1 of National Instrument 51-102 and to National Instrument 14-101

Definitions

. If a term is used in this Form and is defined in both the securities statute of the local jurisdiction and in National Instrument 51-102, refer to section 1.4 of Companion Policy 51-102CP for further guidance.


This Form also uses accounting terms that are defined or used in Canadian GAAP applicable to publicly accountable enterprises. For further guidance, see subsections 1.4 (7) and (8) of Companion Policy 51-102CP.





(n) Plain Language



Write the MD&A so that readers are able to understand it. Refer to the plain language principles listed in section 1.5 of Companion Policy 51-102CP for further guidance. If you use technical terms, explain them in a clear and concise manner.





(o) Available Prior Period Information



If you have not presented comparative financial information in your financial statements, in your MD&A you must provide prior period information relating to financial performance that is available.





(p) Use of "Financial Condition"



This Form uses the term "financial condition". Financial condition reflects the overall health of the company and includes your company's financial position (as shown on the statement of financial position) and other factors that may affect your company's liquidity, capital resources and solvency.

(d) the nature and amounts of any other obligations or liabilities arising from the arrangement that could require your company to provide funding under the arrangement and the triggering events or circumstances that could cause them to arise; and


(e) any known event, commitment, trend or uncertainty that may affect the availability or benefits of the arrangement (including any termination) and the course of action that management has taken, or proposes to take, in response to any such circumstances.



INSTRUCTIONS




(i) Off-balance sheet arrangements include any contractual arrangement with an entity not reported on a consolidated basis with your company, under which your company has




(A) any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;




(B) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for the assets;




(C) any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or




(D) any obligation held by your company in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to your company, or engages in leasing, hedging activities or research and development services with your company.




(ii) Contingent liabilities arising out of litigation, arbitration or regulatory actions are not considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements.




(iii) Disclosure of off-balance sheet arrangements should cover the most recently completed financial year. However, the discussion should address changes from the previous year where such discussion is necessary to understand the disclosure.




(iv) The discussion need not repeat information provided in the notes to the financial statements if the discussion clearly cross-references to specific information in the relevant notes and integrates the substance of the notes into the discussion in a manner that explains the significance of the information not included in the MD&A.






1.9  Transactions Between Related Parties



Discuss all transactions between related parties as defined by the issuer's GAAP.



INSTRUCTION




In discussing your company's transactions between related parties, your discussion should include both qualitative and quantitative characteristics that are necessary for an understanding of the transactions' business purpose and economic substance. You should discuss

(B) the business purpose of the transaction;




(C) the recorded amount of the transaction and describe the measurement basis used; and

1.10  Fourth Quarter



Discuss and analyze fourth quarter events or items that affected your company's financial condition, financial performance or cash flows, year-end and other adjustments, seasonal aspects of your company's business and dispositions of business segments.

1.11  Proposed Transactions



Discuss the expected effect on financial condition, financial performance and cash flows of any proposed asset or business acquisition or disposition if your company's board of directors, or senior management who believe that confirmation of the decision by the board is probable, have decided to proceed with the transaction.

INSTRUCTION




You do not have to disclose this information if, under section 7.1 of National Instrument 51-102, your company has filed a Form 51-102F3 Material Change Report regarding the transaction on a confidential basis and the report remains confidential.






1.12  Critical Accounting Estimates



If your company is not a venture issuer, provide an analysis of your company's critical accounting estimates. Your analysis should

(ii) the methodology used in determining the critical accounting estimate;


(iii) the assumptions underlying the accounting estimate that relate to matters highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made;

(e) identify the reportable segments of your company's business that the accounting estimate affects and discuss the accounting estimate on a reportable segment basis, if your company operates in more than one reportable segment.



INSTRUCTIONS




(i) An accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate only if




(A) it requires your company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and




(B) different estimates that your company could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on your company's financial condition, changes in financial condition or financial performance.




(ii) As part of your description of each critical accounting estimate, in addition to qualitative disclosure, you should provide quantitative disclosure when quantitative information is reasonably available and would provide material information for investors. Similarly, in your discussion of assumptions underlying an accounting estimate that relates to matters highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, you should provide quantitative disclosure when it is reasonably available and it would provide material information for investors. For example, quantitative information may include a sensitivity analysis or disclosure of the upper and lower ends of the range of estimates from which the recorded estimate was selected.






1.13  Changes in Accounting Policies Including Initial Adoption



Discuss and analyze any changes in your company's accounting policies, including

(i) describe the events or transactions that gave rise to the initial adoption of an accounting policy;

(iii) discuss the effect resulting from the initial adoption of the accounting policy on your company's financial position, changes in financial position and financial performance;


(iv) if your company is permitted a choice among acceptable accounting policies,


(A) state that you made a choice among acceptable alternatives;


(B) identify the alternatives;

INSTRUCTIONS




(i) "Other instruments" are instruments that may be settled by the delivery of non-financial assets. A commodity futures contract is an example of an instrument that may be settled by delivery of non-financial assets.




(ii) Your discussion under paragraph 1.14 (a) should enhance a reader's understanding of the significance of recognized and unrecognized instruments on your company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The information should also assist a reader in assessing the amounts, timing, and certainty of future cash flows associated with those instruments. Also discuss the relationship between liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments.




(iii) For purposes of paragraph 1.14 (c), if your company is exposed to significant price, credit or liquidity risks, consider providing a sensitivity analysis or tabular information to help readers assess the degree of exposure. For example, an analysis of the effect of a hypothetical change in the prevailing level of interest or currency rates on the fair value of financial instruments and future profit or loss and cash flows may be useful in describing your company's exposure to price risk.




(iv) For purposes of paragraph 1.14 (d), disclose and explain the revenue, expenses, gains and losses from hedging activities separately from other activities.

Interim MD&A must update your company's annual MD&A for all disclosure required by Item 1 except section 1.3. This disclosure must include


(a) a discussion of your analysis of


(i) current quarter and year-to-date results including a comparison of financial performance to the corresponding periods in the previous year;

2.2.1 Quarterly Highlights



If your company is a venture issuer, you have the option of meeting the requirement to provide interim MD&A under section 2.2 by instead providing a short discussion of all material information about your company's operations, liquidity and capital resources.


Include in your discussion:


• an analysis of your company's financial condition, financial performance and cash flows and any significant factors that have caused period to period variations in those measures;


• known trends, risks or demands;


• major operating milestones;


• commitments, expected or unexpected events, or uncertainties that have materially affected your company's operations, liquidity and capital resources in the interim period or are reasonably likely to have a material effect going forward;


• any significant changes from disclosure previously made about how the company was going to use proceeds from any financing and an explanation of variances;


• any significant transactions between related parties that occurred in the interim period.



INSTRUCTIONS




(i) If the first MD&A you file in this Form (your first MD&A) is an interim MD&A, you cannot use quarterly highlights. Rather, you must provide all the disclosure called for in Item 1 in your first MD&A. Base the disclosure, except the disclosure for section 1.3, on your interim financial report. Since you do not have to update the disclosure required in section 1.3 in your interim MD&A, your first MD&A will provide disclosure under section 1.3 based on your annual financial statements.




(ii) Provide a short, focused discussion that gives a balanced and accurate picture of the company's business activities during the interim period. The purpose of the quarterly highlights reporting is to provide a brief narrative update about the business activities, financial condition, financial performance and cash flow of the company. While summaries are to be clear and concise, they are subject to the normal prohibitions against false and misleading statements.




(iii) Quarterly highlights prepared in accordance with section 2.2.1 are not required for your company's fourth quarter as relevant fourth quarter content will be contained in your company's annual MD&A prepared in accordance with Item 1 (see section 1.10).




(iv) You must title your quarterly highlights "Interim MD&A — Quarterly Highlights".




(v) If there was a change to the company's accounting policies during the interim period, include a description of the material effects resulting from the change.

Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings

and, as applicable, Form 52-109F2

Certification of Interim Filings — Full Certificate

or Form 52-109F2R

Certification of Refiled Interim Filings

.



INSTRUCTIONS




(i) If the first MD&A you file in this Form (your first MD&A) is an interim MD&A, you must provide all the disclosure called for in Item 1 in your first MD&A. Base the disclosure, except the disclosure for section 1.3, on your interim financial report. Since you do not have to update the disclosure required in section 1.3 in your interim MD&A, your first MD&A will provide disclosure under section 1.3 based on your annual financial statements. Your subsequent interim MD&A for that year will update your first interim MD&A.




(ii) For the purposes of paragraph 2.2 (b), you may assume the reader has access to your annual MD&A or your first MD&A. You do not have to duplicate the discussion and analysis of financial condition in your annual MD&A or your first MD&A. For example, if economic and industry factors are substantially unchanged you may make a statement to this effect.




(iii) For the purposes of subparagraph 2.2 (a) (i), you should generally give prominence to the current quarter.




(iv) In discussing your company's statement of financial position conditions or profit or loss or cash flow items for an interim period, you do not have to present a summary, in tabular form, of all known contractual obligations contemplated under section 1.6. Instead, you should disclose material changes in the specified contractual obligations during the interim period.




(v) Interim MD&A prepared in accordance with Item 2 is not required for your company's fourth quarter as relevant fourth quarter content will be contained in your company's annual MD&A prepared in accordance with Item 1 (see section 1.10).




(vi) In your interim MD&A, update the summary of quarterly results in section 1.5 by providing summary information for the eight most recently completed quarters.




(vii) Your annual MD&A may not include all the information in Item 1 if you were a venture issuer as at the end of your last financial year. If you ceased to be a venture issuer during your interim period, you do not have to restate the MD&A you previously filed. Instead, provide the disclosure for the additional sections in Item 1 that you were exempt from as a venture issuer in the next interim MD&A you file. Base your disclosure for those sections on your interim financial report.

Part 1 — General Provisions






(a) What Is an AIF?



An AIF (annual information form) is required to be filed annually by certain companies under Part 6 of National Instrument 51-102. An AIF is a disclosure document intended to provide material information about your company and its business at a point in time in the context of its historical and possible future development. Your AIF describes your company, its operations and prospects, risks and other external factors that impact your company specifically.


This disclosure is supplemented throughout the year by subsequent continuous disclosure filings including news releases, material change reports, business acquisition reports, financial statements and management discussion and analysis.





(b) Date of Information



Unless otherwise specified in this Form, the information in your AIF must be presented as at the last day of your company's most recently completed financial year. If necessary, you must update the information in the AIF so it is not misleading when it is filed. For information presented as at any date other than the last day of your company's most recently completed financial year, specify the relevant date in the disclosure.





(c) Use of "Company"



Wherever this Form uses the word "company", the term includes other types of business organizations such as partnerships, trusts and other unincorporated business entities.


All references to "your company" in Items 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15 and 16 of this Form apply collectively to your company, your company's subsidiaries, joint ventures to which your company is a party and entities in which your company has an investment accounted for by the equity method.





(d) Focus on Material Information



Focus your AIF on material information. You do not need to disclose information that is not material. Exercise your judgment when determining whether information is material. However, you must disclose all corporate and individual cease trade orders, bankruptcies, penalties and sanctions in accordance with Item 10 and section 12.2 of this Form.





(e) What Is Material?



Would a reasonable investor's decision whether or not to buy, sell or hold securities in your company likely be influenced or changed if the information in question was omitted or misstated? If so, the information is likely material.





(f) Incorporating Information by Reference



You may incorporate information required to be included in your AIF by reference to another document, other than a previous AIF. Clearly identify the referenced document or any excerpt of it that you incorporate into your AIF. Unless you have already filed the referenced document or excerpt, including any documents incorporated by reference into the document or excerpt, under your SEDAR profile, you must file it with your AIF. You must also disclose that the document is on SEDAR at

www.sedar.com.






(g) Defined Terms



If a term is used but not defined in this Form, refer to Part 1 of National Instrument 51-102 and to National Instrument 14-101

This Form also uses accounting terms that are defined or used in Canadian GAAP applicable to publicly accountable enterprises. For further guidance, see subsections 1.4 (7) and (8) of Companion Policy 51-102CP.





(h) Plain Language



Write the AIF so that readers are able to understand it. Refer to the plain language principles listed in section 1.5 of Companion Policy 51-102CP for further guidance. If you use technical terms, explain them in a clear and concise manner.





(i) Special Purpose Entities



If your company is a special purpose entity, you may have to modify the disclosure items in this Form to reflect the special purpose nature of your company's business.





(j) Numbering and Headings



The numbering, headings and ordering of items included in this Form are guidelines only. You do not need to include the headings or numbering or follow the order of items in this Form. Disclosure provided in response to any item need not be repeated elsewhere.

However, a sender of a dissident circular shall include in the dissident circular the disclosure required by section 14.2 if the sender of the dissident circular is proposing a significant acquisition or restructuring transaction under which securities of the sender or securities of an affiliate of the sender are to be changed, exchanged, issued or distributed.

INSTRUCTION

(1) All compensation to be included



(a) When completing this form, the company must disclose all compensation paid, payable, awarded, granted, given, or otherwise provided, directly or indirectly, by the company, or a subsidiary of the company, to each NEO and director, in any capacity, including, for greater certainty, all plan and non-plan compensation, direct and indirect pay, remuneration, economic or financial award, reward, benefit, gift or perquisite paid, payable, awarded, granted, given, or otherwise provided to the NEO or director for services provided and for services to be provided, directly or indirectly, to the company or a subsidiary of the company.

(ii) any cash, securities, similar instruments or any other property received by an NEO, or by a director, under these plans.


(c) For greater certainty, the plans described in paragraph (b) include plans that provide for such benefits after retirement.


(d) If an item of compensation is not specifically mentioned or described in this form, it is to be disclosed in column (h) ("All other compensation") of the summary compensation table in section 3.1.



(2) Departures from format



(a) Although the required disclosure must be made in accordance with this form, the disclosure may


(i) omit a table, column of a table, or other prescribed information, if it does not apply, and


(ii) add a table, column, or other information if


(A) necessary to satisfy the objective in section 1.1, and


(B) to a reasonable person, the table, column, or other information does not detract from the prescribed information in the summary compensation table in section 3.1.


(b) Despite paragraph (a), a company must not add a column in the summary compensation table in section 3.1.



(3) Information for full financial year



If an NEO acted in that capacity for the company during part of the financial year for which disclosure is required in the summary compensation table, provide details of all of the compensation that the NEO received from the company for that financial year. This includes compensation the NEO earned in any other position with the company during the financial year.


Do not annualize compensation in a table for any part of a year when an NEO was not in the service of the company. Annualized compensation may be disclosed in a footnote.



(4) External management companies



(a) If one or more individuals acting as an NEO of the company are not employees of the company, disclose the names of those individuals.


(b) If an external management company employs or retains one or more individuals acting as NEOs or directors of the company and the company has entered into an understanding, arrangement or agreement with the external management company to provide executive management services to the company directly or indirectly, disclose any compensation that:


(i) the company paid directly to an individual employed, or retained by the external management company, who is acting as an NEO or director of the company; and


(ii) the external management company paid to the individual that is attributable to the services they provided to the company directly or indirectly.


(c) If an external management company provides the company's executive management services and also provides executive management services to another company, disclose the entire compensation the external management company paid to the individual acting as an NEO or director, or acting in a similar capacity, in connection with services the external management company provided to the company, or the parent or a subsidiary of the company. If the management company allocates the compensation paid to an NEO or director, disclose the basis or methodology used to allocate this compensation.



Commentary




An NEO may be employed by an external management company and provide services to the company under an understanding, arrangement or agreement. In this case, references in this form to the CEO or CFO are references to the individuals who performed similar functions to that of the CEO or CFO. They are generally the same individuals who signed and filed annual and interim certificates to comply with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings.




(5) Director and NEO compensation



Disclose any compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to each director and NEO, in any capacity with respect to the company. Compensation to directors and NEOs must include all compensation from the company and its subsidiaries.


Disclose any compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to, an NEO, or director, in any capacity with respect to the company, by another person or company.



(6) Determining if an individual is an NEO



For the purpose of calculating total compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to an individual under paragraph (c) of the definition of NEO,


(a) use the total compensation that would be reported under column (i) of the summary compensation table required by section 3.1 for each executive officer, as if that executive officer were an NEO for the company's most recently completed financial year, and


(b) exclude from the calculation,


(i) any compensation that would be reported under column (g) of the summary compensation table required by section 3.1,


(ii) any incremental payments, payables, and benefits to an executive officer that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario listed in section 6.1 that occurred during the most recently completed financial year, and


(iii) any cash compensation that relates to foreign assignments that is specifically intended to offset the impact of a higher cost of living in the foreign location, and is not otherwise related to the duties the executive officer performs for the company.



Commentary




The $150,000 threshold in paragraph (c) of the definition of NEO applies only when determining who is an NEO in a company's most recently completed financial year. If an individual is an NEO in the most recently completed financial year, disclosure of compensation in prior years must be provided if otherwise required by this form even if total compensation in a prior year is less than $150,000 in that year.




(7) Compensation to associates



Disclose any awards, earnings, payments, or payables to an associate of an NEO, or of a director, as a result of compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to the NEO or the director, in any capacity with respect to the company.



(8) New reporting issuers



(a) Subject to paragraph (b) and subsection 3.1 (1), disclose information in the summary compensation table for the three most recently completed financial years since the company became a reporting issuer.


(b) Do not provide information for a completed financial year if the company was not a reporting issuer at any time during the most recently completed financial year, unless the company became a reporting issuer as a result of a restructuring transaction.


(c) If the company was not a reporting issuer at any time during the most recently completed financial year and the company is completing the form because it is preparing a prospectus, discuss all significant elements of the compensation to be awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to NEOs of the company once it becomes a reporting issuer, to the extent this compensation has been determined.



Commentary




1. Unless otherwise specified, information required to be disclosed under this form may be prepared in accordance with the accounting principles the company uses to prepare its financial statements, as permitted by National Instrument 52-107 Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards.




2. The definition of "director" under securities legislation includes an individual who acts in a capacity similar to that of a director.




(9) Currencies



Companies must report amounts required by this form in Canadian dollars or in the same currency that the company uses for its financial statements. A company must use the same currency in the tables in sections 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2 and 7.1 of this form.


If compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to an NEO was in a currency other than the currency reported in the prescribed tables of this form, state the currency in which compensation was awarded, earned, paid, or payable, disclose the currency exchange rate and describe the methodology used to translate the compensation into Canadian dollars or the currency that the company uses in its financial statements.



(10) Plain language



Information required to be disclosed under this form must be clear, concise, and presented in such a way that it provides a reasonable person an understanding of


(a) how decisions about NEO and director compensation are made, and


(b) how specific NEO and director compensation relates to the overall stewardship and governance of the company.



Commentary




Refer to the plain language principles listed in section 1.5 of Companion Policy 51-102CP Continuous Disclosure Obligations for further guidance.






Item 2 — Compensation Discussion and Analysis






2.1  Compensation discussion and analysis




(1)

Describe and explain all significant elements of compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to NEOs for the most recently completed financial year. Include the following:


(a) the objectives of any compensation program or strategy;


(b) what the compensation program is designed to reward;


(c) each element of compensation;


(d) why the company chooses to pay each element;


(e) how the company determines the amount (and, where applicable, the formula) for each element; and


(f) how each element of compensation and the company's decisions about that element fit into the company's overall compensation objectives and affect decisions about other elements.



(2)

If applicable, describe any new actions, decisions or policies that were made after the end of the most recently completed financial year that could affect a reasonable person's understanding of an NEO's compensation for the most recently completed financial year.



(3)

If applicable, clearly state the benchmark and explain its components, including the companies included in the benchmark group and the selection criteria.



(4)

If applicable, disclose performance goals or similar conditions that are based on objective, identifiable measures, such as the company's share price or earnings per share. If performance goals or similar conditions are subjective, the company may describe the performance goal or similar condition without providing specific measures.


If the company discloses performance goals or similar conditions that are non-GAAP financial measures, explain how the company calculates these performance goals or similar conditions from its financial statements.



Exemption



The company is not required to disclose performance goals or similar conditions in respect of specific quantitative or qualitative performance-related factors if a reasonable person would consider that disclosing them would seriously prejudice the company's interests.


For the purposes of this exemption, a company's interests are not considered to be seriously prejudiced solely by disclosing performance goals or similar conditions if those goals or conditions are based on broad corporate-level financial performance metrics which include earnings per share, revenue growth, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.


This exemption does not apply if it has publicly disclosed the performance goals or similar conditions.


If the company is relying on this exemption, state this fact and explain why disclosing the performance goals or similar conditions would seriously prejudice the company's interests.


If the company does not disclose specific performance goals or similar conditions, state what percentage of the NEO's total compensation relates to this undisclosed information and how difficult it could be for the NEO, or how likely it will be for the company, to achieve the undisclosed performance goal or similar condition.



(5)

Disclose whether or not the board of directors, or a committee of the board, considered the implications of the risks associated with the company's compensation policies and practices. If the implications were considered, disclose the following:


(a) the extent and nature of the board of directors' or committee's role in the risk oversight of the company's compensation policies and practices;


(b) any practices the company uses to identify and mitigate compensation policies and practices that could encourage an NEO or individual at a principal business unit or division to take inappropriate or excessive risks;


(c) any identified risks arising from the company's compensation policies and practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.



(6)

Disclose whether or not an NEO or director is permitted to purchase financial instruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds, that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director.



Commentary




1. The information disclosed under section 2.1 will depend on the facts. Provide enough analysis to allow a reasonable person to understand the disclosure elsewhere in this form. Describe the significant principles underlying policies and explain the decisions relating to compensation provided to an NEO. Disclosure that merely describes the process for determining compensation or compensation already awarded, earned, paid, or payable is not adequate. The information contained in this section should give readers a sense of how compensation is tied to the NEO's performance. Avoid boilerplate language.




2. If the company's process for determining executive compensation is very simple, for example, the company relies solely on board discussion without any formal objectives, criteria and analysis, then make this clear in the discussion.




3. If the company used any benchmarking in determining compensation or any element of compensation, include the benchmark group and describe why the benchmark group and selection criteria are considered by the company to be relevant.




4. The following are examples of items that will usually be significant elements of disclosure concerning compensation:




• contractual or non-contractual arrangements, plans, process changes or any other matters that might cause the amounts disclosed for the most recently completed financial year to be misleading if used as an indicator of expected compensation levels in future periods;




• the process for determining perquisites and personal benefits;




• policies and decisions about the adjustment or recovery of awards, earnings, payments, or payables if the performance goal or similar condition on which they are based is restated or adjusted to reduce the award, earning, payment, or payable;




• the basis for selecting events that trigger payment for any arrangement that provides for payment at, following or in connection with any termination or change of control;




• any waiver or change to any specified performance goal or similar condition to payout for any amount, including whether the waiver or change applied to one or more specified NEOs or to all compensation subject to the performance goal or similar condition;




• whether the board of directors can exercise a discretion, either to award compensation absent attainment of the relevant performance goal or similar condition or to reduce or increase the size of any award or payout, including if they exercised discretion and whether it applied to one or more named executive officers;




• whether the company will be making any significant changes to its compensation policies and practices in the next financial year;




• the role of executive officers in determining executive compensation; and




• performance goals or similar conditions in respect of specific quantitative or qualitative performance-related factors for NEOs.



5. The following are examples of situations that could potentially encourage an executive officer to expose the company to inappropriate or excessive risks:


• compensation policies and practices at a principal business unit of the company or a subsidiary of the company that are structured significantly differently than others within the company;


• compensation policies and practices for certain executive officers that are structured significantly differently than other executive officers within the company;


• compensation policies and practices that do not include effective risk management and regulatory compliance as part of the performance metrics used in determining compensation;


• compensation policies and practices where the compensation expense to executive officers is a significant percentage of the company's revenue;


• compensation policies and practices that vary significantly from the overall compensation structure of the company;


• compensation policies and practices where incentive plan awards are awarded upon accomplishment of a task while the risk to the company from that task extends over a significantly longer period of time;


• compensation policies and practices that contain performance goals or similar conditions that are heavily weighed to short-term rather than long-term objectives;


• incentive plan awards that do not provide a maximum benefit or payout limit to executive officers.


The examples above are not exhaustive and the situations to consider will vary depending upon the nature of the company's business and the company's compensation policies and practices.



2.2 Performance graph



(a) This section does not apply to


(i) venture issuers,


(ii) companies that have distributed only debt securities or non-convertible, non-participating preferred securities to the public, and


(iii) companies that were not reporting issuers in any jurisdiction in Canada for at least 12 calendar months before the end of their most recently completed financial year, other than companies that became new reporting issuers as a result of a restructuring transaction.


(b) Provide a line graph showing the company's cumulative total shareholder return over the five most recently completed financial years. Assume that $100 was invested on the first day of the five-year period. If the company has been a reporting issuer for less than five years, use the period that the company has been a reporting issuer.


Compare this to the cumulative total return of at least one broad equity market index that, to a reasonable person, would be an appropriate reference point for the company's return. If the company is included in the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index, use that index. In all cases, assume that dividends are reinvested.


Discuss how the trend shown by this graph compares to the trend in the company's compensation to executive officers reported under this form over the same period.



Commentary




For section 2.2, companies may also include other relevant performance goals or similar conditions.






2.3  Share-based and option-based awards



Describe the process the company uses to grant share-based or option-based awards to executive officers. Include the role of the compensation committee and executive officers in setting or amending any equity incentive plan under which a share-based or option-based award is granted. State whether previous grants are taken into account when considering new grants.





2.4  Compensation governance




(1)

Describe any policies and practices adopted by the board of directors to determine the compensation for the company's directors and executive officers.



(2)

If the company has established a compensation committee


(a) disclose the name of each committee member and, in respect of each member, state whether or not the member is independent or not independent,


(b) disclose whether or not one or more of the committee members has any direct experience that is relevant to his or her responsibilities in executive compensation,


(c) describe the skills and experience that enable the committee to make decisions on the suitability of the company's compensation policies and practices, and


(d) describe the responsibilities, powers and operation of the committee.



(3)

If a compensation consultant or advisor has, at any time since the company's most recently completed financial year, been retained to assist the board of directors or the compensation committee in determining compensation for any of the company's directors or executive officers


(a) state the name of the consultant or advisor and a summary of the mandate the consultant or advisor has been given,


(b) disclose when the consultant or advisor was originally retained,


(c) if the consultant or advisor has provided any services to the company, or to its affiliated or subsidiary entities, or to any of its directors or members of management, other than or in addition to compensation services provided for any of the company's directors or executive officers,


(i) state this fact and briefly describe the nature of the work, and


(ii) disclose whether the board of directors or compensation committee must pre-approve other services the consultant or advisor, or any of its affiliates, provides to the company at the request of management, and


(d) for each of the two most recently completed financial years, disclose,


(i) under the caption "Executive Compensation-Related Fees", the aggregate fees billed by each consultant or advisor, or any of its affiliates, for services related to determining compensation for any of the company's directors and executive officers, and


(ii) under the caption "All Other Fees", the aggregate fees billed for all other services provided by each consultant or advisor, or any of its affiliates, that are not reported under subparagraph (i) and include a description of the nature of the services comprising the fees disclosed under this category.



Commentary




For section 2.4, a director is independent if he or she would be independent within the meaning of section 1.4 of National Instrument 52-110 Audit Committees.

Commentary




Under subsection (1), a company is not required to disclose comparative period disclosure in accordance with the requirements of either Form 51-102F6 Statement of Executive Compensation, which came into force on March 30, 2004, as amended, or this form, in respect of a financial year ending before December 31, 2008.




(2)

In column (c), include the dollar value of cash and non-cash base salary an NEO earned during a financial year covered in the table (a covered financial year). If the company cannot calculate the amount of salary earned in a financial year, disclose this in a footnote, along with the reason why it cannot be determined. Restate the salary figure the next time the company prepares this form, and explain what portion of the restated figure represents an amount that the company could not previously calculate.



(3)

In column (d), disclose the dollar amount based on the fair value of the award on the grant date for a covered financial year.



(4)

In column (e), disclose the dollar amount based on the fair value of the award on the grant date for a covered financial year. Include option-based awards both with or without tandem share appreciation rights.



(5)

For an award disclosed in column (d) or (e), in a narrative after the table,


(a) describe the methodology used to calculate the fair value of the award on the grant date, disclose the key assumptions and estimates used for each calculation, and explain why the company chose that methodology, and


(b) if the fair value of the award on the grant date is different from the fair value determined in accordance with IFRS 2

Share-based Payment

(accounting fair value), state the amount of the difference and explain the reasons for the difference.



Commentary




1. This commentary applies to subsections (3), (4) and (5).




2. The value disclosed in columns (d) and (e) of the summary compensation table should reflect what the company paid, made payable, awarded, granted, gave or otherwise provided as compensation on the grant date (fair value of the award) as set out in comment 3, below. This value might differ from the value reported in the issuer's financial statements.




3. While compensation practices vary, there are generally two approaches that boards of directors use when setting compensation. A board of directors may decide the value in securities of the company to be awarded or paid as compensation. Alternatively, a board of directors may decide the portion of the potential ownership of the company to be transferred as compensation. A fair value ascribed to the award will normally result from these approaches.




A company may calculate this value either in accordance with a valuation methodology identified in IFRS 2 Share-based Payment or in accordance with another methodology set out in comment 5 below.




4. In some cases, the fair value of the award disclosed in columns (d) and (e) might differ from the accounting fair value. For financial statement purposes, the accounting fair value amount is amortized over the service period to obtain an accounting cost (accounting compensation expense), adjusted at year end as required.




5. While the most commonly used methodologies for calculating the value of most types of awards are the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the binomial lattice model, companies may choose to use another valuation methodology if it produces a more meaningful and reasonable estimate of fair value.




6. The summary compensation table requires disclosure of an amount even if the accounting compensation expense is zero. The amount disclosed in the table should reflect the fair value of the award following the principles described under comments 2 and 3, above.




7. Column (d) includes common shares, restricted shares, restricted share units, deferred share units, phantom shares, phantom share units, common share equivalent units, stock, and similar instruments that do not have option-like features.




(6)

In column (e), include the incremental fair value if, at any time during the covered financial year, the company has adjusted, amended, cancelled, replaced or significantly modified the exercise price of options previously awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to, an NEO. The repricing or modification date must be determined in accordance with IFRS 2

Share-based Payment

. The methodology used to calculate the incremental fair value must be the same methodology used to calculate the initial grant.


This requirement does not apply to any repricing that equally affects all holders of the class of securities underlying the options and that occurs through a pre-existing formula or mechanism in the plan or award that results in the periodic adjustment of the option exercise or base price, an antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a recapitalization or similar transaction.



(7)

Include a footnote to the table quantifying the incremental fair value of any adjusted, amended, cancelled, replaced or significantly modified options that are included in the table.



(8)

In column (f), include the dollar value of all amounts earned for services performed during the covered financial year that are related to awards under non-equity incentive plans and all earnings on any such outstanding awards.


(a) If the relevant performance goal or similar condition was satisfied during a covered financial year (including for a single year in a plan with a multi-year performance goal or similar condition), report the amounts earned for that financial year, even if they are payable at a later date. The company is not required to report these amounts again in the summary compensation table when they are actually paid to an NEO.


(b) Include a footnote describing and quantifying all amounts earned on non-equity incentive plan compensation, whether they were paid during the financial year, were payable but deferred at the election of an NEO, or are payable by their terms at a later date.


(c) Include any discretionary cash awards, earnings, payments, or payables that were not based on pre-determined performance goals or similar conditions that were communicated to an NEO. Report any performance-based plan awards that include pre-determined performance goals or similar conditions in column (f).


(d) In column (f1), include annual non-equity incentive plan compensation, such as bonuses and discretionary amounts. For column (f1), annual non-equity incentive plan compensation relates only to a single financial year. In column (f2), include all non-equity incentive plan compensation related to a period longer than one year.



(9)

In column (g), include all compensation relating to defined benefit or defined contribution plans. These include service costs and other compensatory items such as plan changes and earnings that are different from the estimated earnings for defined benefit plans and above-market earnings for defined contribution plans.


This disclosure relates to all plans that provide for the payment of pension plan benefits. Use the same amounts included in column (e) of the defined benefit plan table required by Item 5 for the covered financial year and the amounts included in column (c) of the defined contribution plan table as required by Item 5 for the covered financial year.



(10)

In column (h), include all other compensation not reported in any other column of this table. Column (h) must include, but is not limited to:


(a) perquisites, including property or other personal benefits provided to an NEO that are not generally available to all employees, and that in aggregate are worth $50,000 or more, or are worth 10% or more of an NEO's total salary for the financial year. Value these items on the basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the company and its subsidiaries. Describe in a footnote the methodology used for computing the aggregate incremental cost to the company.


State the type and amount of each perquisite the value of which exceeds 25% of the total value of perquisites reported for an NEO in a footnote to the table. Provide the footnote information for the most recently completed financial year only;


(b) other post-retirement benefits such as health insurance or life insurance after retirement;


(c) all "gross-ups" or other amounts reimbursed during the covered financial year for the payment of taxes;


(d) the incremental payments, payables, and benefits to an NEO that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario listed in section 6.1 that occurred before the end of the covered financial year;


(e) the dollar value of any insurance premiums paid or payable by, or on behalf of, the company during the covered financial year for personal insurance for an NEO if the estate of the NEO is the beneficiary;


(f) the dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid or payable on share-based or option-based awards that were not factored into the fair value of the award on the grant date required to be reported in columns (d) and (e);


(g) any compensation cost for any security that the NEO bought from the company or its subsidiaries at a discount from the market price of the security (through deferral of salary, bonus or otherwise). Calculate this cost at the date of purchase and in accordance with IFRS 2

Share-based Payment

;


(h) above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is deferred on a basis that is not tax exempt other than for defined contribution plans covered in the defined contribution plan table in Item 5. Above-market or preferential applies to non-registered plans and means a rate greater than the rate ordinarily paid by the company or its subsidiary on securities or other obligations having the same or similar features issued to third parties; and


(i) any company contribution to a personal savings plan like a registered retirement savings plan made on behalf of the NEO.



Commentary




1. Generally, there will be no incremental payments, payables, and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario described in section 6.1 that occurred before the end of a covered financial year for compensation that has been reported in the summary compensation table for the most recently completed financial year or for a financial year before the most recently completed financial year.




If the vesting or payout of the previously reported compensation is accelerated, or a performance goal or similar condition in respect of the previously reported compensation is waived, as a result of a scenario described in section 6.1, the incremental payments, payables, and benefits should include the value of the accelerated benefit or of the waiver of the performance goal or similar condition.




2. Generally, an item is not a perquisite if it is integrally and directly related to the performance of an executive officer's duties. If something is necessary for a person to do his or her job, it is integrally and directly related to the job and is not a perquisite, even if it also provides some amount of personal benefit.




If the company concludes that an item is not integrally and directly related to performing the job, it may be a perquisite if the item provides an NEO with any direct or indirect personal benefit. If it does provide a personal benefit, the item is a perquisite, whether or not it is provided for a business reason or for the company's convenience, unless it is generally available on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees.




Companies must conduct their own analysis of whether a particular item is a perquisite. The following are examples of things that are often considered perquisites or personal benefits. This list is not exhaustive:




• Cars, car lease and car allowance;




• Corporate aircraft or personal travel financed by the company;




• Jewellery;




• Clothing;




• Artwork;




• Housekeeping services;




• Club membership;




• Theatre tickets;




• Financial assistance to provide education to children of executive officers;




• Parking;




• Personal financial or tax advice;




• Security at personal residence or during personal travel; and




• Reimbursements of taxes owed with respect to perquisites or other personal benefit.




(11)

In column (i), include the dollar value of total compensation for the covered financial year. For each NEO, this is the sum of the amounts reported in columns (c) through (h).



(12)

Any deferred amounts must be included in the appropriate column for the covered financial year in which they are earned.



(13)

If an NEO elected to exchange any compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to the NEO in a covered financial year under a program that allows the NEO to receive awards, earnings, payments, or payables in another form, the compensation the NEO elected to exchange must be reported as compensation in the column appropriate for the form of compensation exchanged: Do not report it in the form in which it was or will be received by the NEO. State in a footnote the form of awards, earnings, payments, or payables substituted for the compensation the NEO elected to exchange.





3.2  Narrative discussion



Describe and explain any significant factors necessary to understand the information disclosed in the summary compensation table required by section 3.1.



Commentary




The significant factors described in section 3.2 will vary depending on the circumstances of each award but may include:




• the significant terms of each NEO's employment agreement or arrangement;




• any repricing or other significant changes to the terms of any share-based or option-based award program during the most recently completed financial year; and




• the significant terms of any award reported in the summary compensation table, including a general description of the formula or criterion to be applied in determining the amounts payable and the vesting schedule. For example, if dividends will be paid on shares, state this, the applicable dividend rate and whether that rate is preferential.






3.3  Repealed



Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 180/2011, Sch. s. 11.]





3.4  Officers who also act as directors



If an NEO is also a director who receives compensation for services as a director, include that compensation in the summary compensation table and include a footnote explaining which amounts relate to the director role. Do not provide disclosure for that NEO under Item 7.





Item 4 — Incentive Plan Awards






4.1  Outstanding share-based awards and option-based awards




(1)

Complete this table for each NEO for all awards outstanding at the end of the most recently completed financial year. This includes awards granted before the most recently completed financial year.

(4)

In column (d), disclose the expiration date for each option under each award reported in column (b).



(5)

In column (e), disclose the aggregate dollar amount of in-the-money unexercised options held at the end of the year. Calculate this amount based on the difference between the market value of the securities underlying the instruments at the end of the year, and the exercise or base price of the option.



(6)

In column (f), disclose the total number of shares or units that have not vested.



(7)

In column (g), disclose the aggregate market value or payout value of share-based awards that have not vested.


If the share-based award provides only for a single payout on vesting, calculate this value based on that payout.


If the share-based award provides for different payouts depending on the achievement of different performance goals or similar conditions, calculate this value based on the minimum payout. However, if the NEO achieved a performance goal or similar condition in a financial year covered by the share-based award that on vesting could provide for a payout greater than the minimum payout, calculate this value based on the payout expected as a result of the NEO achieving this performance goal or similar condition.



(8)

In column (h), disclose the aggregate market value or payout value of vested share-based awards that have not yet been paid out or distributed.

In column (b), disclose the aggregate dollar value that would have been realized if the options under the option-based award had been exercised on the vesting date. Compute the dollar value that would have been realized by determining the difference between the market price of the underlying securities at exercise and the exercise or base price of the options under the option-based award on the vesting date. Do not include the value of any related payment or other consideration provided (or to be provided) by the company to or on behalf of an NEO.



(3)

In column (c), disclose the aggregate dollar value realized upon vesting of share-based awards. Compute the dollar value realized by multiplying the number of shares or units by the market value of the underlying shares on the vesting date. For any amount realized upon vesting for which receipt has been deferred, include a footnote that states the amount and the terms of the deferral.





4.3  Narrative discussion



Describe and explain the significant terms of all plan-based awards, including non-equity incentive plan awards, issued or vested, or under which options have been exercised, during the year, or outstanding at the year end, to the extent not already discussed under sections 2.1, 2.3 and 3.2. The company may aggregate information for different awards, if separate disclosure of each award is not necessary to communicate their significant terms.



Commentary




The items included in the narrative required by section 4.3 will vary depending on the terms of each plan, but may include:




• the number of securities underlying each award or received on vesting or exercise;




• general descriptions of formulae or criteria that are used to determine amounts payable;




• exercise prices and expiry dates;




• dividend rates on share-based awards;




• whether awards are vested or unvested;




• performance goals or similar conditions, or other significant conditions;




• information on estimated future payouts for non-equity incentive plan awards (performance goals or similar conditions and maximum amounts); and




• the closing market price on the grant date, if the exercise or base price is less than the closing market price of the underlying security on the grant date.

In columns (b) and (c), the disclosure must be as of the end of the company's most recently completed financial year. In columns (d) through (g), the disclosure must be as of the reporting date used in the company's audited annual financial statements for the most recently completed financial year.



(3)

In column (b), disclose the number of years of service credited to an NEO under the plan. If the number of years of credited service in any plan is different from the NEO's number of actual years of service with the company, include a footnote that states the amount of the difference and any resulting benefit augmentation, such as the number of additional years the NEO received.



(4)

In column (c), disclose


(a) the annual lifetime benefit payable at the end of the most recently completed financial year in column (c1) based on years of credited service reported in column (b) and actual pensionable earnings as at the end of the most recently completed financial year. For the purposes of this calculation, the company must assume that the NEO is eligible to receive payments or benefits at year end, and


(b) the annual lifetime benefit payable at age 65 in column (c2) based on years of credited service as of age 65 and actual pensionable earnings through the end of the most recently completed financial year, as per column (c1).



Commentary




For the purposes of quantifying the annual lifetime benefit payable at the end of the most recently completed financial year in column (c1), the company may calculate the annual lifetime benefit payable as follows:







annual benefits payable at the presumed retirement age used to calculate the closing present value of the defined benefit obligation



×



years of credited service at year end











years of credited service at the presumed retirement age







The company may calculate the annual lifetime benefit payable in accordance with another formula if the company reasonably believes that it produces a more meaningful calculation of the annual lifetime benefit payable at year end.




(5)

In column (d), disclose the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the start of the most recently completed financial year.



(6)

In column (e), disclose the compensatory change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the most recently completed financial year. This includes service cost net of employee contributions plus plan changes and differences between actual and estimated earnings, and any additional changes that have retroactive impact, including, for greater certainty, a change in valuation assumptions as a consequence of an amendment to benefit terms.


Disclose the valuation method and all significant assumptions the company applied in quantifying the closing present value of the defined benefit obligation. The company may satisfy all or part of this disclosure by referring to the disclosure of assumptions in its financial statements, footnotes to the financial statements or discussion in its management's discussion and analysis.



(7)

In column (f), disclose the non-compensatory changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the company's most recently completed financial year. Include all items that are not compensatory, such as changes in assumptions other than those already included in column (e) because they were made as a consequence of an amendment to benefit terms, employee contributions and interest on the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the start of the most recently completed financial year.



(8)

In column (g), disclose the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the most recently completed financial year.





5.2  Defined contribution plans table




(1)

Complete this table for all pension plans that provide for payments or benefits at, following or in connection with retirement, excluding defined benefit plans. For all disclosure in this table, use the same assumptions and methods used for financial statement reporting purposes under the accounting principles used to prepare the company's financial statements, as permitted by National Instrument 52-107

In column (c), disclose the employer contribution and above-market or preferential earnings credited on employer and employee contributions. Above-market or preferential earnings applies to non-registered plans and means a rate greater than the rate ordinarily paid by the company or its subsidiary on securities or other obligations having the same or similar features issued to third parties.

(4)

In column (d), disclose the accumulated value at the end of the most recently completed financial year.



Commentary




1. For pension plans that provide the maximum of: (i) the value of a defined benefit pension; and (ii) the accumulated value of a defined contribution pension, companies should disclose the global value of the pension plan in the defined benefit plans table under section 5.1.




For pension plans that provide the sum of a defined benefit component and a defined contribution component, companies should disclose the respective components of the pension plan. The defined benefit component should be disclosed in the defined benefit plans table under section 5.1 and the defined contribution component should be disclosed in the defined contribution plans table under section 5.2.




2. Any contributions by the company or a subsidiary of the company to a personal savings plan like a registered retirement savings plan made on behalf of the NEO must still be disclosed in column (h) of the summary compensation table, as required by paragraph 3.1 (10) (i).






5.3  Narrative discussion



Describe and explain for each retirement plan in which an NEO participates, any significant factors necessary to understand the information disclosed in the defined benefit plan table in section 5.1 and the defined contribution plan table in section 5.2.



Commentary




Significant factors described in the narrative required by section 5.3 will vary, but may include:




• the significant terms and conditions of payments and benefits available under the plan, including the plan's normal and early retirement payment, benefit formula, contribution formula, calculation of interest credited under the defined contribution plan and eligibility standards;




• provisions for early retirement, if applicable, including the name of the NEO and the plan, the early retirement payment and benefit formula and eligibility standards. Early retirement means retirement before the normal retirement age as defined in the plan or otherwise available under the plan;




• the specific elements of compensation (e.g., salary, bonus) included in applying the payment and benefit formula. If a company provides this information, identify each element separately; and




• company policies on topics such as granting extra years of credited service, including an explanation of who these arrangements relate to and why they are considered appropriate.






5.4  Deferred compensation plans



Describe the significant terms of any deferred compensation plan relating to each NEO, including:


(a) the types of compensation that can be deferred and any limitations on the extent to which deferral is permitted (by percentage of compensation or otherwise);


(b) significant terms of payouts, withdrawals and other distributions; and


(c) measures for calculating interest or other earnings, how and when these measures may be changed, and whether an NEO or the company chose these measures. Quantify these measures wherever possible.





Item 6 — Termination and Change of Control Benefits






6.1  Termination and change of control benefits




(1)

For each contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for payments to an NEO at, following or in connection with any termination (whether voluntary, involuntary or constructive), resignation, retirement, a change in control of the company or a change in an NEO's responsibilities, describe, explain, and where appropriate, quantify the following items:


(a) the circumstances that trigger payments or the provision of other benefits, including perquisites and pension plan benefits;


(b) the estimated incremental payments, payables, and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, each circumstance, including timing, duration and who provides the payments and benefits;


(c) how the payment and benefit levels are determined under the various circumstances that trigger payments or provision of benefits;


(d) any significant conditions or obligations that apply to receiving payments or benefits. This includes but is not limited to, non-compete, non-solicitation, non-disparagement or confidentiality agreements. Include the term of these agreements and provisions for waiver or breach; and


(e) any other significant factors for each written contract, agreement, plan or arrangement.



(2)

Disclose the estimated incremental payments, payables, and benefits even if it is uncertain what amounts might be paid in given circumstances under the various plans and arrangements, assuming that the triggering event took place on the last business day of the company's most recently completed financial year. For valuing share-based awards or option-based awards, use the closing market price of the company's securities on that date.


If the company is unsure about the provision or amount of payments or benefits, make a reasonable estimate (or a reasonable estimate of the range of amounts) and disclose the significant assumptions underlying these estimates.



(3)

Despite subsection (1), the company is not required to disclose the following:


(a) Perquisites and other personal benefits if the aggregate of this compensation is less than $50,000. State the individual perquisites and personal benefits as required by paragraph 3.1 (10) (a).


(b) Information about possible termination scenarios for an NEO whose employment terminated in the past year. The company must only disclose the consequences of the actual termination.


(c) Information in respect of a scenario described in subsection (1) if there will be no incremental payments, payables, and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, that scenario.



Commentary




1. Subsection (1) does not require the company to disclose notice of termination without cause, or compensation in lieu thereof, which are implied as a term of an employment contract under common law or civil law.




2. Item 6 applies to changes of control regardless of whether the change of control results in termination of employment.




3. Generally, there will be no incremental payments, payables, and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario described in subsection (1) for compensation that has been reported in the summary compensation table for the most recently completed financial year or for a financial year before the most recently completed financial year.




If the vesting or payout of the previously reported compensation is accelerated, or a performance goal or similar condition in respect of the previously reported compensation is waived, as a result of a scenario described in subsection (1), the incremental payments, payables, and benefits should include the value of the accelerated benefit or of the waiver of the performance goal or similar condition.




4. A company may disclose estimated incremental payments, payables and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario described in subsection (1), in a tabular format.

(a) In column (a), do not include a director who is also an NEO if his or her compensation for service as a director is fully reflected in the summary compensation table and elsewhere in this form. If an NEO is also a director who receives compensation for his or her services as a director, reflect the director compensation in the summary compensation table required by section 3.1 and provide a footnote to this table indicating that the relevant disclosure has been provided under section 3.4.


(b) In column (b), include all fees awarded, earned, paid, or payable in cash for services as a director, including annual retainer fees, committee, chair, and meeting fees.


(c) In column (g), include all compensation paid, payable, awarded, granted, given, or otherwise provided, directly or indirectly, by the company, or a subsidiary of the company, to a director in any capacity, under any other arrangement.

In a footnote to the table, disclose these amounts and describe the nature of the services provided by the director that are associated with these amounts.


(d) In column (g), include programs where the company agrees to make donations to one or more charitable institutions in a director's name, payable currently or upon a designated event such as the retirement or death of the director. Include a footnote to the table disclosing the total dollar amount payable under the program.





7.2  Narrative discussion



Describe and explain any factors necessary to understand the director compensation disclosed in section 7.1.



Commentary




Significant factors described in the narrative required by section 7.2 will vary, but may include:




• disclosure for each director who served in that capacity for any part of the most recently completed financial year;




• standard compensation arrangements, such as fees for retainer, committee service, service as chair of the board or a committee, and meeting attendance;




• any compensation arrangements for a director that are different from the standard arrangements, including the name of the director and a description of the terms of the arrangement; and




• any matters discussed in the compensation discussion and analysis that do not apply to directors in the same way that they apply to NEOs such as practices for granting option-based awards.






7.3  Share-based awards, option-based awards and non-equity incentive plan compensation



Provide the same disclosure for directors that is required under Item 4 for NEOs.

Item 1 — General Provisions






1.1 Objective



All direct and indirect compensation provided to certain executive officers and directors for, or in connection with, services they have provided to the company or a subsidiary of the company must be disclosed in this form.


The objective of this disclosure is to communicate the compensation the company paid, made payable, awarded, granted, gave or otherwise provided to each named executive officer and director for the financial year, and the decision-making process relating to compensation. This disclosure will provide insight into executive compensation as a key aspect of the overall stewardship and governance of the company and will help investors understand how decisions about executive compensation are made.


A company's executive compensation disclosure under this form must satisfy this objective and subsections 9.3.1 (1) or 11.6 (1) of the Instrument.


While the objective of this disclosure is the same as the objective in section 1.1 of Form 51-102F6, this form is to be used by venture issuers only.  Reporting issuers that are not venture issuers must complete Form 51-102F6.





1.2 Definitions



If a term is used in this form but is not defined in this section, refer to subsection 1.1 (1) of the Instrument or to National Instrument 14-101

(c) in respect of the company and its subsidiaries, the most highly compensated executive officer other than the individuals identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) at the end of the most recently completed financial year whose total compensation was more than $150,000, as determined in accordance with subsection 1.3 (5), for that financial year;


(d) each individual who would be a named executive officer under paragraph (c) but for the fact that the individual was not an executive officer of the company, and was not acting in a similar capacity, at the end of that financial year;



"plan"

includes any plan, contract, authorization, or arrangement, whether or not set out in any formal document, where cash, compensation securities or any other property may be received, whether for one or more persons;



"underlying securities"

means any securities issuable on conversion, exchange or exercise of compensation securities.





1.3 Preparing the form




(1) All compensation to be included



(a) When completing this form, the company must disclose all compensation paid, payable, awarded, granted, given, or otherwise provided, directly or indirectly, by the company, or a subsidiary of the company, to each named executive officer and director, in any capacity, including, for greater certainty, all plan and non-plan compensation, direct and indirect pay, remuneration, economic or financial award, reward, benefit, gift or perquisite paid, payable, awarded, granted, given, or otherwise provided to the named executive officer or director for services provided and for services to be provided, directly or indirectly, to the company or a subsidiary of the company.


(b) If an item of compensation is not specifically mentioned or described in this form, disclose it in the column "Value of all other compensation" of the table in section 2.1.



Commentary




1. Unless otherwise specified, information required to be disclosed under this form may be prepared in accordance with the accounting principles the company uses to prepare its financial statements, as permitted by National Instrument 52-107 Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards.




2. The definition of "director" under securities legislation includes an individual who acts in a capacity similar to that of a director.




(2) Departures from format



(a) Although the required disclosure must be made in accordance with this form, the disclosure may


(i) omit a table, column of a table, or other prescribed information, if it does not apply, and


(ii) add a table, column, or other information if


(A) necessary to satisfy the objective in section 1.1, and


(B) to a reasonable person, the table, column, or other information does not detract from the prescribed information in the table in section 2.1.


(b) Despite paragraph (a), a company must not add a column to the table in section 2.1.



(3) Information for full financial year



(a) If a named executive officer acted in that capacity for the company during part of a financial year for which disclosure is required in the table in section 2.1, provide details of all of the compensation that the named executive officer received from the company for that financial year. This includes compensation the named executive officer earned in any other position with the company during the financial year.


(b) Do not annualize compensation in a table for any part of a year when a named executive officer was not in the service of the company. Annualized compensation may be disclosed in a footnote.



(4) Director and named executive officer compensation



(a) Disclose any compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to each director and named executive officer, in any capacity with respect to the company. Compensation to directors and named executive officers must include all compensation from the company and its subsidiaries.


(b) Disclose any compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to, a named executive officer, or director, in any capacity with respect to the company, by another person or company.



(5) Determining if an individual is a named executive officer



For the purpose of calculating total compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to an executive officer under paragraph (c) of the definition of named executive officer,


(a) use the total compensation that would be reported for that executive officer in the table in section 2.1, as if the executive officer were a named executive officer for the company's most recently completed financial year, and


(b) exclude any compensation disclosed in the column "Value of all other compensation" of the table in section 2.1.



Commentary




The $150,000 threshold in paragraph (c) of the definition of named executive officer only applies when determining who is a named executive officer in a company's most recently completed financial year. If an individual is a named executive officer in the most recently completed financial year, disclosure of compensation in the prior years must be provided even if total compensation in a prior year is less than $150,000.




(6) Compensation to associates



Disclose any awards, earnings, payments, or payables to an associate of a named executive officer, or of a director, as a result of compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to the named executive officer or the director, in any capacity with respect to the company.



(7) Currencies



(a) Companies must report amounts required by this form in Canadian dollars or in the same currency that the company uses for its financial statements. A company must use the same currency in all of the tables of this form.


(b) If compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to a named executive officer or director was in a currency other than the currency reported in the prescribed tables of this form, state the currency in which compensation was awarded, earned, paid, or payable, disclose the currency exchange rate and describe the methodology used to translate the compensation into Canadian dollars or the currency that the company uses in its financial statements.



(8) New reporting issuers



(a) A company is not required to provide information for a completed financial year if the company was not a reporting issuer at any time during the most recently completed financial year, unless the company became a reporting issuer as a result of a restructuring transaction.


(b) If the company was not a reporting issuer at any time during the most recently completed financial year and the company is completing this form because it is preparing a prospectus, discuss all significant elements of the compensation to be awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to named executive officers and directors of the company once it becomes a reporting issuer, to the extent this compensation has been determined.



(9) Plain language



Information required to be disclosed under this form must be clear, concise, and presented in such a way that it provides a person, applying reasonable effort, an understanding of


(a) how decisions about named executive officer and director compensation are made, and


(b) how specific named executive officer and director compensation relates to the overall stewardship and governance of the company.

(2) In the table required under subsection (1), disclose compensation of each named executive officer first, followed by compensation of any director who is not a named executive officer.


(3) If the individual is a named executive officer and a director, state both positions in the column entitled "Name and position". In a footnote to the table, identify how much compensation the NEO received for each position.


(4) In the column entitled "Value of perquisites", include perquisites provided to an NEO or director that are not generally available to all employees and that, in aggregate, are greater than


(a) $15,000, if the NEO or director's total salary for the financial year is $150,000 or less,


(b) 10% of the NEO or director's salary for the financial year, if the NEO or director's total salary for the financial year is greater than $150,000 but less than $500,000, or


(c) $50,000, if the NEO or director's total salary for the financial year is $500,000 or greater.


Value these items on the basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the company and its subsidiaries. Describe in a footnote the methodology used for computing the aggregate incremental cost to the company.


Provide a note to the table to disclose the nature of each perquisite provided that equals or exceeds 25% of the total value of perquisites provided to that named executive officer or director, and how the value of the perquisite was calculated, if it is not provided in cash.



Commentary




For the purposes of the column entitled "Value of perquisites", an item is generally a perquisite if it is not integrally and directly related to the performance of the director or named executive officer's duties. If something is necessary for a person to do his or her job, it is integrally and directly related to the job and is not a perquisite, even if it also provides some amount of personal benefit.



(5) If non-cash compensation, other than compensation required to be disclosed in section 2.3, was provided or is payable, disclose the fair market value of the compensation at the time it was earned or, if it is not possible to calculate the fair market value, disclose that fact in a note to the table and the reasons why.


(6) In the column entitled "Value of all other compensation", include all of the following:


(a) any incremental payments, payables and benefits to a named executive officer or director that were triggered by, or resulted from, a scenario listed in subsection 2.5 (2) that occurred before the end of the applicable financial year,


(b) all compensation relating to defined benefit or defined contribution plans including service costs and other compensatory items such as plan changes and earnings that are different from the estimated earnings for defined benefit plans and above market earnings for defined contribution plans.



Commentary




The disclosure of defined benefit or defined contribution plans relates to all plans that provide for the payment of pension plan benefits. Use the same amounts indicated in column (e) of the defined benefit plan table required by section 2.7 for the applicable financial year and the amounts included in column (c) of the defined contribution plan table required by section 2.7 for the applicable financial year.



(7) Despite subsection (1), it is not necessary to disclose Canada Pension Plan, similar government plans and group life, health, hospitalization, medical reimbursement and relocation plans that do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation that are generally available to all salaried employees.


(8) If a director or named executive officer has served in that capacity for only part of a year, indicate the number of months he or she has served; do not annualize the compensation.


(9) Provide notes to the table to disclose each of the following for the most recently completed financial year only:


(a) compensation paid or payable by any person or company other than the company in respect of services provided to the company or its subsidiaries, including the identity of that other person or company;


(b) compensation paid or payable indirectly to the director or named executive officer and, in such case, the amount of compensation, to whom it is paid or payable and the relationship between the director or named executive officer and such other person or company;


(c) for the column entitled "Value of all other compensation", the nature of each form of other compensation paid or payable that equals or exceeds 25% of the total value of other compensation paid or payable to that director or named executive officer, and how the value of such other compensation was calculated, if it is not paid or payable in cash.





2.2 External management companies



(1) If one or more individuals acting as named executive officers of the company are not employees of the company, disclose the names of those individuals.


(2) If an external management company employs or retains one or more individuals acting as named executive officers or directors of the company and the company has entered into an understanding, arrangement or agreement with the external management company to provide executive management services to the company, directly or indirectly, disclose any compensation that


(a) the company paid directly to an individual employed, or retained by the external management company, who is acting as a named executive officer or director of the company;


(b) the external management company paid to the individual that is attributable to the services they provided to the company, directly or indirectly.


(3) If an external management company provides the company's executive management services and also provides executive management services to another company, disclose the entire compensation the external management company paid to the individual acting as a named executive officer or director, or acting in a similar capacity, in connection with services the external management company provided to the company, or the parent or a subsidiary of the company. If the management company allocates the compensation paid to a named executive officer or director, disclose the basis or methodology used to allocate this compensation.



Commentary




A named executive officer may be employed by an external management company and provide services to the company under an understanding, arrangement or agreement. In this case, references in this form to the chief executive officer or chief financial officer are references to the individuals who performed similar functions to that of the chief executive officer or chief financial officer. They are typically the same individuals who signed and filed annual and interim certificates to comply with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings.






2.3 Stock options and other compensation securities



(1) Using the following table, disclose all compensation securities granted or issued to each director and named executive officer by the company or one of its subsidiaries in the most recently completed financial year for services provided or to be provided, directly or indirectly, to the company or any of its subsidiaries.

(c) any vesting provisions of the compensation securities;
