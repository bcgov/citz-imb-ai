(6)


The officers of the defaulting municipality shall, for all purposes connected with the carrying into effect, or permitting or assisting the receiver to carry into effect, the provisions of this Act with respect to the striking, levying, and collecting of the said rate, be deemed to be officers of the Court appointing the receiver, and as such shall be amenable to the Court, and may be proceeded against by attachment, or otherwise, to compel them to perform their duties hereby imposed upon them.
