EXPLANATION TO CLIENTS AND CLIENT RESPONSE FORM







Note:




Terms used in this Form have the meanings given to them in National Instrument 54-101. The use of this Form is referenced in sections 1.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 of National Instrument 54-101.







EXPLANATION TO CLIENTS



[Letterhead of Intermediary]


Based on your instructions, the securities in your account with us are not registered in your name but in our name or the name of another person or company holding your securities on our behalf. The issuers of the securities in your account may not know the identity of the beneficial owner of these securities.


We are required under securities law to obtain your instructions concerning various matters relating to your holding of securities in your account.



Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership Information



Securities law permits reporting issuers and other persons and companies to send materials related to the affairs of the reporting issuer directly to beneficial owners of the reporting issuer's securities if the beneficial owner does not object to having information about it disclosed to the reporting issuer or other persons and companies. Part 1 of the client response form allows you to tell us if you

OBJECT

to the disclosure by us to the reporting issuer or other persons or companies of your beneficial ownership information, consisting of your name, address, electronic mail address, securities holdings and preferred language of communication. Securities legislation restricts the use of your beneficial ownership information to matters relating to the affairs of the reporting issuer.


If you

DO NOT OBJECT

to the disclosure of your beneficial ownership information, please mark the first box in Part 1 of the form. In those circumstances, you will not be charged with any costs associated with sending securityholder materials to you.


If you

OBJECT

to the disclosure of your beneficial ownership information by us, please mark the second box in Part 1 of the form. If you do this, all materials to be delivered to you as a beneficial owner of securities will be delivered by us.

[

Instruction:

Disclose particulars of any fees or charges that the intermediary may require an objecting beneficial owner to pay in connection with the sending of securityholder materials.]




Receiving Securityholder Materials



For securities that you hold through your account, you have the right to receive proxy-related materials sent by reporting issuers to registered holders of their securities in connection with meetings of such securityholders. Among other things, this permits you to receive the necessary information to allow you to have your securities voted in accordance with your instructions at a securityholder meeting.

[

Optional:

Revise this paragraph, if appropriate, to state that objecting beneficial owners will not receive materials unless they or the relevant issuers bear the costs.]



In addition, reporting issuers may choose to send other securityholder materials to beneficial owners, although they are not obliged to do so.


Securities law permits you to decline to receive securityholder materials. The three types of materials that you may decline to receive are:


(a) proxy-related materials, including annual reports and financial statements, that are sent in connection with a securityholder meeting;


(b) annual reports and financial statements that are not part of proxy-related materials; and


(c) materials that a reporting issuer or other person or company sends to securityholders that are not required by corporate or securities law to be sent to registered holders.


Part 2 of the client response form allows you to receive all materials sent to beneficial owners of securities or to decline to receive the three types of materials referred to above.


If you want to receive

ALL

materials that are sent to beneficial owners of securities, please mark the first box on Part 2 of the enclosed client response form. If you want to

DECLINE

to receive the three types of materials referred to above, please mark the second box in Part 2 of the form.


(

Note:

Even if you decline to receive the three types of materials referred to above, a reporting issuer or other person or company is entitled to deliver these materials to you, provided that the reporting issuer or other person or company pays all costs associated with the sending of these materials. These materials would be delivered to you through your intermediary if you have objected to the disclosure of your beneficial ownership information to reporting issuers.)



Preferred Language of Communication



Part 3 of the client response form allows you to tell us your preferred language of communication (English or French). You will receive materials in your preferred language of communication if the materials are available in that language.



Electronic Delivery of Documents



Securities law permits us to deliver some documents by electronic means if the consent of the recipient to the means of delivery has been obtained. Please provide your electronic mail address if you have one.



[

Instruction:

If applicable, either (1) state if the client wishes to receive documents by electronic delivery from the intermediary, the client should complete, sign and return an enclosed consent form with the client response form or (2) inform the client that electronic delivery of documents by the intermediary may be available upon his or her consent, and provide information as to how the client may provide that consent.]
