Profile requirements




4

(1)


Before a person or company transmits a document through SEDAR+ for the
first time, the person or company must file a profile by transmitting
it through SEDAR+.




(2)

If information contained in a profile becomes inaccurate, the person
or company must file an updated profile with the accurate information
by transmitting it through SEDAR+ at the earlier of




(a)

the next time the person or company transmits a document through
SEDAR+ after the date on which the person or company knew or

through SEDAR+ a Form 45-106F1
Report of Exempt Distribution
, and the person or company does not have a head office in Canada or
