NOTE TO READER



In contrast to the certificate required for non-venture issuers under National
Instrument 52-109

Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim
Filings

(NI 52-109), this Venture Issuer Basic Certificate does not include
representations relating to the establishment and maintenance of disclosure controls and
procedures (DC&P) and internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), as defined in NI
52-109. In particular, the certifying officers filing this certificate are not making any
representations relating to the establishment and maintenance of


i) controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the issuer in its annual filings, interim filings
or other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities legislation;
and


ii) a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with the issuer's GAAP.


The issuer's certifying officers are responsible for ensuring that processes
are in place to provide them with sufficient knowledge to support the representations they
are making in this certificate. Investors should be aware that inherent limitations on the
ability of certifying officers of a venture issuer to design and implement on a cost
effective basis DC&P and ICFR as defined in NI 52-109 may result in additional risks to
the quality, reliability, transparency and timeliness of interim and annual filings and
other reports provided under securities legislation.
