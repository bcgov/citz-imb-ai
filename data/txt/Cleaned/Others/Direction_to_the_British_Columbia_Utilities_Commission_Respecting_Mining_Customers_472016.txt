(1)


Within 10 days of the date of an application by the authority for the purposes of this section, the commission must issue an order so that the authority's Electric Tariff Supplement No. 5 is amended by adding a supplement that






(a)


applies only to a mining customer who,






(i)


as an eligible customer, requests that the supplement apply respecting amounts that will be payable to the authority for electricity service provided for the operation of an applicable mine that is, on the date of the request, a producing mine, and






(ii)


has no overdue bills with the authority on the date of the request,






(b)


subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), requires a mining customer, for each bill issued during the application period, to pay an adjusted amount, in Canadian dollars, calculated as follows:





adjusted amount = SA + (SA x AP)










where






SA is the amount that would have been payable under rate schedule 1823 but for the application of the supplement;






AP is, subject to the Rule below, the applicable of the following adjustment amounts:










AP for a mining customer

settlement price calculated for a mining customer who operates a copper mine is the average of the daily settlement price of copper, in pounds, as reported by the London Metal Exchange, for the settlement price period, converted into Canadian currency by using the Bank of Canada's average daily closing exchange rate over that period;






settlement price calculated for a mining customer who operates a coal mine is the average of the daily settlement price of Hard Coking Coal (Premium Low Vol) FOB Australia, in tonnes, as reported by Platts (Coal Trader International), for the settlement price period, converted into Canadian currency by using the Bank of Canada's average daily closing exchange rate over that period;

(c)


provides that if a mining customer's account balance, once adjusted to subtract amounts representing interest, is, on the date the authority issues a bill to the mining customer, equal to 75% of the service price, the mining customer must pay






(i)


the amounts required under rate schedule 1823 instead of the adjusted amounts, if the AP calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) is less than zero, and






(ii)


the adjusted amount, if the AP calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) is zero or more,






(d)


provides that if a mining customer's account balance is, on the date a bill is issued to the mining customer, equal to zero, the mining customer must pay






(i)


the amounts required under rate schedule 1823 instead of the adjusted amounts, if the AP calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) is zero or more, and






(ii)


the adjusted amount, if the AP calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) is less than zero,






(e)

(f)

(i)


prime plus 5% for the mining customers operating a mine referred to in paragraphs (a) to (g) and (i) to (m) of the definition of "applicable mine" in section 1;






(ii)


12% for the mining customer operating the mine referred to in paragraph (h) of the definition of "applicable mine" in section 1, and






(g)


on request by a mining customer, allows the authority to cease applying the supplement to amounts payable by the mining customer, if at the time of the request the mining customer's account balance is zero.






(2)


The commission must allow the authority






(a)


to establish a regulatory account to defer to future fiscal years of the authority amounts equal to the sum of the following:






(i)


the account balances of mining customers, if those account balances are impaired;
