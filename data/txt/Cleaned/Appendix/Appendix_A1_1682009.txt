AND TAKE NOTICE THAT:



(1) Before obtaining the foregoing grant or resealing, the applicant may be granted an authorization to obtain estate information or an authorization to obtain resealing information, as the case may be, in relation to that grant or resealing for the purposes of obtaining financial information in relation to the grant or resealing.


(2) You have a right to oppose, by filing a notice of dispute in accordance with Rule 25-10 (1),


(a) if the intended application is for an estate grant, the granting of either or both of an authorization to obtain estate information and the estate grant, or

(6) After the applicant has filed a submission for estate grant or submission for resealing, you may apply for an order requiring the applicant to provide security unless the applicant is the Public Guardian and Trustee.

If an authorization to obtain resealing information issues to the applicant, the applicant may apply for the resealing of the foreign grant without further notice to you.


(9) If a grant issues to the applicant, the applicant must provide, if there is a will, to the beneficiaries or, if there is no will, to intestate successors of the deceased, an accounting as to how the estate was administered and how the estate assets were distributed, and if a foreign grant is resealed as a result of the application, the intended applicant must provide, if there is a will, to the beneficiaries or, if there is no will, to intestate successors of the deceased, an accounting as to how the estate comprising the assets to which the resealed grant applies was administered and how those assets were distributed.


[

If this notice of proposed application is required to be delivered to the Public Guardian and Trustee under Rule 25-2, ensure all additional information required under Rule 25-2 (13) is provided to the Public Guardian and Trustee.
