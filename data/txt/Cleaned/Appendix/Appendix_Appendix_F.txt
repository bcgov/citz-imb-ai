(iii) clear the Area of the Works and keep it cleared of all or any part of any obstruction, improvement or other matter which, in the reasonable opinion of Hydro or TELUS, does or might interfere with or endanger the Works, disrupt service to Hydro's or TELUS's customers, or pose a hazard to persons or property in relation to the Works; and


(iv) clear the Area of the Works and keep it cleared (including pruning or removal) of all or any part of any trees or growth which do or might, in the opinion of Hydro or TELUS, interfere with or endanger the Works, disrupt service to Hydro's or TELUS's customers, or pose a hazard to persons or property in relation to the Works;


(c) to enjoy further rights as follows:


(i) Hydro and TELUS may, with the prior approval of the Grantor and any party with a registered interest in the affected areas, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, cut trees or growth outside the Area of the Works, if in the reasonable opinion of Hydro or TELUS such trees or growth might interfere with or endanger the Works (whether on or off the Lands) or pose a hazard to persons or property in relation to the Works;


(ii) Hydro and TELUS may pass and repass over, and maintain, repair replace and use, all roads, lanes and bridges on the Lands outside of the Area of the Works with or without equipment, machinery and materials to such extent as may reasonably be required by Hydro or TELUS in relation to this Agreement;


(iii) if there are no suitable roads, lanes or bridges under paragraph 2.1 (c) (ii), Hydro and TELUS may either:


A. construct, maintain, repair, replace and pass and repass over roads, lanes or bridges on the Lands; or


B. pass and repass over the Lands elsewhere than on roads, lanes and bridges, with or without equipment, machinery and materials to such extent as may reasonably be required by Hydro or TELUS in relation to this Agreement, subject to prior approval of the route by the Grantor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hydro and TELUS do not require such approval if there is an emergency or a reasonably apprehended emergency or for the determination of electricity consumption, but will act reasonably and report to the Grantor the purpose and extent of the access as soon as practicable;


(iv) to conduct vegetation management upon the Area of the Works, such as the planting of vegetation compatible with the undertakings of Hydro or TELUS, and the application of herbicides and pesticides with the consent of the Grantor, provided that Hydro and TELUS will not conduct any aerial application of herbicides or pesticides on the Lands;

(vi) to ground any structures, installation or things, by whomsoever owned, from time to time situated anywhere on the Right of Way Area or adjacent Lands where, in the reasonable opinion of Hydro and TELUS, such grounding will eliminate or reduce hazards to persons or property in relation to the Works;


(vii) Hydro and TELUS may enter onto the Lands outside the Area of the Works for the purpose of undertaking works to protect any Works located within the Lands or within an Excluded Right of Way Area or to protect persons or property that may be at risk from such Works, provided that:


A. Hydro or TELUS will before commencing such works deliver to the Grantor for approval a written work plan describing the proposed work on the Lands;


B. the Grantor will not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay approval of such work plan, and shall take into consideration the effect of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to the cost of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not undertaking the work.

C. Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will pay compensation for any damage to the Lands resulting from the implementation of the work plan;


D. if Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, determines in its reasonable judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are imminent safety concerns, Hydro and TELUS may, without approval of the Grantor, undertake works and take such steps on the Lands as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to protect the Works, or to protect persons or property that may be at risk from the Works, and in that event Hydro or TELUS will as soon as reasonably possible thereafter notify the Grantor; and


(d) generally, do all such other acts or things as may reasonably be necessary or incidental to the business of Hydro or TELUS in connection with any of the above.



RIGHT OF WAY AREA



3.1 The Right of Way Area consists of:


(a) all portions of the Lands reasonably required for the following:

7.1 Prior to undertaking construction on the Lands of any new Works which are not alterations, extensions or additions to existing Works, Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, will deliver to the Grantor for prior approval, a sketch plan showing with reasonable accuracy the location of such new Works, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.



RELOCATION OF HYDRO AND TELUS WORKS DUE TO CHANGE



8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way Area or an Excluded Right of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works, then the Grantor will, at no cost to Hydro and TELUS, consent to the relocation and replacement of such Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:

14.0 NUISANCE

Document 6. Tla'amin Nation Upland Owner Consent



TO:

Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia

, as represented by the Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations ("British Columbia")


FROM:

Tla'amin Nation

("Tla'amin")


WHEREAS:


A. Tla'amin is the [registered] owner in fee simple of the land located ........................................, legally described as [INSERT LEGAL DESCRIPTION] (the "Upland"); [Note: Insert Legal Description for area immediately adjacent to foreshore. If Upland is not in LTO then describe land as accurately as possible];


B. British Columbia is the owner in fee simple of the parcel or tract of land being the foreshore fronting on the Upland and all land covered by water adjoining the Upland (the "Foreshore");


C. The Upland and Foreshore are adjacent to each other and Tla'amin, as owner of the Upland, is entitled to exercise its riparian right of access to the Upland by crossing the Foreshore;


D. British Columbia wishes to interfere with Tla'amin's riparian right of access to the Upland by authorizing, under an existing licence of occupation (the "Licence"), the use of the identified portions of the Foreshore for the purpose of constructing, using and maintaining a floating residential home for non-commercial use on the portion of the Foreshore shown outlined in bold on the attached Schedule "A" ("Float Home Area") pursuant to a licence dated for reference • and numbered•, which has a term expiring •; and


E. Tla'amin is prepared to consent to such interference pursuant to the provisions set out below.


NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of ONE ($1.00) dollar and other good and valuable consideration, now paid by British Columbia to Tla'amin (the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:


1. Tla'amin, as owner of the Upland, on the terms set forth herein, hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the Licence, with Tla'amin's right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and repass over the Float Home Area to gain access to and from the Upland.


2. Tla'amin acknowledges and agrees that the Consent hereby given entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming through them, in accordance with the Licence (collectively, the "Float Home Area Users") to:


a) construct, erect, place, install, moor, maintain, replace, renovate and repair buildings, structures, works, improvements and chattels (collectively, the "Improvements") on all or any part of the Float Home Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes authorized and approved in the Licence, provided however that this Consent does not extend so far as to permit British Columbia to authorize the Float Home Area Users to alter or enlarge any Improvements existing on the Float Home Area on •, or to construct, erect, place, install or moor new Improvements on the Float Home Area after •, if such alteration, enlargement, construction, erection, placement, installation or mooring would materially interfere with reasonable access to the Upland; and


b) do all other acts within the Float Home Area, reasonably necessary or incidental to the purposes authorized and approved in connection with the Licence.


3.

WHEREAS:


Tla'amin is the [registered] owner in fee simple of the land located ..................................., legally described as [INSERT LEGAL DESCRIPTION] (the "Upland"); [Note: Insert Legal Description for area immediately adjacent to foreshore.

D. Tla'amin is prepared to consent to such interference pursuant to the provisions set out below.


NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of ONE ($1.00) dollar and other good and valuable consideration, now paid by British Columbia to Tla'amin (the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:


1. Tla'amin, as owner of the Upland, on the terms set forth herein, hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the Licence, with Tla'amin's right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and repass over the Aquaculture Area to gain access to and from the Upland.


2. Tla'amin acknowledges and agrees that the Consent hereby given entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming through them, in accordance with the Licence (collectively, the "Aquaculture Area Users") to:

3. Tla'amin or any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be, will give written notice of this Consent to any person to whom it proposes to dispose of any portion of the Upland which borders on the Foreshore, which notice will be received by that person prior to such disposition. Prior to or concurrently with such disposition, Tla'amin or any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be, will obtain a written ratification of this Consent by the transferee of such portion of the Upland in the same form as this Consent and will deliver an originally executed copy thereof to British Columbia. For the purposes of this paragraph, the word "dispose" means any transfer by any method to any person entitled to exercise a riparian right of access to the Upland.


4. British Columbia covenants and agrees with Tla'amin that nothing in this Consent will be deemed or otherwise construed so as to permit British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, to enter onto the Upland or to construct, place, erect or install any buildings, structures, improvements or works thereon.


5. This Consent is effective from and after •, 201• ("Effective Date") until •, the end of any renewal term, or the earlier termination of Licence No. • in respect of the interference over the Aquaculture Area.

The parties agree that the amount of the Security does not constitute a liquidated damages estimate of the Owner's damages if the Grantee breaches its obligations hereunder and the Owner reserves its right to claim for further damages.


15.

Disputes



Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement will be resolved as follows:


(a) the parties will attempt to resolve disputes by negotiations, including timely disclosure of all relevant facts, information and documents;


(b) either party may, at any time, by written notice request that the dispute be referred to mediation, conducted by a mediator, knowledgeable about the matters in dispute;


(c) if the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of the notice to mediate under subparagraph (b) then, on the agreement of both parties, the dispute may be referred to a single arbitrator for final resolution. If the parties do not agree to arbitration then either party may refer the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction;


except that it is not incompatible with this paragraph for a party to apply to a court at any time for interim or conservatory relief, and for the court to grant that relief.


16.

If notice is required or permitted under this Agreement, the notice:


(a) must be in writing;


(b) must be delivered to the address set out above, or other address as specified in writing by a party; and

A breach of any term, condition, covenant or other provision of this Agreement may only be waived in writing, and any waiver will not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. Consent to or approval of any act, where consent or approval is required under this Agreement, will not be construed as consent to or approval of any subsequent act.


18.

19.

20.

Entire Agreement

21.

Interpretation



In this Agreement:


(a) all attached schedules form an integral part of this Agreement;


(b) unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural and the masculine includes the feminine gender, body politic and a corporation;


(c) the headings are for convenience only and are not to be construed as defining or in any way limiting the scope or intent of the Agreement;


(d) a reference to an enactment of British Columbia or of Canada will be deemed to include a reference to any subsequent amendments or replacements; and


(e) if any provision is determined by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be considered separate and severable, and the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected by that determination.


22. Each party will, upon the request of the other, do or cause to be done all lawful acts necessary for the performance of the provisions of this Agreement.


23. Wherever this Agreement provides that an action may be taken, a consent or approval must be obtained or a determination must be made, then the Owner or the Grantee, as the case may be, will act reasonably in taking such action, deciding whether to provide such consent or approval or making such determination; but where this Agreement states that the Owner or the Grantee have sole discretion to take an action, provide a consent or approval or make a determination, there will be no requirement to show reasonableness or to act reasonably in taking that action, providing that consent or approval or making that determination.


24. If, due to a strike, lockout, labour dispute, act of God, inability to obtain labour or materials, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of a competent governmental authority, enemy or hostile action, civil commotion, fire or other casualty or any condition or case beyond the Grantee's reasonable control, other than normal weather conditions, the Grantee is delayed in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, the time for the performance of that obligation will be extended by a period of time equal to the period of time of the delay so long as:


(a) the Grantee gives notice to the Owner within 30 days of the commencement of the delay setting forth the nature of the delay and an estimated time frame for the performance of its obligation; and


(b) the Grantee diligently attempts to remove the delay.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have duly executed this Agreement, as of the date first referred to above.

5.3 No assignment or sublicensing pursuant to sections 5.1 or 5.2, nor the Owner's consent thereto, will relieve the Licensee from the observance and performance of the Licensee's obligations contained in this licence.



ARTICLE 6 — CANCELLATION



6.1 If the Licensee fails to observe or perform any term contained herein, and such failure continues after the giving of the written notice by the Owner to the Licensee of the nature of the failure for a period of:


(a) 30 days; or


(b) 150 days, if the failure because of its nature would reasonably require more than 30 days to cure, and provided that the Licensee is proceeding diligently and continuously to cure the failure throughout;


then the Owner may cancel this licence and, notwithstanding subsection (i) of section 4.1, any fixtures to the Land shall become, at the discretion of the Owner, the property of the Owner.


6.2 If this licence is taken in execution or attachment by any person, or the Licensee commits an act of bankruptcy, becomes insolvent, is petitioned into bankruptcy or voluntarily enters into an arrangement with his creditors, the Owner may, on 90 days written notice to the Licensee, cancel this licence and the rights herein granted.


6.3 If the Licensee ceases to use the Land for the purposes permitted herein and the Licensee does not recommence its use of the Land within 180 days of receipt of written notice from the Owner, the Owner may immediately cancel this licence and the rights herein granted.


6.4 The Licensee may deliver a written notice to the Owner cancelling this licence and thereafter the licence and the rights herein granted will terminate 180 days after the date of receipt by the Owner of such written notice.


6.5 Notwithstanding subsection 4.1 (i), any building, machinery, plant, equipment and apparatus, or other improvements to the Land (collectively, the "Improvements") that remain unremoved from the Land:


(a) upon the cancellation of this licence pursuant to section 6.1, or section 6.4; or


(b) thirty days after the expiration or cancellation of this licence pursuant to section 6.2 or section 6.3 (provided that if further time is reasonably required because of the nature of the Improvements or because of other constraints beyond the control of the Licensee, including weather, and provided that the Licensee is proceeding diligently and continuously to remove such Improvements, the 30 day time for removal will be extended to 150 days after the expiration or cancellation of this licence)


shall, at the discretion of the Owner, be forfeited to and become the property of the Owner.


6.6 If the Owner elects to assume ownership of any above-ground Improvements pursuant to section 6.5, the Owner may remove them from the Land and the Licensee shall, on demand, compensate the Owner for all costs incurred by the Owner respecting their removal.


6.7 The rights of the Owner under section 6.5 and section 6.6 shall be deemed to survive the expiration or earlier cancellation of this licence.



ARTICLE 7 — SECURITY



7.1 The security in the sum of $1.00 and all rights, privileges, benefits and interests accruing thereto delivered by the Licensee to the Owner (herein called the "Security") to guarantee the performance of the Licensee's obligations under this licence shall be maintained in effect until such time as the Owner certifies in writing that such obligations have been fully performed. So long as the Licensee is Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia or a British Columbia crown corporation, the Owner will waive the requirements of this section.


7.2 If the Licensee defaults in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, the Owner may, in its sole discretion, sell, call in and convert the Security, or any part of it, and such Security shall be deemed to have been absolutely forfeited to the Owner.


7.3 The rights of the Owner under this Article shall be deemed to continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the expiration or earlier cancellation of this licence.


7.4 Notwithstanding any amount of Security stated to be required under section 7.1 the Owner may, acting reasonably, from time to time by notice to the Licensee, demand the amount to be changed to that specified in a notice and the Licensee shall, within 60 days of such notice, change the Security to that specified and provide the Owner with evidence of the change, except that while Security is waived under section 7.1, this section shall not apply.



ARTICLE 8 — NOTICE



8.1 Whenever service of a notice or a document is required under this licence, the notice or documents shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been served if delivered to, or if sent by prepaid registered mail addressed to, the Owner or the Licensee, as the case may be, at the addresses specified for each on the first page of this licence, and where service is by registered mail the notice or document shall be conclusively deemed to have been served on the eighth day after its deposit in a Canada Post office at any place in Canada. If there is a disruption in mail service caused by labour dispute, civil unrest or other events beyond the control of the parties, between mailing and actual receipt of such notice, the party sending such notice will re-send by courier, fax or other electronic means and such notice will only be effective if actually received.


8.2 Either party may, by notice in writing to the other, specify another address for service of notices under this licence and after another address has been specified under this section, notices shall be mailed to that address in accordance with this Article.



ARTICLE 9 — MISCELLANEOUS



9.1 No term, condition, covenant or other provision herein shall be considered to have been waived by the Owner unless such waiver is expressed in writing by the Owner. Any such waiver of any term, condition, covenant or other provision herein shall not be construed as or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach of the same or any other term, condition, covenant, or other provision and the consent or approval of the Owner to any act by the Licensee requiring the consent or approval of the Owner shall not be considered to waive or render unnecessary such consents or approvals to any subsequent similar act by the Licensee.


9.2 No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Owner is exclusive of any other remedy herein or provided by law, but such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy herein or hereafter existing at law, in equity, or by statute.


9.3 This licence shall not entitle the Licensee to exclusive possession of the Land and the Owner may, for any purpose, grant to others interests in the Land or rights to enter on or use or occupy the Land, or may otherwise authorize other persons to enter on or use or occupy the Land, so long as the grant or authorization does not materially affect the exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder. The question of whether a grant materially affects the exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder shall be determined by the Owner acting reasonably. If the Owner, by written instrument, grants a licence, right or interest to others to use or occupy the Land, such grant will contain a provision identical to subsection 4.1 (f) of this licence obligating the new grantee to keep the Land in a safe, clean and sanitary condition satisfactory to the Owner.


9.4 The terms and provisions of this licence shall extend to, be binding upon and enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns.


9.5 Time is of the essence in this agreement.



ARTICLE 10 — DISPUTE RESOLUTION



10.1 In this Article, "dispute" means any dispute arising out of or in connection with this licence or in respect of any defined legal relationship associated with it or derived from it.


10.2 The parties agree to attempt to resolve all disputes by negotiations conducted in good faith and to provide timely disclosure of all relevant facts, information and documents to further those negotiations.


10.3 If a dispute is not settled through direct negotiations either party may request the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (BCICAC) to appoint a mediator to conduct a mediation under its mediation rules of procedure.


10.4 If a dispute is not settled within 15 days of the appointment of the mediator or any further period of time agreed to by the parties, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator under the arbitration rules of procedure of the BCICAC.


10.5 If the BCICAC is unavailable or unable to administer the mediation or arbitration of a dispute under its rules of procedure, the parties will select the rules of another institution.



ARTICLE 11 — INTERPRETATION



11.1 In this licence, unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural and the masculine includes the feminine gender and a corporation.


11.2 The captions and headings contained in this licence are for convenience only and are not to be construed as defining or in any way limiting the scope or intent of the provisions herein.


11.3 If any section of this licence or any part of a section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that part or section, as the case may be, shall be considered separate and severable and the remaining parts and sections of this licence shall not be affected thereby and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this licence as of the day and year first above written.
