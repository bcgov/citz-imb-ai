General principles of liability for remediation





47



(1)


A person who is responsible for remediation of a contaminated site is absolutely, retroactively and jointly and separately liable to any person or government body for reasonably incurred costs of remediation of the contaminated site, whether incurred on or off the contaminated site.






(2)


Subsection (1) must not be construed as prohibiting the apportionment of a share of liability to one or more responsible persons by the court in an action or proceeding under subsection (5) or by a director in an order under section 48

[remediation orders]

.






(3)


For the purpose of this section,

"costs of remediation"

means all costs of remediation and includes, without limitation,






(a)


costs of preparing a site disclosure statement,






(b)


costs of carrying out a site investigation and preparing a report, whether or not there has been a determination under section 44

[determination of contaminated sites]

as to whether or not the site is a contaminated site,






(c)


legal and consultant costs associated with seeking contributions from other responsible persons, and






(d)


fees imposed by a director, a municipality, an approving officer or the regulator under this Part.






(4)


Liability under this Part applies






(a)


even though the introduction of a substance into the environment is or was not prohibited by any legislation if the introduction contributed in whole or in part to the site becoming a contaminated site, and






(b)


despite the terms of any cancelled, expired, abandoned or current permit or approval or waste management plan and its associated operational certificate that authorizes the discharge of waste into the environment.






(5)


Subject to section 50 (3)

[minor contributors]

, any person, including, but not limited to, a responsible person and a director, who incurs costs in carrying out remediation of a contaminated site may commence an action or a proceeding to recover the reasonably incurred costs of remediation from one or more responsible persons in accordance with the principles of liability set out in this Part.






(6)


Subject to subsections (7) and (8), a person is not required to obtain, as a condition of an action or proceeding under subsection (5) being heard by a court,






(a)


a decision, determination, opinion or apportionment of liability for remediation from a director, or






(b)


an opinion respecting liability from an allocation panel.






(7)


In all cases, the site that is the subject of an action or proceeding must be determined or considered under section 44

[determination of contaminated sites]

to be or to have been a contaminated site before the court can hear the matter.






(8)


Despite subsection (7), if independent remediation has been carried out at a site and the site has not been determined or considered under section 44

[determination of contaminated sites]

to be or to have been a contaminated site, the court must determine whether the site is or was a contaminated site.






(9)


The court may determine in accordance with the regulations, unless otherwise determined or established under this Part, any of the following:






(a)


whether a person is responsible for remediation of a contaminated site;






(b)


whether the costs of remediation of a contaminated site have been reasonably incurred and the amount of the reasonably incurred costs of remediation;






(c)


the apportionment of the reasonably incurred costs of remediation of a contaminated site among one or more responsible persons in accordance with the principles of liability set out in this Part;






(d)


such other determinations as are necessary to a fair and just disposition of these matters.

(b)


contribute, in cash or in kind, towards the costs of another person who has reasonably incurred costs of remediation;






(c)


give security, which may include real and personal property, in the amount and form the director specifies.






(3)


For the purpose of deciding whether to require a person to undertake remediation under subsection (2), a director may consider whether remediation should begin promptly, and must consider each of the following:






(a)


adverse effects on human health or pollution of the environment caused by contamination at the site;






(b)


the potential for adverse effects on human health or pollution of the environment arising from contamination at the site;






(c)


the likelihood of the responsible persons or other persons not acting expeditiously or satisfactorily in implementing remediation;






(d)


in consultation with the chief permitting officer designated under the

A remediation order does not affect or modify a right of a person affected by the order to seek or obtain relief under an agreement, other legislation or common law, including, but not limited to, damages for injury or loss resulting from a release or threatened release of a contaminating substance.






(6)


If a remediation order, or a pollution abatement order under section 83

[pollution abatement orders]

that imposes a requirement for remediation, is issued in respect of a site, and the director has not yet determined under section 44

[determination of contaminated sites]

whether the site is a contaminated site, as soon as reasonably possible after the issuance of the order, the director must determine






(a)


whether the site is a contaminated site, in accordance with section 44

[determination of contaminated sites]

, and






(b)


whether the person named in the order is a responsible person under section 45

[persons responsible for remediation of contaminated sites]

.






(7)


If a person named in an order referred to in subsection (6) is determined not to be a responsible person, the government must compensate the person, in accordance with the regulations, for any costs directly incurred by the person in complying with the order.






(8)


A person who receives a remediation order under subsection (1) or notice of a remediation order under subsection (13) must not, without the consent of the director, knowingly do anything that diminishes or reduces assets that could be used to satisfy the terms and conditions of the remediation order, and if the person does so, the director despite any other remedy sought, may commence an action against the person to recover the amount of the diminishment or reduction.






(9)


The director may provide in a remediation order that a responsible person is not required to begin remediation of a contaminated site for a specified period of time if the contaminated site does not present an imminent and significant threat or risk to






(a)


human health, given current and anticipated human exposure, or






(b)


the environment.






(10)


A person who has submitted a site disclosure statement under section 40 (7)

[site disclosure statements of trustee, receiver, etc.]

must not directly or indirectly diminish or reduce assets at a site designated in the site registry as a contaminated site, including, without limitation, by






(a)


disposing of real or personal assets, or






(b)


subdividing land


unless the person first requests and obtains written notice from a director that the director does not intend to issue a remediation order.






(11)


If a director issues or gives notice of the intention to issue a remediation order to a person referred to in subsection (10), subsection (8) applies.






(12)


A director may amend or cancel a remediation order.






(13)


A director, on making a remediation order must, within a reasonable time, provide notice of the order in writing to every person holding an interest in the contaminated site if the interest is registered in the land title office or a land registry office of a treaty first nation at the time of issuing the order.






(14)


A remediation order may authorize, subject to the terms and conditions a director considers necessary and reasonable, any person designated by the director to enter specified land for the purpose of ensuring that the remediation order is carried out according to its terms.






(15)


If a remediation order authorizes a person to enter specified land, the person who owns or occupies the land must allow the authorized person to enter in accordance with the authorization.






(16)


Subsections (14) and (15) do not authorize any person to enter any structure or part of a structure that is used solely as a private residence.

(a)


whether the person is a responsible person;






(b)


whether a responsible person is a minor contributor;






(c)


the responsible person's contribution to the contamination and, if the costs of remediation are known or reasonably ascertainable, the share of those costs attributable to that contamination.

A director may determine that a responsible person is a minor contributor if the person demonstrates that






(a)


only a minor portion of the contamination present at the site can be attributed to the person,






(b)


either






(i)


no remediation would be required solely as a result of the contribution of the person to the contamination at the site, or






(ii)


the cost of remediation attributable to the person would be only a minor portion of the total cost of the remediation required at the site, and






(c)


in all circumstances the application of joint and separate liability to the person would be unduly harsh.






(2)


If a director makes a determination under subsection (1) that a responsible person is a minor contributor, the director must determine the amount or portion of remediation costs attributable to the responsible person.






(3)


A responsible person determined to be a minor contributor under subsection (1) is liable for remediation costs in an action or proceeding brought by another person or the government under section 47

[general principles of liability for remediation]

only up to the amount or portion specified by the director in the determination under subsection (2).






(4)


If a director has determined that a responsible person is a minor contributor for a site, the site is considered to be a contaminated site at the time of that determination, despite the absence of a determination under section 44 (1)
