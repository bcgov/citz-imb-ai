"debenture"

means a debenture issued by the deposit insurance corporation under this Part;



"deposits"

, used as a noun in relation to a credit union, means the total of

(c)


declared but unpaid dividends on the non-equity shares referred to in paragraph (b);



"money on deposit"

means the unpaid balance of the aggregate of money received by a credit union from or on behalf of a depositor in the course of carrying on deposit business for which the credit union
