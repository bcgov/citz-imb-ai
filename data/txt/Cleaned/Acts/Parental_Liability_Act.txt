the age and maturity of the child;

Part 4 — Evidentiary Matters related to Young Offenders







Proof





11



(1)


In this section,

"offence"

has the same meaning as in the federal youth legislation.






(2)


In an action under this Act, proof that a child has been found guilty of an offence under the federal youth legislation is proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the offence was committed by the child if






(a)


no appeal of the finding of guilt was taken and the time for an appeal has expired, or






(b)


an appeal of the finding of guilt was taken but was dismissed or abandoned and no further appeal is available.






(3)


For the purposes of subsection (2), a copy of an order of disposition or sentence under the federal youth legislation purporting to be signed by the officer having custody of the records of the court that made the order is, on proof of the identity of the child named in the order as guilty of the offence, sufficient evidence that the child was found guilty of the offence, without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed the order.








Disclosure of evidence obtained under federal youth legislation





12



If evidence obtained under the federal youth legislation is presented in an action under this Act, the court file must not be disclosed to any person except to the following:
