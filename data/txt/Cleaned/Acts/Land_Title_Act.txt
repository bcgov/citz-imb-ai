(a)


the registered owner, purporting to include in the plan the accreted land, has established to it a good safe holding and marketable title in fee simple, and






(b)


the subdivider's indefeasible title to the land included in the boundaries of the plan and affected by the accretion is the registered title to the accreted land.

(a)


the registered owner, purporting to include in the plan tendered for deposit the area comprising the subject matter of the discrepancy, has established to the area a good safe holding and marketable title in fee simple, and

(a)


signed by the Surveyor General, and

(b)


the boundary lines of each section, district lot or parcel affected by the plan must be shown according to the original survey, and there must also be shown a sufficient number of angular and linear measurements to define the limits of the statutory right of way and to show their connection with each section, district lot or parcel through which the statutory right of way passes;






(c)


if the statutory right of way is through land that has been subdivided and shown on any deposited plan, the plan must show distinctly, as to all registered parcels affected by the statutory right of way, the boundaries and designation of each parcel according to the deposited plan, and a sufficient number of angular and linear measurements to show the location and connection of the statutory right of way with each registered parcel and subdivision affected;






(d)


except as provided in section 117, the centre line from which measurements to the limits of the statutory right of way are shown must be referenced on the ground by iron posts or equally permanent monuments, so placed as to identify the points of deflection from all tangents, and the plan must show, by angular and linear measurements, the relation of all corners of the land within the statutory right of way plan to those iron posts or monuments;






(e)


if transition curves are used on the located centre line of the statutory right of way, they must be replaced in each case on the plan tendered for deposit by a simple curve tangential to the main tangent and compounded with the main curve at its junction with the transition curve, and the simple curve must then be called a terminal curve;

(2)


Unless expressly excepted or qualified, and except as provided in subsection (3), a transfer of a freehold estate for valuable consideration in the approved form or in a form permitted by the registrar under section 185 (2) (b) is deemed






(a)


to be made under Part 1 of the


Land Transfer Form Act


,






(b)


to contain the forms of words contained in column 1 of Schedule 2 to that Act, and






(c)


to be made by the transferor as covenantor with the transferee as covenantee,


and to have the same effect and be construed as if it contained the forms of words contained in column 2 of Schedule 2 to that Act.






(3)


Despite subsection (2), unless expressly excepted or qualified, a transfer of an estate in fee simple in the approved form made by a personal representative or trustee is deemed to contain only the form of words in section 7 of column 1 of Schedule 2 to the


Land Transfer Form Act


, Part 1, and to have the same effect and be construed as if it contained only the form of words in section 7 of column 2 of Schedule 2 to that Act.






(4)

189



(1)


The holder of a duplicate indefeasible title to land for which the holder has given a transfer must deliver up the holder's duplicate indefeasible title to the registrar for cancellation.

(b)


an undivided interest in the land less than the whole interest shown on the duplicate indefeasible title,


the registrar may,






(c)


in the manner provided in this section, cancel the duplicate indefeasible title and the existing indefeasible title and, subject to production of a reference or explanatory plan that the registrar may require, register a new indefeasible title covering the remainder, or






(d)

(2)


The registrar may, instead of the procedure set out in subsection (1), endorse the change of name on the register.






(3)


On application by a person who is the registered owner of a charge, and on production of proof satisfactory to the registrar that the name of that person has been lawfully changed, and of the person's identity, the registrar must endorse the change of name on the register.

Registration of several indefeasible titles instead of original





192



(1)


On application by a registered owner of the fee simple and on the surrender and cancellation of one or more duplicate indefeasible titles, the registrar may cancel the title in the register, and register in the name of the owner, subject to the restrictions of sections 158 and 178, one or more indefeasible titles collectively covering the land included in the surrendered titles and, respectively, covering that part of the land that the owner may direct.






(2)


On application by a registered owner whose title is subject to one or more cancelled charges, and on the surrender and cancellation of the registered owner's duplicate indefeasible title, the registrar may cancel the subsisting title and register a new indefeasible title.






(3)


On application by tenants in common, the registrar may, in the same manner as provided in subsection (1),






(a)


consolidate in one indefeasible title the undivided interests to which the applicants are entitled, or






(b)


unless the separation would result in the same person being the registered owner under separate indefeasible titles of all that person's undivided interests, separate into several indefeasible titles the undivided interests to which the applicants are entitled.






(4)


The holder of a duplicate indefeasible title on which the registrar has endorsed a transfer of part of the land included in the indefeasible title, may surrender it for cancellation under this section and receive a new duplicate indefeasible title for the land or interest remaining in the surrendered certificate.

The registrar may act under subsection (2) or (4) without an application being made.






(6)


The registrar must note in the register all conditions, charges, liens, interests and endorsements to which the respective land is subject at the time of the application or of the registrar proceeding under subsection (5).

(1)


On the registrar being satisfied by affidavit that a duplicate indefeasible title has been lost or destroyed, and on advertisement of the registrar's intention published for such time in one or more newspapers, or in the Gazette, or in both, as the registrar considers necessary and proper, the registrar may issue a provisional indefeasible title instead of the duplicate indefeasible title lost or destroyed.






(2)


The provisional indefeasible title must contain an exact copy of the corresponding indefeasible title kept in the register, and of every endorsement on it, and must state the reason why it is issued and refer to the document filed as evidence of loss or destruction by its filing number.






(3)


The registrar must note on the register the issue of the provisional indefeasible title and the date of issue and refer to the document filed as evidence of loss or destruction by its filing number.






(4)


The registrar may dispense with the advertisement of intention or may substitute the posting of a notice in the land title office if the registrar is satisfied of the destruction of the duplicate indefeasible title or of its loss under such circumstances that it could not fall into other hands and that advertisement may safely be dispensed with.






(5)


The registrar may, on the surrender of a defaced or mutilated duplicate indefeasible title, issue a provisional indefeasible title in place of it.

Floating charges on land





203



(1)


In this section:



"circular priority"

means the situation where 3 or more competing charges have been registered against the same parcel of land and the application of subsections (9) and (10) leads to a priority relationship among them in which each charge is subordinate in priority to at least one of the other charges;



"crystallized"

, with reference to a floating charge, means a charge that has fixed on specific land in accordance with the applicable law and the terms of the instrument in which the charge is created;



"financing statement"

has the same meaning as in the


Personal Property Security Act


;



"floating charge"

means a charge that secures the payment or performance of an obligation and that does not become a fixed charge on specific land until the occurrence of an event, stipulated in the instrument that created the floating charge.






(2)


The personal property registry established under the


Personal Property Security Act


is the proper office for registration of an uncrystallized floating charge.






(3)


An uncrystallized floating charge may be registered in the personal property registry by registering a financing statement in the form and manner prescribed under the


Personal Property Security Act


.






(4)


If a floating charge and a security interest in personal property are created by the same instrument, registration with respect to that security interest under the


Personal Property Security Act


also constitutes registration of the floating charge under subsection (3).

Sections 18, 43 (1) to (9), (12) to (15), 44 to 48 and 51 to 54 of the


Personal Property Security Act

the circumstances under which the crystallization occurred.






(7)


Registration of a crystallized floating charge does not constitute a determination by the registrar that crystallization has occurred.






(8)


Except as provided in subsection (6), the registrar must not register a floating charge.






(9)


The priority of a crystallized floating charge registered under section 197 must be determined under sections 27 and 28.






(10)


Despite subsection (9), priority between crystallized floating charges that charge the same parcel of land must be determined by the date of registration under subsection (3) or section 197, whichever is the earlier.






(11)


If a circular priority exists, the rights of the parties must be resolved by allowing the person having priority under subsection (10) to pursue the person's claim as if the person were subrogated to the claim of the person otherwise having priority under subsection (9).






(12)


The priority of a floating charge registered against a specific parcel of land before October 1, 1990 must be determined without regard to this section.

An uncrystallized floating charge that, immediately before October 1, 1990, was covered by an unexpired registration under section 75 of the

(2)


Unless the holder is a party to it, a modification of a charge does not affect the holder of a charge registered before the registration of the modification.








Form of postponement





207

Subject to subsection (3), a positive covenant in a party wall agreement registered on or after the date this section comes into force runs with and binds, without further registration, the adjoining parcels against which the party wall agreement is registered and renders each successor in title to the adjoining parcels subject to the obligations of the positive covenant.






(3)


Despite any term to the contrary in a registered party wall agreement, a person who was an owner of an adjoining parcel against which the party wall agreement is registered is not liable for any breach of a positive covenant in the party wall agreement if the breach occurs after the person ceased to be an owner of the adjoining parcel.






(4)


A positive covenant in a party wall agreement is an interest in land and registerable under this Act.

(4)


Section 157 applies to this section.








Application to cancel mortgage created by vendor





242



(1)


If application has been made to the registrar to register a transfer of land






(a)


from a registered owner in fee simple, in this section called a "transferor", to the holder of a registered charge by way of an agreement for sale, in this section called the "purchaser",






(b)


from a registered owner in fee simple, in this section called a "transferor", to the holder of a registered charge by way of an option to purchase, in this section called the "optionee", or






(c)


from a registered owner of a charge by way of agreement for sale, in this section called a "transferor", to the holder of a registered charge by way of a subagreement for sale, in this section called the "subpurchaser",


and there is registered against the title to the land a mortgage created by a transferor referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) and registered after the registration of the agreement for sale, option or subagreement for sale, as the case may be, the registrar may give notice to the mortgagee of the registrar's intention, on the expiration of the time set by the notice, being not less than 14 days from the service of the notice on the mortgagee, to register the transfer free from the mortgage.






(2)


If the mortgagee disputes the right of the purchaser, optionee or subpurchaser, as the case may be, to registration free of the mortgage, the mortgagee must file with the registrar a notice of objection in the form approved by the director within the time set by the registrar's notice.






(3)


If no notice of objection is filed by the mortgagee, the registrar may effect registration pursuant to the application free from the mortgage and the mortgage no longer forms a charge on the land.

Redemption of mortgage if mortgagee absent





243

If a mortgagor or owner of the equity of redemption becomes entitled to pay off or has paid off a mortgage in accordance with its terms, and

the registered mortgagee is absent from British Columbia or cannot be found, and






(b)


there is no person in British Columbia authorized, by power of attorney filed in the land title office where the mortgage is registered, to receive payment of the mortgage money and execute a discharge of the mortgage,


the Supreme Court may,






(c)


on application made without notice to any person, and






(d)


on proof of the facts and of the amount, if any, due for principal, interest and all other sums rightly payable to the mortgagee under the mortgage,


order






(e)


within a time limited in the order, the payment of that amount, less the taxed costs of the application, into court to the credit of the mortgagee or other person entitled to it, or






(f)


that, if the mortgage has been paid off in accordance with its terms, the mortgage be discharged.






(2)


On payment into court of the amount so ordered within the time limited, all interest accruing under the mortgage ceases.






(3)


On application to the registrar for cancellation, and on deposit of a certified copy of the order with proof of






(a)


payment, if any, into court in compliance with the order, and






(b)


mailing a copy of the order to the mortgagee at the mortgagee's last known address,


the registrar must make an entry in the register cancelling the registration of the mortgage, and the entry is deemed to be a valid discharge of the mortgage and has the same effect as a similar entry made on an application for cancellation accompanied by the production of a discharge of mortgage executed by the mortgagee.






(4)


Money paid into court under this section must, with the accrued interest, be paid out to the person entitled to it on application accompanied by proof of the surrender to the registrar of the certificate of charge or duplicate indefeasible title, if any, held by that person relating to the land covered by the mortgage.








Mortgagee's refusal or neglect to give discharge





244



(1)


If a mortgagee, without just cause, refuses or neglects to give the mortgagor or owner of the equity of redemption, herein referred to as the "owner", a discharge of the mortgage, despite the tender or attempted tender of all money due and owing by the owner to the mortgagee, the owner may make an application to the Supreme Court in the same manner as provided in section 243, and the court has all the power conferred on that court by section 243.






(2)


Section 243 (1) (a) and (b) does not apply to this section.








Vesting order in favour of purchaser





245



(1)


If it is proved to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court that






(a)


land has been sold by a registered owner and the whole of the purchase money has been paid,






(b)


the purchaser, being the registered holder of an agreement for sale of land or subagreement for sale of land, or a person claiming under the purchaser, has entered and taken possession under the purchase, and






(c)


entry and possession have been acquiesced in by the vendor or the vendor's representatives, but






(d)


a transfer cannot be obtained because the registered owner is dead, or out of British Columbia, or cannot be found, or, for any reason, it is impracticable to obtain the registered owner's signature within a reasonable time,


the court may make a vesting order to give effect to the sale and vest title to the land in the purchaser.






(2)


The registrar, on






(a)


application,






(b)


the deposit of a certified copy of the court order, and






(c)


being satisfied that the purchaser has established a good safe holding and marketable title to the land,


must register an indefeasible title to the land in the name of the purchaser, or, if the purchaser is the registered owner of a subright to purchase, must give effect to the order by making an appropriate endorsement on the register.








Cancellation if charge determined by effluxion of time





246



(1)


If a registered charge that, by the terms of the instrument creating or evidencing it, is determined by the effluxion of time or the happening of an event, the registrar, on application and after giving such notice as the registrar considers necessary or advisable, may cancel the registration of the charge on the effluxion of the time or the happening of the event.






(2)


Nothing in this section authorizes the registrar, without an order of the Supreme Court, to cancel, because of the purchaser's default, the registration of an agreement for sale or a subagreement for sale of land, whether made before or after this section comes into force.








Cancellation of lease on breach of covenant





247



(1)


In this section,

"derivative charge"

means a sublease or other charge derived through a lease and includes a mortgage or judgment registered against the lessee or sublessee.






(2)


If a lease is registered, the registrar may,






(a)


on application,






(b)


on proof to the registrar's satisfaction of a breach of a covenant and re-entry and recovery of possession by the lessor or owner of the reversion,






(c)


after 30 days' notice of the application to the lessee, and






(d)


on hearing all parties attending on the hearing of the application,


cancel the registration of the lease on the register, and the estate of the lessee in the land described in the lease, and the lease, so far as it affects the land, ceases.






(3)


Cancellation of the lease does not release the lessee from liability in respect of an express or implied covenant in the lease.






(4)


If a person appears on the register as holder of a derivative charge, the registrar may require the applicant for cancellation to give 30 days' notice to that person.






(5)


If the registrar cancels the registration of the lease the registrar may cancel the derivative charge, and the estate of the holder of the derivative charge in the land described in the instrument under which the derivative charge is registered, and the instrument, so far as it affects the land, ceases, but the cancellation does not release a party to the instrument from liability in respect of an express or implied covenant in it.








Effect of cancellation





248



If a reconveyance, surrender or transfer would otherwise have been necessary, the cancellation of the registration of a charge operates as and must for all purposes be deemed to be a reconveyance, surrender or transfer in favour of the person entitled in equity to the land in question, and the charge no longer affects the land in respect of which it was registered.








Power of court to order cancellation of charge





249



(1)


If, in a proceeding pending in the Supreme Court,






(a)


a question is raised






(i)


as to the validity of a registered charge, or






(ii)


as to money owing on or rights respecting a registered charge, and






(b)


in the opinion of the court, the question raised is sufficiently material for the application of this section,


on affidavit or other proof of the good faith of the question raised, the court may, on terms as to security and otherwise it considers proper, order that the registration of the charge be cancelled on payment into court of a specified amount of money by the person claiming relief.






(2)


Except under special circumstances to be established to the satisfaction of the court, an order must not be made under this section for the cancellation of the registration of a mortgage, except on payment into court of the full amount which the mortgagee, or the mortgagee's successor in title, has stated on affidavit to be due.








Cancellation of charge on payment into court





250



(1)


If land that is subject to a charge, whether immediately payable or not, is sold under an order of a court directing the land to be sold, the court may, if it considers proper, on the application of a party to the sale, direct or allow payment into court,






(a)


if an annual sum is charged on the land or a capital sum is charged on a determinable interest in the land, of such amount as, when invested in securities approved by the court, the court considers will be sufficient to yield an income adequate to pay or otherwise provide for that charge, and






(b)


if capital money is charged on the land, of such amount as is sufficient to meet the charge and any interest due on it.






(2)


In either of the cases referred to in subsection (1) there must be paid into court such additional amount, not exceeding 10% of the original amount to be paid in, as the court considers will be sufficient to meet further costs, expenses and interest, excepting the depreciation of investments.






(3)


On compliance with subsections (1) and (2) the court must, if it considers proper, without notice to the owner of the charge or with such notice as the court considers proper,






(a)

The surveyor in charge of the special survey must make the survey and plan under the guidance and instruction of the minister and within whatever period of time may be prescribed by the minister.








Preliminary procedure





331



The surveyor must proceed to retrace the existing outside boundaries of the land described in the order for the special survey, and must report on that to the minister either






(a)


that the boundaries are well defined and there is no danger of contest arising with owners outside and adjacent to the special survey area, in which event the surveyor must proceed with the survey without further directions, or






(b)


that the boundaries are uncertain and there is danger of a conflict, and, if the circumstances warrant, that a conflict may be avoided or minimized by including in the survey further adjacent land.








Supplemental order or direction of minister

On receipt of a report in the terms of section 331 (b) the minister may either






(a)


make a supplemental order extending the boundaries of the special survey area to include the land, if any, recommended by the surveyor, and then the order must apply to that land as fully and effectually as if it had been included in the original limits of the special survey, or






(b)


direct the surveyor to provide a plan of the external boundaries of the special survey area either as originally defined or as including the adjacent land recommended by the surveyor, or of that portion of the external boundaries as is in doubt, in which case the surveyor must provide a plan showing the adjacent parcels of land, the owners of which would be affected by the final adoption of the boundary lines recommended by the surveyor,


and in any event may amend the termination date of the period within which the survey is to be made if a period has been prescribed under section 330.








Procedure for fixing boundary of survey area





333



(1)


On receipt of a plan provided under section 332 (b), the minister must deposit a copy with the proper officer and in the land title office, and the proper officer must give to the registered owner of each parcel adjacent to the boundary line shown on the plan, and to each registered owner of a charge on it, and to another person, as directed by the minister, a notice in writing stating that the plan has been deposited, and that the line as shown on it will be adopted as the boundary line between the special survey area and the adjacent land, and that the interests of the person to whom the notice is directed are affected by the survey, and setting a time and place for the hearing of any complaint that may be made against the adoption of the line as the boundary of the special survey area, and thereafter the procedure under section 344 and following sections, in regard to the filing of objections and hearing, must be followed as far as applicable and with the necessary changes, and the minister must, by supplemental order, fix as the boundary of the special survey area either the line recommended by the surveyor or any other line which on the evidence before the minister appears as the proper boundary.






(2)


The line fixed finally determines the boundary between the land in the special survey area and adjacent land, and if any damages or compensation are awarded to the registered owners of land outside the special survey area they form part of and must be paid out of the same fund as the expenses of the survey.








Transmittal of copy of supplemental order to proper officer and registrar





334



(1)


If a supplemental order is made under either section 332 or 333, a certified copy of it must be transmitted to the proper officer, who must give to registered owners of land in the added area the same notice as is called for by section 329.






(2)


A certified copy of the supplemental order must also be transmitted to the registrar.








Guiding principles for surveyor





335



(1)


In making the survey the surveyor must re-establish as nearly as possible the existing survey, but the surveyor may depart from existing boundaries in order to establish boundaries in agreement with occupation and improvements.

The surveyor must endeavour to make adjustments that will reduce the total amount of compensation to a minimum and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the surveyor may in particular distribute any shortage in area within a block or group of parcels, having regard to occupation and improvements, and may similarly allot a surplus to a registered owner willing to pay compensation, or create a separate parcel to be disposed of for the reduction of the cost and expenses of the survey.








Nature of survey





336



(1)


The surveyor must limit the survey to a block outline survey where the survey would accomplish the object of the special survey, but where a block outline survey would not have that effect the surveyor must make an effective survey which may be in part a complete survey and in part a block outline survey, as the surveyor thinks advisable.






(2)


The surveyor must, on written request of the registered owner of a parcel, preferred while the survey is in progress, make a complete survey of that parcel, and the additional cost occasioned by it must be borne by the registered owner and charged against the land affected on the completion of the survey.








Plans





337



(1)


In preparing a special survey plan the surveyor must show on it the boundaries of all parcels with their dimensions, although the surveyor has not actually run the boundaries on the ground.






(2)


Where lines have been run and monuments established the location of them must be shown on the plan.








Appointment of substituted surveyor





338



(1)


The minister may, after a special survey has been ordered, appoint another surveyor approved by the Surveyor General in the place of the surveyor directed to make the survey, and may, by the order appointing the substituted surveyor, direct that as much of the special survey as had been made by the surveyor first appointed must be adopted and made use of by the substituted surveyor, and may then, or after the completion of the special survey, determine how and by whom the work of the surveyor first appointed is to be certified or otherwise authenticated.






(2)


The special survey, although made by more than one surveyor, is, on its final approval, as valid and binding for all purposes as if made by the surveyor first appointed.








Report of surveyor





339

(2)


The surveyor must include in the report in concise and tabulated form






(a)


a list of all parcels comprised within the limits of the survey, with the names of the respective registered owners,






(b)


a list of all parcels the boundaries of which appear as altered by the plan, with a statement showing how they are altered,






(c)


a statement of the costs and expenses of the survey, showing the respective areas of parcels consisting of highways or Crown land, and of land of private owners, and an apportionment of the costs and expenses in accordance with sections 324, 325 and 326, and






(d)


a statement containing an estimate of the damage or increased value of each parcel occasioned by the alterations affected by the plan, and showing in detail a just and equitable apportionment among the registered owners of the parcels affected, and the method adopted as the basis of the apportionment in each case.

Principles for determining compensation





349



In determining all questions relating to compensation, the minister must be guided by the principle that as the survey was undertaken for the benefit of all registered owners within the special survey area, such registered owners should in proportion to the area of their respective parcels share any loss and any advantage occasioned by and accruing from the special survey, and that if for the general benefit or for the preservation of individual improvements the surveyor has reduced the area of any parcel, the registered owner should receive compensation from the registered owner benefited or from a general fund formed by payments from the registered owners benefited, as the case may be, and that any registered owner who has been benefited should contribute an adequate amount to the general fund or pay it to the registered owner who has suffered loss, as the case may be.

The order in council, unless appealed from, takes effect on being registered at or after the expiration of 20 days from the date of publication of the notice in the Gazette, and if appealed from takes effect in accordance with the final judgment given on appeal on being registered together with a certified copy of the final judgment.






(4)


On the taking effect of the order in council the special survey and plan as finally approved are final and binding on all persons.








Appeal





353



(1)


Any decision, order or direction of the minister given or made under this Part and embodied in the order in council approving the special survey and plan is subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal.






(2)


The Court of Appeal must decide the matter brought before it on appeal as it considers just and equitable, and the decision of the Court of Appeal is subject to appeal in the same manner as decisions of that court on appeal from a final judgment in civil causes.






(3)


On every appeal the court appealed to may award compensation to any party to the appeal as the court thinks proper, and may direct by whom it must be paid, and may vary or amend the decision, order or direction appealed from, and may direct the special survey and plan to be amended by the minister in accordance with the decision on appeal, and may, if it thinks necessary, refer the whole matter back to the minister in order that the judgment of the court may be embodied in a new report and submitted to the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and may award costs and direct that they must be paid by a party to the appeal, or that they must form part of the costs of the survey.






(4)


Evidence must not be given or heard on an appeal under this section other than that given or heard before the minister at the time the decision, order or direction appealed from was given or made.








Entry of appeal





354



(1)


The appeal must be entered for hearing in the court, and notice of the appeal delivered at the office of the minister and to the registrar, and served on all persons whose interests are directly affected, within 20 days from the date of publication in the Gazette of the notice of the order in council as provided in this Part.






(2)


An appeal of which notice has been served on the minister and registrar does not abate because of it not having been served on other persons directly affected, but the court may, on terms it thinks just, allow an adjournment and direct any person affected to be served, and may specify the method of service.








Registration





355



(1)


A certified copy of the order in council, together with the plan of special survey, must be at once transmitted by the clerk of the Executive Council to the registrar, and on the expiration of 20 days from the date of publication in the Gazette of the notice of the order in council as provided in this Part without any appeal being taken, the registrar must register it in the manner provided in this Part.






(2)


If an appeal is taken, the minister must, on the giving of final judgment in the appeal, transmit a certified copy of the judgment to the registrar, and if the judgment refers the matter back to the minister and a further order in council is passed, the clerk of the Executive Council must transmit a certified copy of the order to the registrar.






(3)


The registrar, on receipt of the final judgment or the order in council, as the case may be, must, subject to any further appeal, register it, together with the plan, in the manner provided.








Method of registration





356



(1)


Registration is effected by endorsing on the order in council and on the judgment, if any, the following memorandum signed by the registrar and impressed with the official seal of the land title office, and the memorandum is conclusive evidence of the registration of the instruments and of the time of registration:




The within document, together with the plan of the special survey referred to, was registered ..................

[month, day, year]

. Filed as No. ...................., documents filed, and plan deposited as No. .................... , plans deposited.


..................................................



Registrar







(2)


An endorsement of the registration of the order in council and special survey plan and judgment, if any, must be made against the indefeasible title of every parcel of land affected by the special survey by noting the following information:




Special Survey Plan No. ............................ and order in council approving same (and judgment) filed as No. ......................., and registered .......................

[month, day, year].







(3)


The registrar must, when necessary, correct indefeasible titles in accordance with the order in council and special survey plan, and duplicate indefeasible titles must, on request, be delivered to the registrar for similar correction.








Effect of registration





357



(1)


On registration of the order in council and plan, the plan of special survey becomes the official plan of the land comprised within the limits of the plan or part of it approved, and is binding on all persons, and all amounts of compensation, costs and expenses which by the terms of the order are charged against the registered owner of any parcel shown on the plan become a lien on that parcel respectively in favour of the government or the municipality, or the person entitled to receive it, as the case may be, and are assessable and collectable in the manner provided.






(2)


If the plan shows an increase in the area of a parcel, as compared with the original or previously existing survey or plan covering that parcel, the plan as registered operates as a conveyance to the registered owner of that parcel of the area added to that parcel by the taking effect of the plan of special survey free of all charges to which it may have been previously subject, but subject to all charges which exist against the parcel of which it becomes a part, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the order in council with which the plan is registered.








Notice of registration





358



On registration of the order in council and plan, the registrar must notify the proper officer that the order and plan have been registered, and must forward to the officer a copy of the order and a blue print of the plan as registered, which copy and blue print the minister must supply to the registrar for that purpose.








Assessment within municipalities





359



(1)


If the land affected is located within a municipality, and amounts of costs, expenses or fees have been charged by the terms of the order in council against the registered owners of parcels shown on the plan, the council of the municipality must by bylaw specially assess those parcels for the amounts charged against them respectively, and the following provisions apply to the special assessment:






(a)


the amounts assessed are payable in one payment or by annual instalments extending over a period not exceeding 10 years, as the council may prescribe;






(b)


in setting the amount of annual instalments a sum sufficient to cover interest on deferred payments at a rate not exceeding 8% per year must be added;






(c)


the council may prescribe terms and conditions on which any person whose parcel is specially assessed may commute by a payment in cash the annual instalments imposed on it;






(d)


every general or special Act applicable to the collection and recovery of taxes in the municipality and the proceedings which may be taken in default of payment apply to the special assessment and all amounts payable under it.






(2)


If compensation has been ordered to be paid to the municipality, the municipality may assess the parcels on which it is by this Part made a lien for the amount of the compensation, in the manner provided in subsection (1) for the assessment of the amounts of costs, expenses and fees.








Assessment in rural area





360



(1)


If the land affected is located in a rural area, and amounts of costs, expenses or fees have been charged by the terms of the order in council against the registered owners of any parcels shown on the plan, the Surveyor of Taxes must specially assess those parcels for the amounts charged against them respectively, and the following provisions apply to the special assessment:






(a)


the amounts assessed are payable in one payment, or, if directed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, may be made payable by annual instalments extending over a period not exceeding 10 years;






(b)


in setting the amount of annual instalments a sum sufficient to cover interest on deferred payments at a rate not exceeding 8% per year must be added;






(c)


the Lieutenant Governor in Council may prescribe terms and conditions on which any person whose parcel is specially assessed may commute by a payment in cash the annual instalments imposed on it;






(d)


any Act applicable to the collection and recovery of Provincial taxes imposed on land and proceedings which may be taken in default of payment apply to the special assessment and all amounts payable under it.






(2)


If compensation has been ordered to be paid to the Crown, the Surveyor of Taxes may assess the parcels on which it is by this Part made a lien for the amount of the compensation, in the same manner as provided in subsection (1) for the assessment of the amounts of costs, expenses and fees.








Duty of surveyor to destroy conflicting monuments





361



(1)


On receipt of notice from the minister of the taking effect of the order in council approving of a special survey under this Part, the surveyor who completed the survey must remove all survey posts, stakes or monuments standing or being on the land comprised within the limits of the survey prior to the special survey, and which are liable to lead to confusion in connection with the special survey.






(2)


If for any reason any existing post, stake or monument has been used or adopted by the surveyor as the post, stake or monument of the special survey, the surveyor must obliterate all marks on the post, stake or monument, except the marks placed on it or adopted by the surveyor in the making of the special survey.








Recovery of compensation and costs





362



If the order of the minister embodied in the order in council registered directs an amount of compensation to be charged to and payable by any person, the amount may be recovered by action in any court of competent jurisdiction as for a debt due to the person to whom it is directed to be paid, and the court may order a sale of the land affected to enforce the lien given by section 357.








Removal of special survey monuments





363



(1)


A person must not, unless acting under the written authority of the Surveyor General, pull down, deface, alter, remove or cover up or render inaccessible any special survey monument.






(2)


If in the carrying out of public or private works it is found necessary to remove or cover up or render inaccessible any special survey monument, the person carrying on the works may give the Surveyor General notice in writing that it is necessary to remove the special survey monument, and the Surveyor General must at once take the steps the Surveyor General deems necessary for ensuring the correct re-establishment of the special survey monument on the completion of the works, either at the place where it formerly stood or at another place the Surveyor General directs, and the entire cost and expenses incurred by the Surveyor General in connection with the removal and re-establishment of a special survey monument must be paid to the Surveyor General by the person at whose instance the removal of it is made, and may be recovered by action in any court as for a debt due to the government.






(3)


If the special survey monument is re-established at a place other than where it formerly stood, the Surveyor General must by notice in writing direct the registrar to make all notations on the registrar's records necessary to show the removal and re-establishment of that special survey monument.








Power of Lieutenant Governor in Council to correct errors





364



The Lieutenant Governor in Council may by order on the application of the municipal council of any municipality to which the plan of a special survey relates, after notice to all parties affected, and on terms and conditions the Lieutenant Governor in Council deems proper, amend a plan and a duplicate or copy of it, and may also by order correct a clerical error or omission appearing in the plan of any special survey, and in a copy or duplicate of it.

367



(1)


A patent may, subject to this section, be filed in the proper land title office.






(2)


The patent must not be filed unless and until the following have occurred:






(a)


Canada has, by enactment,






(i)


conferred on the band or its council the power to make laws authorizing the registration, in accordance with the Torrens system, of estates or interests in Indian land of the band, and for that purpose to make laws applying the Torrens system to that land, and

(d)


the patent is accompanied by

(ii)


a plan of the land described in the patent based on a survey, that complies with this Act and the rules made under section 385 (5), on which a certificate of a public officer of Canada has been endorsed certifying, to the satisfaction of the registrar, that the land shown in the plan represents all of the land described in the patent;






(e)


the patent preserves, excepts and reserves to and for the benefit of






(i)


the Province, and






(ii)


persons duly authorized by the Province


all rights, estates and interests held by, or reserved to, or arising in favour of, or exercisable by






(iii)


the Province, or






(iv)


persons duly authorized by the Province


in respect of the lands described in the patent, including all such rights, estates and interests that are held, reserved, or exercisable or that arise under or because of the following:






(v)


the order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, approved on July 29, 1938 (order in council 1036/38) as modified by the order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, approved on May 13, 1969 (order in council 1555/69);






(vi)


the order of the Governor General of Canada in Council, approved on February 3, 1930 (P.C. 208) and the memorandum of agreement entered into between the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Government of British Columbia, set out in the Schedule to the

Constitution Act, 1930

;






(vii)

(3)


The consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council under subsection (2) (g) is proof to the registrar that the requirements of subsection (2) have been met, and the registrar must, on the giving of that consent, file the patent and the certificate and plan referred to in subsection (2) (d) that accompanies the patent and must make a note of the filing in the records in the manner required by the director.






(4)


The filing of a patent under this section does not, of itself, constitute registration of an indefeasible title to the fee simple estate created or confirmed by the patent, but the filing is sufficient proof to the registrar that the band to which the patent granted the land has established a good, safeholding and marketable title, subject only to






(a)


in the case of land, the title to which is not registered under this Act at the time of filing, such other rights, estates and interests as are described in a certificate of encumbrances filed in support of an application under section 368 and that become registered under this Act, or






(b)


in the case of land, the title to which is registered under this Act at the time of filing, such other rights, estates and interests as are entered, noted or endorsed on the register or are subsequently described in a certificate of encumbrances and that become registered under this Act, and






(c)


in either case, such other rights, estates and interests as are referred to in subsection (2) (e) or section 23 (2) (a).








Application for registration of Indian land — general





368



(1)


If a patent grants or confirms Indian land in fee simple to a band, the band may apply to be registered as owner of an indefeasible title in fee simple to all or part of the land, subject to the estates and interests in the land described in the certificate of encumbrances.






(2)


An application under this section must not be received by the registrar unless






(a)


it is accompanied by a copy of a law of the band or its council authorizing the application that is in the form prescribed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council and is certified by a person designated as the authorized signatory of the band,






(b)


it is accompanied by a certificate of encumbrances in respect of the land affected by the application, and






(c)


a patent granting or confirming the Indian land in fee simple to the band has been filed under section 367.






(3)


The registrar may waive the requirement under section 366 (2) (c) for a plan if the application relates to land already described by a plan on deposit in the land title office at the time of the application and the registrar is of the opinion that no further plan or description of the land is necessary for the purpose of registering an indefeasible title to it.






(4)


In addition to the instruments referred to in this section, the registrar may require such further evidence as the registrar considers necessary to determine priorities among the subsisting estates and interests and the areas of the land affected by them.






(5)


Subject to section 370 (4), an estate or interest that






(a)


subsists at the time of an application under section 369 or 370, and






(b)


is not described in the certificate of encumbrances filed in support of the application


must not be registered.






(6)


Subsection (5) must not be construed as preventing or requiring the registration of rights of the Province referred to in section 23 (2) (a) or section 367 (2) (e), but those rights are valid and enforceable whether or not they are registered under this Act.






(7)


The registrar must not register a title claimed by the band in an application to which section 369 or 370 applies if the certificate of encumbrances filed in support of the application is dated earlier than the date the application is made, until the applicant files a further certificate of encumbrances dated no earlier than the date the application is made.






(8)


To the extent necessary to give effect to the application, the registrar may dispense with a requirement under section 156 (1) or (2).








Where application affects unregistered Indian land





369



(1)


If an application under section 368 relates to Indian land the title to which, at the time of the application, has not been registered under this Act, the registrar must, subject to this section, register the title claimed by the band.






(2)


If, on examination of the application, the registrar is of the opinion that an estate or interest referred to in the certificate of encumbrances






(a)


affects other unregistered land not included in the application, or






(b)


cannot, immediately on registration of the title claimed, be registered in compliance with section 73,


the registrar may defer consideration of the application until the applicant applies to register any further instruments that the registrar considers necessary to register the estate and interest as a charge in compliance with section 73.






(3)


If the registrar considers that an application to which this section applies raises a question of priorities, the registrar may, on notice to the applicant and to any other person the registrar deems necessary, defer registration of the title and the charge until the question has been resolved






(a)


by the court,






(b)


by agreement among the persons affected, or






(c)


in any other manner satisfactory to the registrar.






(4)


In the circumstances described in subsection (2), the registrar may cancel the application and give notice of its cancellation to the applicant.






(5)


If the certificate of encumbrances filed in support of the application describes a subsisting estate or interest to which the fee simple estate in the land described in the application is or may be subject, the registrar must, on receipt of the application, file a caveat against it and, until the caveat is cancelled or expires, the title applied for or any estate or interest in the land must not be registered.






(6)


The registrar may, after the caveat is filed, order the applicant to serve, on each owner of an estate or interest described in the certificate of encumbrances, a notice of the application under section 368, and the notice must






(a)


contain a description of the land,






(b)


state that the owner may, subject to this Act, apply for registration of the estate or interest as a charge, and






(c)


be accompanied by a true copy of this section and of the certificate of encumbrances,


and unless the applicant has, before the expiration of the caveat, filed proof, satisfactory to the registrar, of the date on which the notice was personally served or, if the registrar has ordered another method of service, that the notice was served in accordance with that other method, the registrar must cancel the application.






(7)


The owner of an estate or interest described in the certificate of encumbrances may, despite the caveat, apply for registration of the estate or interest as a charge.






(8)


The registrar must cancel a caveat filed under subsection (5) if, in respect of each and every subsisting estate and interest described in the certificate of encumbrances that gave rise to the caveat, one of the following events has occurred:






(a)


an application to register it as a charge has been made by the owner of it and the registrar considers that the charge may be properly registered;






(b)


a public officer of Canada duly authorized to do so has delivered to the registrar a certificate signed by the public officer stating that the estate or interest described in the certificate of encumbrances and identified in the certificate no longer affects the land;






(c)


a person to whom a notice respecting a particular estate or interest has been given has delivered to the registrar a surrender or quit claim of the person's estate or interest that is sufficient to extinguish it.






(9)


A caveat filed under this section by the registrar expires, unless it has been earlier cancelled under subsection (8), on the later of the following dates:






(a)


the date that is 180 days after the date the caveat was filed;






(b)


the date that is 180 days after the date when a notice referred to in subsection (6) has in accordance with that subsection been served on all the persons on whom the notice was directed to be served.






(10)


An estate or interest described in the certificate of encumbrances must not be registered as a charge






(a)


if the description of the land affected by the instrument creating the charge is not, in the opinion of the registrar, sufficient to identify the land in the records,






(b)


in contravention of section 73,






(c)


if an indefeasible title to the whole of the land affected by the charge is not then registered, or






(d)


if the estate or interest is otherwise not capable of registration.






(11)


The priority of an estate or interest referred to in subsection (5) in respect of which registration has been applied for before the cancellation or expiration of the caveat filed under this section must, subject to a contrary intention appearing from the instrument creating the estate or interest, be according to the date of execution of that instrument and not according to the date and time of the application for registration of it as a charge.






(12)


Section 28 applies in respect of an estate or interest referred to in subsection (5) in respect of which application for registration has not been made before the expiration of the caveat filed under this section.








If application affects registered Indian land





370



(1)


If an application under section 368 relates to Indian land, the title to which is, at the time of the application, already registered under this Act, the registrar must, subject to this section, cancel the previously registered title and register a new title in the name of the band.






(2)


The registrar must not register the title claimed in the application unless the registrar is satisfied that the land described in the patent includes all of the land covered by the previously registered title and the certificate of encumbrances filed in support of the application satisfies the requirements of section 366 (2) (b).






(3)


If, in the opinion of the registrar, an application to which this section applies is affected by an estate or interest described in the certificate of encumbrances that is not then entered, noted or endorsed in the register,






(a)


section 369 (5) to (10) applies with respect to that estate or interest, and






(b)


on registration of the estate or interest, its priority must be determined in accordance with section 28.






(4)


An interest or estate that is entered, noted or endorsed on the previously registered title at the time of the application under section 368 is not affected by the absence of any reference to it in the patent or certificate of encumbrances or, where there is a reference to it, by any inconsistency between that reference and the register.






(5)


This section does not operate to permit a subdivision of the land covered by the previously registered title otherwise than in compliance with this Act.






(6)


The registrar must not register any dealings in Indian land that, on the coming into force of this section, is already registered under this Act, until a new title to that land is registered under subsection (1).






(7)


Subsection (6) does not






(a)


apply to a dealing by the owner of an estate or interest that is registered as a charge on the previously registered title, or






(b)


operate to prevent the registration of a judgment, claim of lien under the


Builders Lien Act


, caveat, certificate of pending litigation or other involuntary charge.








Other laws not to affect Torrens system





371



(1)


For the purpose of applying the Torrens system to Indian land the registrar is not under any duty to take notice of, act on, inquire into or give effect to any enactment of Canada or to any law of a band or its council that






(a)


relates to the registration of title to, rights in, claims against or estates or interests in land, whether legal or equitable, or the creation, conveyancing, transmission, inheritance, devolution or enforcement of them,






(b)


creates a trust or fiduciary duty in the band to hold land for the use and benefit of itself and its members, or






(c)


expressly or by necessary implication requires the registrar to perform a duty or exercise a power that the registrar would not otherwise be required to perform or exercise with respect to the land if it were not Indian land.






(2)


Nothing in subsection (1) is to be construed or operates to prevent






(a)


the exercise by the Province or by persons duly authorized by the Province, or






(b)


effect being given to,


any right, estate or interest referred to in section 367 (2) (e).






(3)


An estate or interest in land claimed or asserted by any person claiming to be the beneficial owner of land under a trust or fiduciary duty referred to in subsection (1) (b) must not be registered under this Act.






(4)


If a band or its council






(a)


amends all or part of a law required by section 367 (2) (b) or 368 (2) (a) without first receiving the written approval of the minister, or






(b)


repeals all or part of a law referred to in paragraph (a),


the registrar must






(c)


lodge a caveat against all indefeasible titles to Indian land of that band,






(d)


not register any other instruments affecting the Indian land of that band, and






(e)


not accept any application to register any other instrument affecting the Indian land of that band,


and any application affecting the Indian land of that band that is then pending is void.








Execution of instruments





372



(1)


For the purpose of applying the Torrens system to Indian land and to dealings in other land of a band to which section 373.1 applies, an instrument executed by or on behalf of a band or its council is conclusively deemed to be properly executed if






(a)


the seal of the band or its council is affixed to the instrument in the presence of a person described as an authorized signatory, and






(b)


execution is proved in the same manner as is provided in section 46, in cases of execution by a corporation.






(2)


An instrument executed and proved in compliance with subsection (1) constitutes conclusive proof to the registrar that the requirements of the constitution of the band and laws of the band or its council relating to the execution of the instrument and the disposition contemplated by it have been fulfilled.






(3)


If an instrument executed by or on behalf of a band is presented for registration under this Act, the registrar need not act on, inquire into or give effect to the constitution of the band or to any law of the band or its council, or make any inquiry into the capacity of either of them or make any other inquiry into whether or not






(a)


the constitution of the band or any law of the band or its council is in force,






(b)


the transaction contemplated by the instrument was duly authorized in accordance with the constitution of the band or the laws of the band or its council,






(c)


all rules and procedures established by the band or its council respecting the disposition of an estate or interest in land have been complied with, or






(d)


the band subsists as a legal entity.








Liability limited





373

(a)


occasioned to or suffered by a person entitled to an estate or interest in Indian land that subsisted at the time an application under section 368 is made, as a result of the operation of this Part,






(b)

Effect of indefeasible title to treaty lands





2

(a)


the subsisting conditions, provisos, restrictions, including restrictions on alienation, exceptions and reservations, including royalties, set out in a certificate of the treaty first nation under section 25 (3) or 27 (1) (a) (ii) (A) of this Schedule, as the case may be, relating to that parcel;

Matters to be considered by approving officer on application for approval

Section 87 of this Act does not apply in relation to treaty lands.






(2)


Without limiting section 85 (3) of this Act, in considering an application for subdivision approval in respect of a parcel of treaty lands, the approving officer may refuse to approve the subdivision if the approving officer considers that the subdivision does not comply with the laws of the treaty first nation.
