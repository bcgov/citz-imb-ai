at least 31 days after mailing or delivering a copy of the certificate to the client under subsection (2), may file that certificate in the Supreme Court, and

A lien may be registered under subsection (2)

by registering a certificate of lien, in the prescribed form,

in the appropriate land title office,






(ii)


in the same manner that a charge is registered under the

, and






(iii)


without fee for registration under the


Land Title Act


, and






(b)


whether or not the society has issued or filed a certificate under section 13.






(4)


Registration of a certificate of lien against land under this section creates a lien in favour of the society on the client's interest in the land against which the registration is made.






(5)


Subject to section 16, the lien referred to in subsection (4) is security, ranking in priority to any charge registered after the lien is registered, for the whole of the client's financial obligation to the society,






(a)


whether some or all of that financial obligation to the society arose before or after the registration of the lien,






(b)


whether some or all of that financial obligation to the society arose before or after the registration of any charge registered after the registration of the lien,






(c)


whether the society issued or filed one or more certificates under section 13 for some or all of that financial obligation to the society, and

whether the society realized, through execution on a filed certificate, some or all of the amount set out in the certificate.

the society may register the registrable interest as a claim under and in accordance with the

Miscellaneous Registrations Act

, 1992, and






(c)


the registrable interest arises immediately prior to its registration as a claim.






(3)


Registration of the registrable interest as a claim against personal property under subsection (2) creates a lien in favour of the society on the client's interest in that personal property.






(4)


Subject to section 16, the lien referred to in subsection (3) is security, having the same priority in relation to the personal property that is subject to the lien as would a security interest in that property that was perfected under the

(a)


whether some or all of that financial obligation to the society arose before or after the creation of the lien,

(c)


whether the society issued or filed one or more certificates under section 13 of this Act for some or all of that financial obligation to the society, and






(d)


whether the society realised, through execution on a filed certificate, some or all of the amount set out in the certificate.

in the opinion of the society, the matter in respect of which the legal aid contract was entered into with the client is concluded, and

(7)
