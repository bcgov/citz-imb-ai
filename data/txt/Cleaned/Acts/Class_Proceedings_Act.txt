Part 2 — Certification







Plaintiff's class proceeding





2



(1)


A resident of British Columbia who is a member of a class of persons may commence a proceeding in the court on behalf of the members of that class.






(2)


The member who commences a proceeding under subsection (1) must






(a)


make an application to the court for an order






(i)


certifying the proceeding as a class proceeding, and






(ii)


subject to subsection (4), appointing the member as the representative plaintiff for the class proceeding, and






(b)


give notice of the application for certification to






(i)


the representative plaintiff for any multi-jurisdictional class proceeding, and






(ii)


the representative plaintiff for any proposed multi-jurisdictional class proceeding


that has been commenced elsewhere in Canada and that involves the same or similar subject matter.






(3)


An application under subsection (2) must be made






(a)


within 90 days after the later of






(i)


the date on which the last response to civil claim was served, and






(ii)


the date on which the period prescribed by the Supreme Court Civil Rules for service of the last response to a notice of civil claim expires without that pleading having been served, or






(b)


at any other time, with leave of the court.






(4)


The court may certify a person who is not a member of the class as the representative plaintiff for the class proceeding only if it is necessary to do so in order to avoid a substantial injustice to the class.








Defendant's class proceeding





3



A defendant to 2 or more proceedings may, at any stage of one of the proceedings, make an application to a judge of the court for an order certifying the proceedings as a class proceeding and appointing a representative plaintiff.








Plaintiff in other proceeding may appear





3.1



A person who receives notice of an application for certification under section 2 (2) (b) may make submissions at the certification hearing.








Class certification





4



(1)


Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the court must certify a proceeding as a class proceeding on an application under section 2 or 3 if all of the following requirements are met:






(a)


the pleadings disclose a cause of action;






(b)


there is an identifiable class of 2 or more persons;






(c)


the claims of the class members raise common issues, whether or not those common issues predominate over issues affecting only individual members;






(d)


a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the fair and efficient resolution of the common issues;






(e)


there is a representative plaintiff who






(i)


would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class,






(ii)


has produced a plan for the proceeding that sets out a workable method of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the class and of notifying class members of the proceeding, and






(iii)


does not have, on the common issues, an interest that is in conflict with the interests of other class members.






(2)


In determining whether a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the fair and efficient resolution of the common issues, the court must consider all relevant matters including the following:






(a)


whether questions of fact or law common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members;






(b)


whether a significant number of the members of the class have a valid interest in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions;






(c)


whether the class proceeding would involve claims that are or have been the subject of any other proceedings;






(d)


whether other means of resolving the claims are less practical or less efficient;






(e)


whether the administration of the class proceeding would create greater difficulties than those likely to be experienced if relief were sought by other means.






(3)


If a multi-jurisdictional class proceeding or a proposed multi-jurisdictional class proceeding has been commenced elsewhere in Canada and involves the same or similar subject matter to that of the proceeding being considered for certification, the court must determine whether it would be preferable for some or all of the claims of the proposed class members, or some or all of the common issues raised by those claims, to be resolved in the proceeding commenced elsewhere.






(4)


When making a determination under subsection (3), the court must






(a)


be guided by the following objectives:






(i)


to ensure that the interests of all parties in each of the relevant jurisdictions are given due consideration;






(ii)


to ensure that the ends of justice are served;






(iii)


to avoid irreconcilable judgments, if possible;






(iv)


to promote judicial economy, and






(b)


consider relevant factors, including the following:






(i)


the alleged basis of liability, including the applicable laws;






(ii)


the stage that each of the proceedings has reached;






(iii)


the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class proceeding, including the viability of the plan and the capacity and resources for advancing the proceeding on behalf of the proposed class;






(iv)


the location of class members and representative plaintiffs in each of the proceedings, including the ability of representative plaintiffs to participate in the proceedings and to represent the interests of class members;






(v)


the location of evidence and witnesses.








Orders in multi-jurisdictional certification





4.1



(1)


The court may make any order it considers appropriate in an application to certify a multi-jurisdictional class proceeding, including an order






(a)


certifying the proceeding as a multi-jurisdictional class proceeding, if






(i)


the requirements in section 4 (1) are met, and






(ii)


the court determines, having regard to section 4 (2) and (3), that British Columbia is the appropriate venue for the multi-jurisdictional class proceeding,






(b)


refusing to certify the proceeding, if the court determines that it should proceed as a multi-jurisdictional class proceeding in another jurisdiction, or






(c)


refusing to certify a portion of a proposed class, if that portion of the class contains members who may be included within a proposed class proceeding in another jurisdiction.






(2)


If the court certifies a multi-jurisdictional class proceeding, it may






(a)


divide the class into resident and non-resident subclasses,






(b)


appoint a separate representative plaintiff for each subclass, and






(c)


specify the manner in which and the time within which members of each subclass may opt out of the proceeding.








Certification application





5



(1)


An application for a certification order under section 2 (2) or 3 must be supported by an affidavit of the applicant.






(2)


A copy of the notice of application and supporting affidavit must be filed and






(a)


served by ordinary service on all persons by whom or on whose behalf a pleading has been filed in the proceeding, and






(b)


served by personal service on any other persons named in the style of proceedings.






(3)


Unless otherwise ordered, there must be at least 14 days between






(a)


the service of a notice of application and supporting affidavit, and






(b)


the day named in the notice of application for the hearing.






(4)


Unless otherwise ordered, a person to whom a notice of application and affidavit is served under this section must, not less than 5 days or such other period as the court may order before the date of the hearing of the application, file an affidavit and serve a copy of the filed affidavit by ordinary service on all persons by whom or on whose behalf a pleading has been filed in the proceeding.






(5)


A person filing an affidavit under subsection (2) or (4) must






(a)


set out in the affidavit the material facts on which the person intends to rely at the hearing of the application,






(b)


swear that the person knows of no fact material to the application that has not been disclosed in the person's affidavit or in any affidavits previously filed in the proceeding, and






(c)


provide the person's best information on the number of members in the proposed class.






(6)


The court may adjourn the application for certification to permit the parties to amend their materials or pleadings or to permit further evidence.






(7)


An order certifying a proceeding as a class proceeding is not a determination of the merits of the proceeding.








Subclass certification





6



(1)


Despite section 4 (1), if a class includes a subclass whose members have claims that raise common issues not shared by all the class members so that, in the opinion of the court, the protection of the interests of the subclass members requires that they be separately represented, the court must not certify the proceeding as a class proceeding unless there is, in addition to the representative plaintiff for the class, a representative plaintiff who






(a)


would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the subclass,






(b)


has produced a plan for the proceeding that sets out a workable method of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the subclass and of notifying subclass members of the proceeding, and






(c)


does not have, on the common issues for the subclass, an interest that is in conflict with the interests of other subclass members.






(2)


[Repealed 2018-16-6.]








Certain matters not bar to certification





7



The court must not refuse to certify a proceeding as a class proceeding merely because of one or more of the following:






(a)

(b)


the relief claimed relates to separate contracts involving different class members;






(c)


different remedies are sought for different class members;

include any other provisions the court considers appropriate.






(2)


If a class includes a subclass whose members have claims that raise common issues not shared by all the class members so that, in the opinion of the court, the protection of the interests of the subclass members requires that they be separately represented, the certification order must include the same information in relation to the subclass that, under subsection (1), is required in relation to the class.






(3)


The court, on the application of a party or class member, may at any time amend a certification order.








Refusal to certify





9

(a)


order the addition, deletion or substitution of parties,






(b)


order the amendment of the pleadings, and






(c)


make any other order that it considers appropriate.








If conditions for certification not satisfied





10



(1)


Without limiting section 8 (3), at any time after a certification order is made under this Part, the court may amend the certification order, decertify the proceeding or make any other order it considers appropriate if it appears to the court that the conditions mentioned in section 4 or 6 (1) are not satisfied with respect to a class proceeding.






(2)


If the court makes a decertification order under subsection (1), the court may permit the proceeding to continue as one or more proceedings between different parties and may make any order referred to in section 9 (a) to (c) in relation to each of those proceedings.

(b)


the presence of subclasses;






(c)


whether the discovery is necessary in view of the defences of the party seeking leave;

Part 4 — Orders, Awards and Related Procedures




Division 1 — Order on Common Issues and Individual Issues







Contents of order on common issues





25



An order made in respect of a judgment on common issues of a class or subclass must






(a)


set out the common issues,






(b)


name or describe the class or subclass members to the extent possible,






(c)


state the nature of the claims asserted on behalf of the class or subclass, and






(d)


specify the relief granted.








Judgment on common issues is binding





26



(1)


A judgment on common issues of a class or subclass binds every member of the class or subclass, as the case may be, who has not opted out of the class proceeding, but only to the extent that the judgment determines common issues that






(a)


are set out in the certification order,






(b)


relate to claims described in the certification order, and






(c)


relate to relief sought by the class or subclass as stated in the certification order.






(2)


A judgment on common issues of a class or subclass does not bind a party to the class proceeding in any subsequent proceeding between the party and a person who opted out of the class proceedings.








Determination of individual issues





27



(1)


When the court determines common issues in favour of a class or subclass and determines that there are issues, other than those that may be determined under section 32, that are applicable only to certain individual members of the class or subclass, the court may






(a)


determine those individual issues in further hearings presided over by the judge who determined the common issues or by another judge of the court,






(b)


appoint one or more persons including, without limitation, one or more independent experts, to conduct an inquiry into those individual issues under the Supreme Court Civil Rules and report back to the court, or






(c)


with the consent of the parties, direct that those individual issues be determined in any other manner.






(2)


The court may give any necessary directions relating to the procedures that must be followed in conducting hearings, inquiries and determinations under subsection (1).






(3)


In giving directions under subsection (2), the court must choose the least expensive and most expeditious method of determining the individual issues that is consistent with justice to members of the class or subclass and the parties and, in doing so, the court may






(a)


dispense with any procedural step that it considers unnecessary, and






(b)


authorize any special procedural steps, including steps relating to discovery, and any special rules, including rules relating to admission of evidence and means of proof, that it considers appropriate.






(4)


The court must set a reasonable time within which individual members of the class or subclass may make claims under this section in respect of the individual issues.






(5)


A member of the class or subclass who fails to make a claim within the time set under subsection (4) must not later make a claim under this section in respect of the issues applicable only to that member except with leave of the court.






(6)


The court may grant leave under subsection (5) if it is satisfied that






(a)


there are apparent grounds for relief,






(b)


the delay was not caused by any fault of the person seeking the relief, and






(c)


the defendant would not suffer substantial prejudice if leave were granted.






(7)


Unless otherwise ordered by the court making a direction under subsection (1) (c), a determination of issues made in accordance with subsection (1) (c) is deemed to be an order of the court.








Individual assessment of liability





28



Without limiting section 27, if, after determining common issues in favour of a class or subclass, the court determines that the defendant's liability to individual class members cannot reasonably be determined without proof by those individual class members, section 27 applies to the determination of the defendant's liability to those class members.





Division 2 — Aggregate Awards







Aggregate awards of monetary relief





29



(1)


The court may make an order for an aggregate monetary award in respect of all or any part of a defendant's liability to class members and may give judgment accordingly if






(a)


monetary relief is claimed on behalf of some or all class members,






(b)


no questions of fact or law other than those relating to the assessment of monetary relief remain to be determined in order to establish the amount of the defendant's monetary liability, and






(c)


the aggregate or a part of the defendant's liability to some or all class members can reasonably be determined without proof by individual class members.






(2)


Before making an order under subsection (1), the court must provide the defendant with an opportunity to make submissions to the court in respect of any matter touching on the proposed order including, without limitation,






(a)


submissions that contest the merits or amount of an award under that subsection, and






(b)


submissions that individual proof of monetary relief is required due to the individual nature of the relief.








Statistical evidence may be used





30



(1)


For the purposes of determining issues relating to the amount or distribution of an aggregate monetary award under this Act, the court may admit as evidence statistical information that would not otherwise be admissible as evidence, including information derived from sampling, if the information was compiled in accordance with principles that are generally accepted by experts in the field of statistics.






(2)


A record of statistical information purporting to be prepared by or published under the authority of the Parliament of Canada or the legislature of any province or territory of Canada may be admitted as evidence without proof of its authenticity.






(3)


Statistical information must not be admitted as evidence under this section unless the party seeking to introduce the information






(a)


has given to the party against whom the statistical evidence is to be used a copy of the information at least 60 days before that information is to be introduced as evidence,






(b)


has complied with subsections (4) and (5), and






(c)


introduces the evidence by an expert who is available for cross-examination on that evidence.






(4)


Notice under this section must specify the source of any statistical information sought to be introduced that






(a)


was prepared or published under the authority of the Parliament of Canada or the legislature of any province or territory of Canada,






(b)


was derived from market quotations, tabulations, lists, directories or other compilations generally used and relied on by members of the public, or






(c)


was derived from reference material generally used and relied on by members of an occupational group.






(5)


Except with respect to information referred to in subsection (4), notice under this section must






(a)


specify the name and qualifications of each person who supervised the preparation of the statistical information sought to be introduced, and






(b)


describe any documents prepared or used in the course of preparing the statistical information sought to be introduced.






(6)


Unless this section provides otherwise, the law and practice with respect to evidence tendered by an expert in a proceeding applies to a class proceeding.






(7)


Except with respect to information referred to in subsection (4), a party against whom statistical information is sought to be introduced under this section may require the party seeking to introduce it to produce for inspection any document that was prepared or used in the course of preparing the information, unless the document discloses the identity of persons responding to a survey who have not consented in writing to the disclosure.








Average or proportional share of aggregate awards





31



(1)


If the court makes an order under section 29, the court may further order that all or a part of the aggregate monetary award be applied so that some or all individual class or subclass members share in the award on an average or proportional basis if






(a)


it would be impractical or inefficient to






(i)


identify the class or subclass members entitled to share in the award, or






(ii)


determine the exact shares that should be allocated to individual class or subclass members, and






(b)


failure to make an order under this subsection would deny recovery to a substantial number of class or subclass members.






(2)


If an order is made under subsection (1), any member of the class or subclass in respect of which the order was made may, within the time specified in the order, apply to the court to be excluded from the proposed distribution and to be given the opportunity to prove that member's claim on an individual basis.






(3)


In deciding whether to exclude a class or subclass member from an average distribution, the court must consider






(a)


the extent to which the class or subclass member's individual claim varies from the average for the class or subclass,






(b)


the number of class or subclass members seeking to be excluded from an average distribution, and






(c)


whether excluding the class or subclass members referred to in paragraph (b) would unreasonably deplete the amount to be distributed on an average basis.






(4)


An amount recovered by a class or subclass member who proves that member's claim on an individual basis must be deducted from the amount to be distributed on an average basis before the distribution.








Individual share of aggregate award





32



(1)


When the court orders that all or a part of an aggregate monetary award under section 29 (1) be divided among individual class or subclass members on an individual basis, the court must determine whether individual claims need to be made to give effect to the order.






(2)


If the court determines under subsection (1) that individual claims need to be made, the court must specify the procedures for determining the claims.






(3)


In specifying the procedures under subsection (2), the court must minimize the burden on class or subclass members and, for that purpose, the court may authorize






(a)


the use of standard proof of claim forms,






(b)


the submission of affidavit or other documentary evidence, and






(c)


the auditing of claims on a sampling or other basis.






(4)


When specifying the procedures under subsection (2), the court must set a reasonable time within which individual class or subclass members may make claims under this section.






(5)


A class or subclass member who fails to make a claim within the time set under subsection (4) must not later make a claim under this section except with leave of the court.






(6)


Section 27 (6) applies to a decision whether to grant leave under subsection (5) of this section.






(7)


The court may amend a judgment given under section 29 (1) to give effect to a claim made with leave under subsection (5) of this section if the court considers it appropriate to do so.








Distribution





33



(1)


The court may direct any means of distribution of amounts awarded under this Division that it considers appropriate.






(2)


In giving directions under subsection (1), the court may order that






(a)


the defendant distribute directly to the class or subclass members the amount of monetary relief to which each class or subclass member is entitled by any means authorized by the court, including abatement and credit,






(b)


the defendant pay into court or some other appropriate depository the total amount of the defendant's liability to the class or subclass members until further order of the court, or






(c)


any person other than the defendant distribute directly to each of the class or subclass members, by any means authorized by the court, the amount of monetary relief to which that class or subclass member is entitled.






(3)


In deciding whether to make an order under subsection (2) (a), the court






(a)


must consider whether distribution by the defendant is the most practical way of distributing the award, and






(b)


may take into account whether the amount of monetary relief to which each class or subclass member is entitled can be determined from the records of the defendant.






(4)


The court must supervise the execution of judgments and the distribution of awards under this Division and may stay the whole or any part of an execution or distribution for a reasonable period on the terms it considers appropriate.






(5)


The court may order that an award made under this Division be paid






(a)


in a lump sum, promptly or within a time set by the court, or






(b)


in instalments, on the terms the court considers appropriate.






(6)


The court may






(a)


order that the costs of distributing an award under this Division, including the costs of any notice associated with the distribution and the fees payable to a person administering the distribution, be paid out of the proceeds of the judgment, and
