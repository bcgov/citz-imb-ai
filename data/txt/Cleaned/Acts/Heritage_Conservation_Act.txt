Without limiting subsection (4), the minister may require payment of a prescribed fee to inspect the information in the Provincial heritage register.






(6)


Protection of a heritage site or heritage object is not affected by an error or omission in the Provincial heritage register or, except for a Provincial heritage site or Provincial heritage object, by a failure to register property in the Provincial heritage register.








Agreements with first nations





4



(1)


The Province may enter into a formal agreement with a first nation with respect to the conservation and protection of heritage sites and heritage objects that represent the cultural heritage of the aboriginal people who are represented by that first nation.






(2)


An agreement under subsection (1) must be in writing and must be approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.






(3)


Subsection (2) does not apply to an agreement that is entered into under section 20 (1) (b).






(4)


Without limiting subsection (1), an agreement made under this section may include one or more of the following:






(a)


a schedule of heritage sites and heritage objects that are of particular spiritual, ceremonial or other cultural value to the aboriginal people for the purpose of protection under section 12.1 (2) (h);

Act is binding on the government

Despite section 14 (2) of the


Interpretation Act


, this Act and the regulations and orders made under it are binding on the government.








Act prevails over conflicting legislation





6



If, with respect to any matter affecting the conservation of a heritage site or heritage object referred to in section 12.1 (2), there is a conflict between this Act and any other Act, this Act prevails.








Provincial heritage policies





7



(1)


The minister may, with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, establish policies and standards for the identification, conservation, management and disposition of any heritage site or heritage object owned or managed by the government.

Despite subsection (1), policies and standards established by the Haida Gwaii Management Council under section 7 (2) of the


Haida Gwaii Reconciliation Act


for the identification and conservation of heritage sites within the management area, as defined in section 1 (1) of that Act, must be given effect in that management area as if they were policies and standards established under subsection (1) of this section.








No derogation of aboriginal and treaty rights





8



For greater certainty, no provision of this Act and no provision in an agreement entered into under section 4 abrogates or derogates from the aboriginal and treaty rights of a first nation or of any aboriginal peoples.








Application of Act to treaty lands





8.1



If a treaty first nation, in accordance with its final agreement, makes laws for the conservation and protection of, and access to, heritage sites and heritage objects on its treaty lands, sections 9, 12.1 to 12.8, 16.1, 18 and 20 (1) (a) do not apply in relation to those treaty lands.

Miscellaneous Registrations Act, 1992


.






(7)


No designation is invalid because of inadvertent and minor non-compliance with this section.








Compensation for heritage designation





11



(1)


If a designation under section 9 causes, or will cause at the time of designation, a reduction in the market value of the designated property, the government must compensate an owner of the designated property who makes an application under subsection (2), and the compensation must be in an amount or in a form the minister and the owner agree on or, failing an agreement, in an amount or in a form determined by binding arbitration under subsection (4).

If the minister and the owner are unable to agree

on the amount or form of compensation,


then either the minister or the owner may refer the matter to binding arbitration under the

.






(5)


An arbitration under this section must be by a single arbitrator unless the minister and the owner agree to the appointment of an arbitration panel.

the Lieutenant Governor in Council does not make the designation.






(8)


Nothing in this section authorizes the government to give any financial or other benefit to an owner except that which is commensurate with the reduction in market value of the designated property as caused by that designation.






(9)


Compensation under this section only applies to property that is designated as a Provincial heritage site or a Provincial heritage object under section 9 and does not apply in the case of property that, immediately before a designation under section 9, is

already designated as a Provincial heritage site under section 9 or a Provincial heritage property under section 11.1,
