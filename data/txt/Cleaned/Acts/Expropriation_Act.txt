Part 6 — Basis For Compensation







Definition





29



In this Part,

"date of expropriation"

means the date the vesting notice is filed in the land title office under section 23.








Right to compensation





30



(1)


Every owner of land that is expropriated is entitled to compensation, to be determined in accordance with this Act.






(2)


If the amount of compensation determined under this Act is less than






(a)


the amount paid under section 20, or






(b)


any other amount paid by the expropriating authority on account of compensation,


the court must order the amount of the difference as payable to the expropriating authority by the owner to whom the overpayment was made.






(3)


Nothing in this Part affects the limitations on compensation provided for by section 121 of the


Forest Act


.








Basic formula





31



(1)


The court must award as compensation to an owner the market value of the owner's estate or interest in the expropriated land plus reasonable damages for disturbance but, if the market value is based on a use of the land other than its use at the date of expropriation, the compensation payable is the greater of






(a)


the market value of the land based on its use at the date of expropriation plus reasonable damages under section 34, and






(b)


the market value of the land based on its highest and best use at the date of expropriation.






(2)


If not included in the market value of land determined in accordance with section 32, the following must be added to that market value:






(a)


the value of a special economic advantage to the owner arising out of the owner's occupation or use of the land;






(b)


the value of improvements made by an owner occupying a residence located on the land.






(3)


If there is more than one separate interest in the land expropriated, the value of each interest must, if practical, be established separately.








Definition of market value





32



The market value of an estate or interest in land is the amount that would have been paid for it if it had been sold at the date of expropriation in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.








Exclusions from market value





33



In determining the market value of land, account must not be taken of






(a)


the anticipated or actual purpose for which the expropriating authority intends to use the land,






(b)


an increase in the value of the land resulting from a use that, at the date of expropriation, was capable of being restrained by a court,






(c)


an increase in the value of the land resulting from improvements made to the land after the expropriation notice under section 6 (1) (a) or order under section 5 (4) (a) has been served, but not including improvements that are necessary to preserve the value or state of the land,






(d)


an increase or decrease in the value of the land resulting from the development or prospect of the development in respect of which the expropriation is made,






(e)


an increase or decrease in the value of the land resulting from any expropriation or prospect of expropriation,






(f)


an increase or decrease in the value of the land due to development of other land that forms part of the development for which the expropriated land is taken, or






(g)


any increase or decrease in value of the land that results from the enactment or amendment of a zoning bylaw, official community plan or analogous enactment made with a view to the development in respect of which the expropriation is made.








Disturbance damages generally





34



(1)


An owner whose land is expropriated is entitled to disturbance damages consisting of the following:






(a)


reasonable costs, expenses and financial losses that are directly attributable to the disturbance caused to the owner by the expropriation;






(b)


reasonable costs of relocating on other land, including reasonable moving, legal and survey costs that are necessarily incurred in acquiring a similar interest or estate in the other land.






(2)


If a cost, expense or loss is claimed as a disturbance damage and that cost, expense or loss has not yet been incurred, either the claimant or the expropriating authority may, with the consent of the court, elect to have the cost, expense or loss determined at the time, not more than 6 months after the date of expropriation, that the cost, expense or loss is incurred.






(3)


If an owner whose land is expropriated carried on a business on that land at the date of expropriation and, after the date of expropriation, relocates the business to and operates it from other land, reasonable business losses directly attributable to the expropriation must not, unless that person and the expropriating authority otherwise agree, be determined until the earlier of






(a)


6 months after the owner has operated the business from the other land, and






(b)


one year after the date of the expropriation.






(4)


If the court determines that it is not feasible for an owner to relocate the owner's business, there may be included in the compensation that is otherwise payable, an additional amount not exceeding the value of the goodwill of the business.








Limited market — churches, hospitals, schools, etc.





35



(1)


Unless an owner elects to be paid compensation in accordance with the other provisions of this Part, the market value of the owner's estate or interest in the land is deemed to be the reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement if, at the date of expropriation,






(a)


the land is used for a church, hospital, school or similar use for which there is no general demand or market, and






(b)


the owner undertakes with the expropriating authority that it will relocate and continue the same use on other land.






(2)


In determining the reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement under subsection (1), depreciation of a building on the expropriated land must not be taken into account if the building was being used for the particular use referred to in subsection (1) on the date the expropriation notice under section 6 (1) (a) or order under section 5 (4) (a) was served.






(3)


For the purposes of this section, the reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement must be determined as of the date that the owner obtains, through purchase or construction, reasonably equivalent lands and improvements, but in no case later than one year after the date of expropriation.








Frustration of leases





36



(1)


A lease is deemed to be frustrated if, at the date of expropriation,






(a)


the entire interest or estate of a lessee in land is expropriated, or






(b)


part of the interest or estate of a lessee in land is expropriated, and the expropriation renders the remaining interest or estate of the lessee unfit for the purposes of the lease.






(2)


Subject to subsection (1), if part of the interest or estate in land of a lessee is expropriated, the obligation of the lessee to pay rent under the lease is, to the extent of the interest or estate expropriated, abated.






(3)


If there is an inconsistency between a provision of a lease and subsection (1) or (2), that subsection prevails.








Market value of security interests





37



If land subject to a security interest is expropriated, compensation must be determined in the manner and amounts prescribed.








Occupiers and lessees





38



(1)


If expropriated land includes a residence that is






(a)


occupied by a person who, in respect of that residence, would be entitled to a grant under the


Home Owner Grant Act


, and






(b)


not being offered for sale by the person on the date the expropriation notice under section 6 (1) (a) or order under section 5 (4) (a) was served on the person,


the person is entitled to be paid, in addition to the amount required to be paid to the person under section 34, an amount equivalent to 5% of the market value of the person's estate or interest in that part of the land, not exceeding 0.5 ha, that is used personally by the person for residential purposes.






(2)


If expropriated land includes a rental unit as defined in the


Residential Tenancy Act


or a manufactured home site as defined in the


Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act


, a person who leases or occupies the unit or site under an agreement that has a term of less than one year is entitled to be paid






(a)


an amount that is equivalent to 3 months' rent for the rental unit or manufactured home site, and






(b)


reasonable moving costs.








Disturbance damages for lessees





39



If land that is subject to a lease having a term greater than one year is expropriated, the lessee, whether or not the lessee is an occupant of the land, is entitled to reasonable disturbance damages in an amount to be determined by the court by having regard to






(a)


the length of the term of the lease,






(b)


the length of the unexpired term of the lease,






(c)


any rights to renew or the reasonable prospect of renewal,






(d)


the nature of the business, if any, carried out on the land under the lease, and






(e)


the extent of the lessee's investment in the land that the lessee cannot reasonably recover.








Partial takings





40



(1)


Subject to section 44, if part of the land of an owner is expropriated, the owner is entitled to compensation for






(a)


the market value of the owner's estate or interest in the expropriated land, and






(b)


the following if and to the extent they are directly attributable to the taking or result from the construction or use of the works for which the land is acquired:






(i)


the reduction in the market value of the remaining land;






(ii)


reasonable personal and business losses.






(2)


If a person claims business losses under subsection (1), the losses must not, unless the person and the expropriating authority otherwise agree, be determined until at least 6 months after the loss was sustained.






(3)


If part of the land is expropriated, the amount of compensation payable in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (1) (a) and (b) (i) may be established by determining the market value of the area of all of the land before the date of expropriation and subtracting from it the market value of the land remaining after the expropriation occurs, but in no case, subject to section 44, must compensation be less than the amount determined by multiplying the ratio of the area of the land taken to the area of all of the land before it was taken, times the value of the land before it was taken with the appropriate reduction if the interest expropriated is an easement, right of way or similar interest less than the fee simple interest.






(4)


For the purposes of the second calculation referred to in subsection (3), the value of the land before it was taken is the value of the land only, having no regard to improvements on the land.






(5)


If, in the case of a partial taking, the character and use, or potential use, of the land before it was taken varies such that the land that was taken was, before the taking, more valuable or less valuable than the average value of the land that was not taken, the court may, after making a determination under subsection (3), make an adjustment to reflect that value accordingly.






(6)


For the purposes of this section, expropriation of part of the land of an owner occurs only if






(a)


the owner retains land contiguous to the expropriated land, or






(b)


the owner owns land close to the land that was expropriated, the value of which was enhanced by unified ownership with the land expropriated.








Injurious affection if no land taken





41



(1)


In this section,

"injurious affection"

means injurious affection caused by an expropriating authority in respect of a work or project for which the expropriating authority had the power to expropriate land.






(2)


The repeal of the

Expropriation Act

, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 117, and the amendments and repeals in sections 56 to 128 of the

Expropriation Act

, S.B.C. 1987, c. 23, are deemed not to change the law respecting injurious affection if no land of an owner is expropriated, and an owner whose land is not taken or acquired is, despite those amendments or repeals, entitled to compensation to the same extent, if any, that the owner would have been entitled to had those enactments not been amended or repealed.






(3)


An owner referred to in subsection (2) who wishes to make a claim for compensation for injurious affection must make the claim by applying to the court, and the court must hear the claim and determine






(a)


whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, and






(b)


if entitled to compensation, the amount of the compensation.






(4)


Without limiting any other provision of this section, the BC Transportation Financing Authority has no greater liability to compensate an owner for injurious affection than does the minister responsible for the administration of the


Transportation Act


.








Limitation





42



(1)


A claim for compensation under section 41 (3) must be made in writing to the court by the person suffering the damage, with particulars of the claim, within one year after the damage






(a)


was sustained, or






(b)


became known to the person.






(2)


If a claim referred to in subsection (1) is not made in accordance with that subsection, the right to compensation is forever barred.








Substituted land





43



If an expropriating authority and an owner whose land is expropriated agree, the expropriating authority may grant to that owner, in complete or partial satisfaction of the owner's claim for compensation,






(a)


other land, or






(b)


an interest or estate in the expropriated land or other land.








Work or use benefiting claimant





44



(1)


If part of the land of an owner is expropriated, and the expropriation or the construction or use of works by the expropriating authority are of special benefit to that owner or to the owner's remaining land beyond any general benefit to any other owner benefited by the expropriation or the construction or use, there must be deducted from the amount of compensation payable to that owner the estimated value of the benefit.






(1.1)


If part of the land of an owner is expropriated, and the expropriation or the construction or use of the works for which the expropriated land was acquired are of any benefit to that owner, the estimated value of the benefit must be deducted from the amount of compensation otherwise payable to that owner, under section 40 (1) (b) (i), for the reduction in the market value of the remaining land, whether or not any other owner is benefited by the expropriation of the expropriated land or by the construction or use of the works.






(2)


If works are not constructed or used within a reasonable period of time, the owner may apply to the court for an appropriate adjustment of compensation.

(6)


On a claim under section 41 (3), the court may award, in its discretion, costs to the claimant or the expropriation authority.

the actual reasonable legal, appraisal and other costs, or






(b)


if the Lieutenant Governor in Council prescribes a tariff of costs, the amounts prescribed in the tariff and not the costs referred to in paragraph (a).






(8)

(9)


If the court determines the amount of compensation or damages to which a person is entitled, the amount of costs must be determined by a registrar of the court.

on any other amount, from

(4)


If the amount of the payment under section 20 (1) or (12) or otherwise is less than 90% of the compensation awarded, excluding interest and business loss, the court must order the expropriating authority to pay additional interest, at an annual rate of 5%, on the amount of the difference, calculated from the date that the payment is made to the date of the determination of compensation.
