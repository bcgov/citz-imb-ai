Direct action by government




2

(1)


The government has a direct and distinct action against a manufacturer
to recover the cost of health care benefits caused or contributed to
by a tobacco-related wrong.




(2)

An action under subsection (1) is brought by the government in its own
right and not on the basis of a subrogated claim.




(3)

In an action under subsection (1), the government may recover the cost
of health care benefits whether or not there has been any recovery by
other persons who have suffered damage caused or contributed to by the
tobacco-related wrong committed by the defendant.




(4)

In an action under subsection (1), the government may recover the cost
of health care benefits




(a)

for particular individual insured persons, or




(b)

on an aggregate basis, for a population of insured persons as a result
of exposure to a type of tobacco product.




(5)

If the government seeks in an action under subsection (1) to recover
the cost of health care benefits on an aggregate basis,




(a)

it is not necessary




(i)

to identify particular individual insured persons,




(ii)

to prove the cause of tobacco-related disease in any particular
individual insured person, or

to prove the cost of health care benefits for any particular
individual insured person,

a person is not compellable to answer questions with respect to the
health of, or the provision of health care benefits for, particular
individual insured persons,

documents referred to in paragraph (b) and the order must include
directions concerning the nature, level of detail and type of
information to be disclosed, and




(e)

if an order is made under paragraph (d), the identity of particular
individual insured persons must not be disclosed and all identifiers
that disclose or may be used to trace the names or identities of any
particular individual insured persons must be deleted from any
documents before the documents are disclosed.






Recovery of cost of health care benefits on aggregate basis




3

(1)


In an action under section 2 (1) for the recovery of the cost of
health care benefits on an aggregate basis, subsection (2) applies if
the government proves, on a balance of probabilities, that, in respect
of a type of tobacco product,




(a)

the defendant breached a common law, equitable or statutory duty or
obligation owed to persons in British Columbia who have been exposed
or might become exposed to the type of tobacco product,




(b)

exposure to the type of tobacco product can cause or contribute to
disease, and




(c)

during all or part of the period of the breach referred to in
paragraph (a), the type of tobacco product, manufactured or promoted
by the defendant, was offered for sale in British Columbia.




(2)

Subject to subsections (1) and (4), the court must presume that




(a)

the population of insured persons who were exposed to the type of
tobacco product, manufactured or promoted by the defendant, would not
have been exposed to the product but for the breach referred to in
subsection (1) (a), and




(b)

the exposure described in paragraph (a) caused or contributed to
disease or the risk of disease in a portion of the population
described in paragraph (a).




(3)

If the presumptions under subsection (2) (a) and (b) apply,




(a)

the court must determine on an aggregate basis the cost of health care
benefits provided after the date of the breach referred to in
subsection (1) (a) resulting from exposure to the type of tobacco
product, and




(b)

each defendant to which the presumptions apply is liable for the
proportion of the aggregate cost referred to in paragraph (a) equal to
its market share in the type of tobacco product.




(4)

The amount of a defendant's liability assessed under subsection (3)
(b) may be reduced, or the proportions of liability assessed under
subsection (3) (b) readjusted amongst the defendants, to the extent
that a defendant proves, on a balance of probabilities, that the
breach referred to in subsection (1) (a) did not cause or contribute
to the exposure referred to in subsection (2) (a) or to the disease or
risk of disease referred to in subsection (2) (b).






Joint and several liability in an action under section 2 (1)




4

(1)


Two or more defendants in an action under section 2 (1) are jointly
and severally liable for the cost of health care benefits if




(a)

those defendants jointly breached a duty or obligation described in
the definition of "tobacco-related wrong" in section 1 (1), and




(b)

as a consequence of the breach described in paragraph (a), at least
one of those defendants is held liable in the action under section 2
(1) for the cost of those health care benefits.




(2)

For purposes of an action under section 2 (1), 2 or more
manufacturers, whether or not they are defendants in the action, are
deemed to have jointly breached a duty or obligation described in the
definition of "tobacco-related wrong" in section 1 (1) if




(a)

one or more of those manufacturers are held to have breached the duty
or obligation, and




(b)

at common law, in equity or under an enactment those manufacturers
would be held




(i)

to have conspired or acted in concert with respect to the breach,




(ii)

to have acted in a principal and agent relationship with each other
with respect to the breach, or




(iii)

to be jointly or vicariously liable for the breach if damages would
have been awarded to a person who suffered as a consequence of the
breach.






Population based evidence to establish causation and quantify damages
or cost




5


Statistical information and information derived from epidemiological,
sociological and other relevant studies, including information derived
from sampling, is admissible as evidence for the purposes of
establishing causation and quantifying damages or the cost of health
care benefits respecting a tobacco-related wrong in an action brought




(a)

by or on behalf of a person in the person's own name or as a member of
a class of persons under the

Class Proceedings Act

, or

by the government under section 2 (1).

one or more defendants causes or contributes to a risk of disease by
exposing persons to a type of tobacco product, and




(b)

the plaintiff has been exposed to the type of tobacco product referred
to in paragraph (a) and suffers disease as a result of the exposure,


the court may find each defendant that caused or contributed to the

health care benefits incurred equal to the proportion of its

to the public;
