Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement







PREAMBLE



WHEREAS:



The Maa‑nulth First Nations assert that they have used, occupied and governed        their traditional territories from time immemorial;


The Maa‑nulth First Nations have never entered into a treaty or land claims
agreement with the Crown;


The

Constitution Act, 1982

recognizes and affirms the existing
aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada, and the courts have stated
that aboriginal rights include aboriginal title;


The Maa‑nulth First Nations assert that they have an inherent right to
self-government, and the Government of Canada has negotiated self-government in this
Agreement based on its policy that the inherent right to self-government is an existing
aboriginal right within section 35 of the

Constitution Act,
1982

;


The Maa‑nulth First Nations' existing aboriginal rights are recognized and
affirmed by the

Constitution Act, 1982

, and the Parties have negotiated
this Agreement in accordance with the British Columbia treaty process to provide certainty
in respect of those rights and to allow them to continue and to have effect and be exercised
as set out in this Agreement;


Canada and British Columbia acknowledge the perspective of the Maa‑nulth First
Nations that harm and losses in relation to their aboriginal rights have occurred in the
past and express regret if any actions or omissions of the Crown have contributed to that
perspective, and the Parties rely on this Agreement to move them beyond the difficult
circumstances of the past;


Canada and British Columbia acknowledge the aspirations of the Maa‑nulth First
Nations to preserve, promote and develop the culture, heritage, language and economies of
the Maa‑nulth First Nations;


Canada and British Columbia acknowledge the aspirations of the Maa‑nulth First
Nations and the Maa‑nulth‑aht to participate more fully in the economic, political, cultural
and social life of British Columbia in a way that preserves and enhances the collective
identity of the Maa‑nulth‑aht as the Maa‑nulth First Nations and to evolve and flourish as
self-sufficient and sustainable communities; and


The Parties are committed to the reconciliation of the prior presence of the
Maa‑nulth First Nations and the sovereignty of the Crown through the negotiation of this
Agreement which will establish new government-to-government relationships based on mutual
respect.


NOW THEREFORE THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

Nations, Maa‑nulth‑aht, Maa‑nulth First Nation Citizens, Maa‑nulth First Nation Public
Institutions, Maa‑nulth First Nation Corporations, Maa‑nulth First Nation Governments,

1.6.0  APPLICATION OF THE

INDIAN ACT





1.6.1

Subject to Chapter 15

Indian Act

Transition
and 19.5.0, the

Indian Act

has no application to any Maa‑nulth First
Nation, Maa‑nulth First Nation Government, Maa‑nulth First Nation Public Institution,
Maa‑nulth First Nation Corporation and Maa‑nulth‑aht as of the Effective Date, except for
the purpose of determining whether an individual is an "Indian".





1.7.0  INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS




1.7.1

After the Effective Date, before consenting to be bound by a
new International Treaty which would give rise to a new International Legal Obligation that
may adversely affect a right of a Maa‑nulth First Nation Government under this Agreement,
Canada will Consult with that Maa‑nulth First Nation Government in respect of the
International Treaty either separately or through a forum that Canada determines is
appropriate.



1.7.2

Where Canada informs a Maa‑nulth First Nation Government that
it considers that a Maa‑nulth First Nation Law or exercise of power of that Maa‑nulth First
Nation Government causes Canada to be unable to perform an International Legal Obligation,
that Maa‑nulth First Nation Government and Canada will discuss remedial measures to enable
Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation. Subject to 1.7.3, the Maa‑nulth First
Nation Government will remedy the law or other exercise of power to the extent necessary to
enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation.



1.7.3

Subject to 1.7.5, where Canada and a Maa‑nulth First Nation
Government disagree over whether a Maa‑nulth First Nation Law or other exercise of power of
that Maa‑nulth First Nation Government causes Canada to be unable to perform an
International Legal Obligation, the dispute will be resolved in accordance with the
provisions in Chapter 25 Dispute Resolution, and if the dispute goes to arbitration,
and:


a. if the arbitrator, having taken into account all relevant considerations,
including any reservations and exceptions taken by Canada, determines that the Maa‑nulth
First Nation Law or other exercise of power of the Maa‑nulth First Nation Government does
not cause Canada to be unable to perform the International Legal Obligation, or that the
remedial measures are sufficient to enable Canada to perform the International Legal
Obligation, Canada will not take any further action for this reason aimed at changing the
Maa‑nulth First Nation Law or other exercise of power; or


b. if the arbitrator, having taken into account all relevant considerations,
including any reservations and exceptions available to Canada, determines that the Maa‑nulth
First Nation Law or other exercise of power of that Maa‑nulth First Nation Government causes
Canada to be unable to perform the International Legal Obligation, or that the remedial
measures are insufficient to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation the
Maa‑nulth First Nation Government will remedy the law or other exercise of power to the
extent necessary to enable Canada to perform the International Legal
Obligation.



1.7.4

Canada will Consult the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation
Government in respect of the development of positions taken by Canada before an
International Tribunal where its Maa‑nulth First Nation Law or other exercise of power of
that Maa‑nulth First Nation Government has given rise to an issue concerning the performance
of an International Legal Obligation of Canada. Canada's positions before the International
Tribunal will take into account the commitment of the Parties to the integrity of this
Agreement.



1.7.5

If there is a finding of an International Tribunal of
non-performance of an International Legal Obligation of Canada attributable to a Maa‑nulth
First Nation Law or other exercise of power of a Maa‑nulth First Nation Government, that
Maa‑nulth First Nation Government will, at the request of Canada, remedy the law or other
exercise of power to enable Canada to perform the International Legal Obligation, unless the
law or action is in accordance with this Agreement and equivalent to a relevant Federal Law
or Provincial Law, as applicable, consistent with the compliance with Canada or British
Columbia in respect of that International Legal Obligation.





1.8.0  RELATIONSHIP OF LAWS




1.8.1

This Agreement prevails to the extent of an inconsistency or a
Conflict with Federal Law or Provincial Law.



1.8.2

Federal Settlement Legislation prevails over other Federal Law
to the extent of a Conflict and Provincial Settlement Legislation prevails over other
Provincial Law to the extent of a Conflict.



1.8.3

Any licence, permit or other authorization to be issued by
Canada or British Columbia as a result of this Agreement will be issued under Federal Law or
Provincial Law, as the case may be, and will not be part of this Agreement.



1.8.4

This Agreement prevails to the extent of an inconsistency or
Conflict with any provision of a licence, permit or other authorization issued by Canada or
British Columbia as a result of this Agreement.



1.8.5

Notwithstanding any other rule of priority in this Agreement,
Federal Law or Provincial Law prevails to the extent of a Conflict with Maa‑nulth First
Nation Law that has an incidental impact on any federal or provincial legislative
jurisdiction for which a Maa‑nulth First Nation Government:


a. does not have any law-making authority; or


b. does have law-making authority but in respect of which Federal Law or
Provincial Law prevails in the event of a Conflict.



1.8.6

Notwithstanding any other rule of priority in this Agreement,
Federal Law or Provincial Law prevails to the extent of a Conflict with Maa‑nulth First
Nation Law that has a double aspect with any federal or provincial legislative jurisdiction
for which a Maa‑nulth First Nation Government:


a. does not have any law-making authority; or


b. does have law-making authority but in respect of which Federal Law or
Provincial Law prevails in the event of a Conflict.



1.8.7

Notwithstanding any other rule of priority in this Agreement,
Federal Law in relation to peace, order and good government, criminal law, human rights, the
protection of the health and safety of all Canadians, or other matters of overriding
national importance, prevails to the extent of a Conflict with Maa‑nulth First Nation
Law.



1.8.8

2.10.15

If British Columbia and Ka:'yu:'k't'h'/Che:k'tles7et'h'
First Nations are unable to reach agreement on the fair market value of the lands identified

Lands




2.10.17

If, at any time, British Columbia determines that a parcel
of provincial Crown land, or any portion thereof, described as "Subject Lands" in Appendix

otherwise agrees in writing.



2.10.29

A Maa‑nulth First Nation will own the Subsurface Resources

the date of such expropriation, request that British Columbia consent to the proposed
replacement lands which that Maa‑nulth First Nation intends to acquire being added to its
Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands.



2.11.22

If a Maa‑nulth First Nation intends to acquire lands and

except to the extent that such use or occupation interferes with the use of land for which
the expropriation took place.





2.12.0  FEDERAL EXPROPRIATION OF MAA‑NULTH FIRST NATION
LANDS




2.12.1

Canada and the Maa‑nulth First Nations acknowledge that as a
general principle, and where reasonable and practical, Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands are not
subject to expropriation, except as described in this Chapter, due to the Maa‑nulth First
Nations' interest in maintaining the size and integrity of Maa‑nulth First Nation
Lands.



2.12.2

Notwithstanding 2.12.1, any Interest in Maa‑nulth First
Nation Lands may be expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority in accordance with
federal legislation and with the consent of the Governor-in-Council.



2.12.3

The Governor-in-Council may consent to an expropriation of an
Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands only if the expropriation is justifiable and
necessary for a public purpose.



2.12.4

For the purposes of 2.12.3, an expropriation is justifiable
where the Governor-in-Council is satisfied that the following requirements have been
met:


a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative land to acquire that is not
Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands;


b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Federal Expropriating Authority to
acquire the Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands through agreement with the applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation;


c. the most limited Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands necessary for the
purpose for which the Interest in land is sought is to be expropriated; and


d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that would be
protected from disclosure under federal legislation, has been provided to the applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation.



2.12.5

Before the Governor-in-Council issues an order consenting to
the expropriation of an Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands, the Federal Expropriating
Authority will provide to the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation, and make available to the
public, a report stating the justification for the expropriation and describing the steps
taken to satisfy the requirements of 2.12.4.



2.12.6

If a Maa‑nulth First Nation objects to a proposed
expropriation of an Interest in its Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands, it may, within 60 days
after the report has been provided to that Maa‑nulth First Nation in accordance with 2.12.5,
while at the same time providing notice in writing to the Federal Expropriating Authority,
refer the matter to a neutral evaluator, in accordance with Appendix Y-5, for a review of
the steps taken to satisfy the requirements described in 2.12.4.



2.12.7

The Federal Expropriating Authority may not seek
Governor-in-Council consent to the expropriation of an Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation
Lands before the expiration of the period referred to in 2.12.6 or, if the applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation has referred the matter to a neutral evaluator in accordance with
2.12.6, before the neutral evaluator has delivered an opinion on the matter, such opinion to
be rendered within 60 days of the referral being made or within such additional time as the
Federal Expropriating Authority and that Maa‑nulth First Nation may agree.



2.12.8

For greater certainty, the opinion of the neutral evaluator
contemplated by 2.12.7:


a. is without prejudice to the legal positions that may be taken by a Federal
Expropriating Authority and the Maa‑nulth First Nation in court or in any other
forum;


b. is not admissible in any legal proceedings, unless otherwise required by law;
and


c. is not binding on the Governor-in-Council under 2.12.3 and
2.12.4.



2.12.9

Where an estate in fee simple in a parcel of Maa‑nulth First
Nation Lands is expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority, the Federal Expropriating
Authority will make reasonable efforts to identify replacement lands within the Maa‑nulth
First Nation Area of the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation, being either federal Crown land
or land available on a willing-seller willing-buyer basis, of equivalent or greater size and
comparable value and, if acceptable to that Maa‑nulth First Nation, to acquire and offer the
replacement lands to that Maa‑nulth First Nation as partial or full compensation for the
expropriation. If the Federal Expropriating Authority and that Maa‑nulth First Nation are
unable to agree on the provision of replacement lands as compensation, the Federal
Expropriating Authority will provide that Maa‑nulth First Nation with other compensation in
accordance with this Agreement.



2.12.10

Subject to 2.12.13, if the replacement lands identified by
the Federal Expropriating Authority would result in the total size of the applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation's Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands being less than at the Effective Date
and that Maa‑nulth First Nation does not agree that the replacement lands are of comparable
value to the Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands being expropriated, that Maa‑nulth
First Nation may refer the issue of whether the replacement lands are of comparable value to
the Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands being expropriated to be finally determined by
arbitration in accordance with Chapter 25 Dispute Resolution.



2.12.11

The total value of compensation for an Interest in Maa‑nulth
First Nation Lands expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority in accordance with this
Chapter will be determined by taking into account the following factors:


a. the fair market value of the expropriated Interest or of the Maa‑nulth First
Nation Lands in which an interest has been expropriated;


b. the replacement value of any improvement to the Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands
in which an Interest has been expropriated;


c. any expenses or losses resulting from the disturbance directly attributable to
the expropriation;


d. any reduction in the value of any Interest in Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands
that is not expropriated which directly relates to the expropriation;


e. any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of Maa‑nulth First
Nation Lands in which an Interest has been expropriated to the applicable Maa‑nulth First
Nation, provided that the cultural or other special value is only applied to an Interest in
Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands recognized in law and held by that Maa‑nulth First Nation, and
provided that there will be no increase in the total value of compensation on account of any
Aboriginal rights, title or interest; and


f. the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or incidental to
the occupation or use of Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands to the extent that the value is not
otherwise compensated.



2.12.12

Subject to 2.12.13, if the total value of compensation
cannot be agreed upon between the Federal Expropriating Authority and the Maa‑nulth First
Nation, or where there is Disagreement on whether the combination of replacement lands and
cash is equal to the total value of compensation, either Canada acting on behalf of the
Federal Expropriating Authority or that Maa‑nulth First Nation may refer the issue of the
total value of compensation for dispute resolution in accordance with Chapter 25 Dispute
Resolution.



2.12.13

A dispute on the valuation of replacement lands under
2.12.10, or on the total value of compensation under 2.12.12, or on the terms and conditions
of the return of land under 2.12.27, will not delay the expropriation.



2.12.14

Any claim or encumbrance in respect of the Interest
expropriated may only be made or discharged against the amount of compensation payable in
accordance with Federal Law.



2.12.15

Interest on compensation is payable from the date the
expropriation takes effect, at the prejudgment interest rate payable in accordance with
federal legislation.



2.12.16

Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates an
estate in fee simple in a parcel of Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands, that parcel is no longer
Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands.



2.12.17

Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates less
than an estate in fee simple in a parcel of Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands:


a. the parcel of land retains its status as Maa‑nulth First Nation
Lands;


b. the parcel of land remains subject to Maa‑nulth First Nation Law that are
otherwise applicable, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with the use of
the parcel of land for which the expropriation took place; and


c. the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation may continue to use and occupy the
parcel of land, except to the extent the use or occupation is inconsistent with the
expropriation in the view of the Federal Expropriating Authority.



2.12.18

A Maa‑nulth First Nation may request that Canada and British
Columbia consent to a parcel of replacement lands transferred to that Maa‑nulth First Nation
in accordance with 2.12.0 being added to its Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands.



2.12.19

Canada will consent to replacement lands transferred by a
Federal Expropriating Authority to the applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation as part of the
compensation in accordance with 2.12.9 being added to Maa‑nulth First Nation Lands
if:


a. the replacement lands are located within the Maa‑nulth First Nation Area of
that Maa‑nulth First Nation;


b. the replacement lands are located in an area free from overlap with another
First Nation or, if within an area of overlap with another First Nation, that First Nation
provides written consent; and


c. Canada will not be required to assume financial or other obligations
associated with the replacement lands.

Joint Fisheries Committee referred to in 10.1.22 the Minister will provide written reasons
for any reduction in the Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation.





Unallocated Species




10.1.24

Where a Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for a species of Fish or
Aquatic Plant is not established under this Agreement, that species of Fish or Aquatic Plant
may be harvested under a Maa‑nulth First Nation Fishing Right in accordance with a Maa‑nulth
Harvest Document.



10.1.25

Where a Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for a species of Fish or
Aquatic Plant has not been established under this Agreement, Canada, British Columbia or the
Maa‑nulth First Nations may propose the establishment of a Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for
that species by providing the other Parties with a written proposal and providing a copy of
the proposal to the Joint Fisheries Committee.



10.1.26

Following receipt of a proposal made in accordance with
10.1.25, the Joint Fisheries Committee will consider the proposal and, where all of the
members agree, provide a recommendation to the Parties in respect of a basic harvest
entitlement for the species and a Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for the species, taking into
account:


a. base period information on harvesting by Maa‑nulth First Nations of that
species for Domestic Purposes;


b. harvesting by other aboriginal groups of that species for Domestic
Purposes;


c. measures necessary for conservation;


d. harvesting of the species required for:


i. the management of that species; and


ii. enhancement of that species;


e. the impact of harvesting by others on a Maa‑nulth First Nation Fishing Right;
and

accordance with 10.1.25, all of the members of the Joint Fisheries Committee have not agreed
on a recommendation, the Joint Fisheries Committee will notify the Parties that they are
unable to agree on a recommendation.



10.1.28

Following receipt of a recommendation contemplated by 10.1.26
or the notice contemplated by 10.1.27, the Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach
agreement on a Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for the species taking into account the
recommendations, if any, provided by the Joint Fisheries Committee and any other relevant
information.



10.1.29

Where the Parties agree on a Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for
the species, the Parties will confirm their agreement in writing and Schedule 6 and 10.1.19
are deemed to be amended upon completion of the written confirmation.



10.1.30

For the purposes of 10.1.26, 10.1.33 and 10.1.34, the basic
harvest entitlement for a species of Fish or Aquatic Plant is the average annual harvest by
the Maa‑nulth First Nations of that species for Domestic Purposes over the base period for
that species.



10.1.31

For the purposes of 10.1.26 and 10.1.30, a base period is a
period of ten calendar years immediately preceding the date of the proposal made in
accordance with 10.1.25 or such other period agreed to by the Parties.

Where all members of the Joint Fisheries Committee agree, the
Joint Fisheries Committee may recommend to the Parties that studies, in respect of the
matters described in 10.1.26, be conducted to assist the members in reaching agreement on a
recommendation. Where the Parties agree with the recommendation of the Joint Fisheries
Committee for studies, the Parties may agree to extend the time period contemplated by
10.1.27 or 10.1.33.



10.1.33

If the Parties are unable to reach agreement on a Maa‑nulth
Fish Allocation for the species within one year of a proposal being made in accordance with
10.1.25 or a shorter time period if the Parties agree, the basic harvest entitlement for the
species will be finally determined by arbitration in accordance with Chapter 25 Dispute
Resolution without having to proceed through Stages One and Two. The arbitrator will
determine the Maa‑nulth First Nations basic harvest entitlement for the species of Fish or
Aquatic Plant within a period of not more than one year and then the arbitrator will provide
a decision to the Parties.



10.1.34

In an arbitration referred to in 10.1.33, Canada,
British Columbia or the Maa‑nulth First Nations may request an arbitrator to describe a
basic harvest entitlement for a species as a share of an abundance of the
species.



10.1.35

In an arbitration referred to in 10.1.33, the arbitrator will
take into account the matters described in 10.1.26.



10.1.36

Once the arbitrator provides the decision to the Parties as
contemplated by 10.1.33, the Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement on the
Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for the species, taking into account the decision of the
arbitrator.



10.1.37

If the Parties agree on a Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for the
species in accordance with 10.1.36, the Parties will confirm their agreement and Schedule 6
and 10.1.19 are deemed to be amended on the date the last Party provides its
confirmation.



10.1.38

If, six months after the arbitrator provides a decision to
the Parties as contemplated by 10.1.33, the Parties are unable to reach agreement on the
Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for the species, the Maa‑nulth Fish Allocation for the species is
125% of the basic harvest entitlement determined by the arbitrator in accordance with
10.1.33.

NOTES FOR FINALIZING THE CAPITAL TRANSFER PAYMENT PLANS



These notes do not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these notes is to
enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the amounts to be shown in the final
version of this Schedule. Interest at a rate of 4.545% per annum beginning on Effective Date
and compounded annually was used to establish the provisional payment amounts in each

accordance with 28.2.1.



"Transition Date"

means the date 15 months after the Signing
Date.


2. If the period between the Signing Date and the Effective Date is less than 15
months, on the Revision Date each provisional payment amount in the Capital Transfer Payment
Plans is adjusted as follows:


provisional payment amount * M/L


where,


"/" means divided by;


"*" means multiplied by;

Capital Transfer is adjusted by FDDIPI to the period that ends on the date that is 15 months
after the Signing Date, and to lengthen the period of which the Capital Transfer is adjusted
by the calculation rate to the period between the date that is 15 months after the Signing
Date and the Effective Date.

and setting out the amounts of all the loans from Canada to the Maa‑nulth First Nations, all
interest accrued to date, and the relevant terms and conditions of those
loans.


2. On the Revision Date, the provisional negotiation loan repayment amounts in
the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plans are adjusted to final negotiation loan repayment
amounts by:


a) determining the amount of the additional negotiation loans made by Canada to
each Maa‑nulth First Nation which were not included in the calculation of the provisional
negotiation loan repayment amounts and any applicable additional interest accrued since the
provisional negotiation loan and interest amounts were calculated; and


b) prorating and adjusting the additional amounts determined in accordance with
paragraph 2a) for that Maa‑nulth First Nation over the applicable Negotiation Loan Repayment
Plan such that the amounts in the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plans are proportional to
the amounts in the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan and such that each final
Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan incorporates interest on unpaid loan balances at 4.545% per
annum beginning on the Effective Date and compounded annually which is the same rate of
interest used to establish the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan.


3. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in accordance with
paragraph 2, the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plans are amended to incorporate the adjusted
figures and the headings in each Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan are replaced by the
following headings:

b. will have little detrimental impact on public access on the trails;
and


c. will have little detrimental impact on the ecological integrity of the Park
and the Lands.

Trees under Sections 9 and 10 of this Agreement, and will indemnify Canada against any
liabilities or costs caused by or resulting from such cutting or use.


10. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, Huu‑ay‑aht will continue
to exercise all the rights, privileges and interests, including all traditional and cultural
uses as determined by Huu‑ay‑aht, in respect of the Lands.



Termination



11. The rights and interests of Huu‑ay‑aht surrendered will revert to Huu‑ay‑aht
and its members, and any rights or interests granted pursuant to or ancillary to this

national park reserve.

However, as there may still be some Works that were missed in the identification process the
parties agree that for such Works the Grantor grants to Hydro for so long as required, a
right of way over those portions of the Lands upon which such Works are located on the
following terms:


(a) for such Works, Hydro holds the same rights, privileges and obligations as
apply to Hydro for the use of the Right of Way Area and the Area of the Works under this

materially affect or interfere with the exercise of Hydro's rights under this
Agreement.



5.0  Protection of the Environment



5.1 Hydro will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement having regard
for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent measures to minimize the danger or
disruption to the Environment.

accordance with Section 8.1 on or about the Right of Way Area, Hydro will cause that portion
of the Lands used by Hydro for the Works as contemplated in Section 2.1(a) to be surveyed by
a British Columbia Land Surveyor and will deliver such survey plan to the Grantor. Upon the
delivery of such survey plan to the Grantor, that portion of the Lands so surveyed will be
deemed to be the Right of Way Area for purposes of interpreting this Agreement and as
modified under this Agreement from time to time. The Grantor authorizes Hydro and the
registrar of the relevant land title office to do all things necessary in relation to the
filing of the survey plan for the Right of Way Area, including inserting the number assigned
by the relevant land title office to such plan;


(b) Hydro shall pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies, charges
and assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account of Hydro which
relate to the Works and which Hydro is liable to pay;

in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Lands by Hydro, and on written notice from the Grantor, to make safe,
clean, and sanitary any portion of them that contravene the provisions of this covenant,
provided that Hydro has no obligation to keep any portion of the Lands suitable for use by
anyone except Hydro;


(d) Hydro shall bury and maintain all underground works as may be required so as
not to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;

of any archaeological material discovered by Hydro on the Right of Way Area, and to
immediately notify the Grantor;


(f) Hydro shall not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in
excavations or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as
backfilling proceeds;


(g) Hydro shall not commit or suffer any wilful or voluntary waste, spoil or
destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon anything that may
be or become a nuisance or annoyance to the Grantor, except to the extent required by Hydro
acting reasonably, to exercise its rights under this Agreement; and


(h) Hydro shall permit the Grantor to enter upon the Right of Way Area at any
time to examine its condition.



7.0  Work Plans



7.1 Except in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended emergency, Hydro
will provide to the Grantor a written work plan describing the proposed work located on,
outside or related to the Right of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work
under this Agreement:


(a) construction of any new Works;


(b) relocation of any Works; and


(c) construction or relocation of any Access Improvements.


In accordance with this Section, prior to undertaking any work, Hydro will
deliver a copy of the work plan to the Grantor for comment by the Grantor. The Grantor will
no more than fourteen (14) days after receiving the work plan, provide to Hydro in writing
any comments that it may have, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to accommodate any
suggestions or requests presented by the Grantor to Hydro provided they do not result in
delays, increased costs or technical difficulties.



8.0  Relocation of Works due to change



8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for any
reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way Area or the Excluded Right
of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works, then the Grantor will consent to the relocation
and replacement of such Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:


(a) Hydro will before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the Grantor
indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for approval by the Grantor, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable
conditions;


(b) Hydro will take into account any likely material effect of the relocated
Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into account the cost efficiencies of the
location selected by Hydro for the relocated Works in relation to alternative
locations;


(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and


(d) if Works are relocated from the Excluded Right of Way Area to the Lands Hydro
will pay the Grantor the fair market value of the new Right of Way Area provided the Grantor
has not caused any portion of such Excluded Right of Way Area to become unsuitable for any
of the Works.



9.0  Relocation of Works at the request of the Grantor



9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right of Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Hydro will relocate any Works in the
Right of Way Area to a new location on the Lands, provided that:


(a) the new location is, in the reasonable opinion of Hydro, suitable for use for
the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance and operation, and cost
factors;


(b) the Grantor gives Hydro reasonable notice to permit proper design, planning
and construction of the Works to be relocated;


(c) the Grantor agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses, including costs
of design, supervision and construction (before any relocation, the Grantor will pay the
costs and expenses as estimated by Hydro, with appropriate adjustments based on actuals

or permittees, that Hydro will:


(a) compensate the Grantor for such damages, to the extent caused by Hydro;

all the existing Works and related Right of Way Area as of the date of this Agreement.
However, as there may still be some Works that were missed in the identification process the
parties agree that for such Works the Grantor grants to Hydro for so long as required, a
right of way over those portions of the Lands upon which such Works are located on the
following terms:


(a) for such Works, Hydro holds the same rights, privileges and obligations as

materially affect or interfere with the exercise of Hydro's rights under this
Agreement.



5.0  Protection of the Environment



5.1 Hydro will undertake activities permitted under this Agreement having regard
for the impact on the Environment, and will take prudent measures to minimize the danger or
disruption to the Environment.



6.0  Covenants of Hydro



6.1 Hydro covenants separately with the Grantor that:


(a) After the construction of the Works or any relocation of the Works in
accordance with Section 8.1 on or about the Right of Way Area, Hydro will cause that portion
of the Lands used by Hydro for the Works as contemplated in Section 2.1(a) to be surveyed by
a British Columbia Land Surveyor and will deliver such survey plan to the Grantor. Upon the
delivery of such survey plan to the Grantor, that portion of the Lands so surveyed will be
deemed to be the Right of Way Area for purposes of interpreting this Agreement and as
modified under this Agreement from time to time. The Grantor authorizes Hydro and the
registrar of the relevant land title office to do all things necessary in relation to the
filing of the survey plan for the Right of Way Area, including inserting the number assigned
by the relevant land title office to such plan;


(b) Hydro shall pay and discharge when due all applicable taxes, levies, charges
and assessments now or hereafter assessed, levied or charged to the account of Hydro which
relate to the Works and which Hydro is liable to pay;


(c) Hydro shall keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro under this Agreement
in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the condition relates to the use or
occupation of the Lands by Hydro, and on written notice from the Grantor, to make safe,
clean, and sanitary any portion of them that contravene the provisions of this covenant,
provided that Hydro has no obligation to keep any portion of the Lands suitable for use by
anyone except Hydro;


(d) Hydro shall bury and maintain all underground works as may be required so as
not to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;

(f) Hydro shall not bury debris or rubbish of any kind on the Lands in
excavations or backfill, and to remove shoring and similar temporary structures as
backfilling proceeds;


(g) Hydro shall not commit or suffer any wilful or voluntary waste, spoil or
destruction on the Right of Way Area, or do or suffer to be done thereon anything that may
be or become a nuisance or annoyance to the Grantor, except to the extent required by Hydro
acting reasonably, to exercise its rights under this Agreement; and


(h) Hydro shall permit the Grantor to enter upon the Right of Way Area at any
time to examine its condition.



7.0  Work Plans



7.1 Except in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended emergency, Hydro
will provide to the Grantor a written work plan describing the proposed work located on,
outside or related to the Right of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work
under this Agreement:


(a) construction of any new Works;


(b) relocation of any Works; and


(c) construction or relocation of any Access Improvements.


In accordance with this Section, prior to undertaking any work, Hydro will
deliver a copy of the work plan to the Grantor for comment by the Grantor. The Grantor will
no more than fourteen (14) days after receiving the work plan, provide to Hydro in writing
any comments that it may have, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to accommodate any
suggestions or requests presented by the Grantor to Hydro provided they do not result in
delays, increased costs or technical difficulties.



8.0  Relocation of Works due to change



8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for any
reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way Area or the Excluded Right
of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works, then the Grantor will consent to the relocation
and replacement of such Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:


(a) Hydro will before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the Grantor
indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for approval by the Grantor, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or made subject to any unreasonable
conditions;


(b) Hydro will take into account any likely material effect of the relocated
Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into account the cost efficiencies of the
location selected by Hydro for the relocated Works in relation to alternative
locations;


(c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and


(d) if Works are relocated from the Excluded Right of Way Area to the Lands Hydro
will pay the Grantor the fair market value of the new Right of Way Area provided the Grantor
has not caused any portion of such Excluded Right of Way Area to become unsuitable for any
of the Works.



9.0  Relocation of Works at the request of the Grantor



9.1 If the Grantor requires a portion of the Right of Way Area for other
purposes, then upon written request by the Grantor, Hydro will relocate any Works in the

the relocated Works considering construction, maintenance and operation, and cost
factors;


(b) the Grantor gives Hydro reasonable notice to permit proper design, planning
and construction of the Works to be relocated;

(b) remove any Access Improvements no longer required in relation to such Right
of Way Area;


(c) remove all above ground Works from such Right of Way Area within a reasonable
period of time and any Works remaining on that portion of the Right of Way Area will be

reimburse the Grantor for all reasonable costs of removal; and


(d) remain liable for any environmental damage to the Lands arising from any
below ground Works that remain on or in such Right of Way Area, except if the Grantor uses
or authorizes the use of any of the remaining below ground Works for any purpose then Hydro
will not be liable for any environmental damage caused by the Grantor's use, or authorized
use; and to the extent necessary, this covenant will survive the termination of this
Agreement.

Works including the construction, maintenance, operation or decommissioning of its Works,
but only to the extent any such matter is found to be the responsibility of Hydro and was
not contributed to by the negligence, or breach, violation or non-performance, by the
Grantor or by those for whom the Grantor is responsible at law, and not for any matters
based on nuisance or the rule in

1. Upland Owner Consent








UPLAND OWNER CONSENT



TO: Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia, as
represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Lands ("British Columbia")


FROM: [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation]
("____________________")


WHEREAS:


A. [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] is the owner in fee simple of the land
located __________, legally described as [INSERT LEGAL DESCRIPTION] (the
"Upland");


B. British Columbia is the owner in fee simple of the parcel or tract of land
being the foreshore fronting on the Upland and all land covered by water adjoining the
Upland (the "Foreshore");


C. The Upland and Foreshore are adjacent to each other and the [Applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation], as owner of the Upland, is entitled to exercise its riparian right
of access to the Upland by crossing the Foreshore;


D. British Columbia wishes to interfere with the [Applicable Maa‑nulth First
Nation's] riparian right of access to the Upland by authorizing, under _______________
existing license(s) of occupation (collectively, the "Licenses"), the use of the identified
portions of the Foreshore for the following purposes:


(i) log booming and storage operation on the portion of the Foreshore shown
outlined in heavy bold on the attached Schedule "A" ("Log Booming Area") pursuant to a
license dated _____________ and numbered _______________, which has a term expiring
_________________; and


(ii) floating sport fishing resort business on the portion of the Foreshore shown
outlined in heavy bold on the attached Schedule "B" ("Resort Fishing Area") pursuant to a
license dated _____________ and numbered _______________, which has a term expiring
_____________________; and


[Note to Draft: These purposes will need to be amended to reflect the terms of
the actual foreshore tenures]


E. [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] is prepared to consent to such
interference pursuant to the provisions set out below:


NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of ONE
($1.00) dollar and other good and valuable consideration, now paid by British Columbia to
the

[Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] (the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:


1. The [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation], as owner of the Upland, on the terms
set forth herein, hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its
servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees and all those
claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the Licenses, with the [Applicable
Maa‑nulth First Nation] right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and repass over the Log
Booming Area and the Resort Fishing Area to gain access to and from the
Upland.


2. The [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] acknowledges and agrees that the
consent hereby given entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents,
contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming through them, in
accordance with the Licenses, to:


(a) construct, erect, place, install, moor, maintain, replace, renovate and
repair buildings, structures, works, improvements and chattels on all or any part of the Log
Booming Area or the Resort Fishing Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with
the purposes authorized and approved in the respective Licences;


(b) do all other acts within the Log Booming Area or the Resort Fishing Area,
reasonably necessary or incidental to the purposes authorized and approved in connection
with the respective Licenses.


3. The [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] or any of its successors or assigns,
as the case may be, will give written notice of this Consent to any person to whom it
proposes to dispose of any portion of the Upland which borders on the Foreshore, which
notice will be received by that person prior to such disposition. Prior to or concurrently
with such disposition, the [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] or any of its successors or
assigns, as the case may be, will obtain a written ratification of this Consent by the
transferee of such portion of the Upland in the same form as this Consent and will deliver
an originally executed copy thereof to British Columbia. For the purposes of this paragraph,
the word "dispose" means any transfer by any method to any person entitled to exercise a
riparian right of access to the Upland.


4. British Columbia covenants and agrees with the [Applicable Maa‑nulth First
Nation's] that nothing in this Consent will be deemed or otherwise construed so as to permit
British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees
and all those claiming through them to enter onto the Upland or to construct, place, erect
or install any buildings, structures, improvements or works thereon.


5. This Consent is effective from and after __________________, 200__ ("Effective
Date") until:


(a) ____________________, or the earlier termination of License No.
______________ in respect of the interference over the Log Booming Area; and


(b) ____________________, or the earlier termination of License No.
______________ in respect of the interference over the Resort Fishing Area.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, [Applicable Maa‑nulth First Nation] and British Columbia
have duly executed this Consent as of the Effective Date.

approval will not waive or render unnecessary the requirement to obtain consent or approval

Tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an Arbitral Award
unless:
