Non-arm's length investment prohibited




14

it is no longer prohibited under those sections.




(2)

If the administrator is satisfied that noncompliance with a provision
of sections 12 to 15 by the venture capital corporation occurred even
though its officers and directors exercised the degree of care,
diligence and skill to ensure compliance with sections 12 to 15 that a
reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable
circumstances, the administrator may, with or without conditions the
administrator may require in any particular case, relieve the venture
capital corporation for a period the administrator considers
appropriate from the consequences of the noncompliance.

relieve a venture capital corporation from the requirement under
subsection (1) to dispose of the investment to which subsection (1)

not imminent at the time the venture capital corporation made the
investment, and
