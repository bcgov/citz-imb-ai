Publication of name of publisher





12



(1)


The proprietor or publisher of a newspaper or other periodical publication is not entitled to the benefit of section 5, 6, 7, 8 or 11 unless the name of the proprietor or publisher and the address of publication are stated either at the head of the editorials or on the front page of the newspaper.

If a person, by letter containing the person's address, sent by registered mail and addressed to a broadcasting station, alleges that libel against the person has been broadcast from the station and requests the name and address of the owner or operator of the station or the names and addresses of the owner and the operator of the station, section 5, 6, 7, 8 or 11 do not apply with respect to an action by that person against the owner or operator for the alleged libel unless the person whose name and address are requested delivers the requested information to the first person, or sends it by registered mail addressed to that person, within 10 days from the date on which the letter is received at the broadcasting station.








Allegations in libel and slander actions





13



(1)


In actions of libel and slander the plaintiff may allege that the words or matter complained of were used in a defamatory sense, specifying the defamatory sense without any prefatory allegation to show how the words or matter were used in that sense.






(2)


The allegation is put in issue by the denial of the alleged libel or slander, and if the words or matter set out in the pleadings, with or without the alleged meaning, show a cause of action, the notice of civil claim is sufficient.








Direction to jury and return of verdict





14



(1)


On the trial of an action for making or publishing a libel, on the plea of not guilty pleaded, the jury sworn to try the issue may give a general verdict of guilty or not guilty on the whole matter put in issue in the action.






(2)


The jury must not be required or directed by the court before which the action is tried to find the defendant guilty merely on the proof of publication by the defendant of the paper charged to be a libel, and of the sense ascribed to it in the action.






(3)


The court before which the trial is held must, in its discretion, give the opinion and directions of the court to the jury on the matter in issue, as in other cases.






(4)


The jury may on the issue find a special verdict, if they think fit to do so.






(5)


The defendant, if found guilty, may move for a stay of judgment on the grounds and in a manner the defendant might have done before the coming into force of this Act.








Consolidation of actions





15



(1)


The Supreme Court, on an application by or on behalf of 2 or more defendants in actions in respect of the same, or substantially the same, libel or defamation brought by the same person, may make an order for the consolidation of the actions, so that they are tried together.






(2)


After the order has been made, and before the trial of the actions, the defendants in any new actions instituted in respect of the same, or substantially the same, libel or defamation are also entitled to be joined in a common action, on a joint application being made by the new defendants and the defendants in the actions already consolidated.








Verdict, damages and costs in consolidated actions





16



(1)


In a consolidated action under section 15, the court or jury must assess the whole amount of the damages, if any, in one sum, but a separate verdict must be taken for or against each defendant, in the same way as if the actions consolidated had been tried separately.






(2)


If the court or jury finds a verdict against the defendant or defendants in more than one of the actions consolidated, they must proceed to apportion the amount of damages that they have found between and against the defendants.






(3)


If the court awards costs to the plaintiff, the court must make an order it thinks just for the apportionment of costs between and against the defendants.








Obscene matter need not be set out in pleadings





17



(1)


It is not necessary in an action for libel to set out in the pleading or process obscene passages, but it is sufficient to deposit in the proper registry the book, newspaper or other document containing the alleged libel, together with particulars showing precisely by reference to pages, columns and lines where the alleged libel is to be found.






(2)


The particulars form part of the record, and all proceedings may be taken on them as though the passages complained of had been set out in pleading or process.








Where action must be tried





18



(1)


An action for libel contained in a public newspaper or other periodical publication when the chief office of the newspaper or other periodical publication is in British Columbia must be tried in the county where the chief office of the newspaper or periodical is, or in the county where the plaintiff resides at the time the action is brought.






(2)


On the application of either party the court may direct the issues to be tried or the damages to be assessed in another county if it appears to be in the interests of justice, or that it will promote a fair trial, and may impose terms as to payment of witness fees and otherwise as seem proper.








Security for costs





19



(1)


In an action brought for libel in a public newspaper or periodical publication the defendant may, at any time after the filing of the notice of civil claim, apply to the court for security for costs, on notice and an affidavit by the defendant or an agent, showing the following:






(a)


the nature of the action;






(b)


the defence;






(c)


that the plaintiff is not possessed of property sufficient to answer the costs of the action in case a verdict or judgment is given in favour of the defendant;






(d)


that the defendant has a good defence on the merits;






(e)


that the statements complained of were published in good faith;






(f)


that the grounds of action are trivial or frivolous.






(2)


The court may order that the plaintiff give security for the costs to be incurred in the action.






(3)


The security ordered must be given in accordance with the practice in cases where the plaintiff resides out of British Columbia.






(4)


The order is a stay of proceedings until the proper security is given.






(5)


If the alleged libel involves a criminal charge, the defendant is not entitled to security for costs under this Act unless the defendant satisfies the court that the action is trivial or frivolous or that the circumstances which, under sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 entitle the defendant at the trial to have the damages restricted to actual damages appear to exist, except the circumstance that the article complained of involves a criminal charge.






(6)


For the purposes of this section, the plaintiff or the defendant or their agents, may be examined on oath at any time after the notice of civil claim has been filed.








Application of sections 17 to 19 to broadcast libel





20



Sections 17, 18 and 19 apply, with the necessary modifications, to an action for libel in a broadcast.
