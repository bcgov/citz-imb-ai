Definitions





1



In this Act,

"Lieutenant Governor"

and

"Lieutenant Governor in Council"

, when referring to other provinces than British Columbia, have the same meaning as in the


Interpretation Act


(Canada).








Application of this Act





2



This Act applies to all proceedings and other matters for which the Legislature has jurisdiction.








Competency unaffected by interest or crime





3



A person is not incompetent to give evidence only because of interest or crime.








Privilege





4



(1)


In this section,

"witness"

includes any person who testifies in the course of any proceedings authorized by law.






(2)


A witness must not be excused from answering a question or producing a document on the ground that the answer or the document may tend to incriminate the witness or any other person, or may tend to establish his or her liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person or to a prosecution under any Act.






(3)


If a witness objects to answering a question on any of the grounds referred to in subsection (2), and if, but for this section or any Act of Canada, the witness would have been excused from answering the question, then, although the witness is by reason of this section or by reason of any Act of Canada compelled to answer, the answer given must not be used or receivable in evidence against that witness in any civil proceeding or in any proceeding under any Act.








Witness whose capacity is in doubt





5



(1)


If a proposed witness in a proceeding is a person under 14 years of age or a person whose mental capacity is challenged, the judge, justice or other presiding officer must, before permitting the person to give evidence, conduct an inquiry to determine whether






(a)


the person understands the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation, and






(b)


the person is able to communicate the evidence.






(2)


Subject to section 20 (3), a person referred to in subsection (1) of this section who understands the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation and is able to communicate the evidence must testify under oath or solemn affirmation.






(3)


A person referred to in subsection (1) who does not understand the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation but is able to communicate the evidence may testify on promising to tell the truth.






(4)


A person referred to in subsection (1) who neither understands the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation nor is able to communicate the evidence must not testify.






(5)


A party who challenges the mental capacity of a proposed witness who has reached 14 years of age has the burden of satisfying the judge, justice or other presiding officer that there is an issue as to the capacity of the proposed witness to testify under an oath or a solemn affirmation.








Person charged and spouse competent





6



A person charged with an offence, and the spouse of the person charged, is a competent witness whether the person charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person.








Parties to civil causes and their spouses may be witnesses





7



(1)


Except as provided by this Act, the parties to an action, suit, petition or other matter of a civil nature in any of the courts of British Columbia, and their spouses, are competent as witnesses and compellable to attend and give evidence in the same manner as they would be if not parties, or spouses of the parties, to the proceedings.






(2)


Despite any rule to the contrary, a spouse may in proceedings in court give evidence that he or she did or did not have sexual intercourse with the other spouse at any time or within any period of time before or during the marriage.








Communications made during marriage need not be disclosed





8



A spouse is not compellable to disclose any communication made to him or her by the other spouse during the marriage.








In actions by or against mentally disordered persons





9



In an action or proceeding by or against a person






(a)


who is found to be of unsound mind, or






(b)


who is a patient in a Provincial or other mental health facility,


an opposite or interested party is not entitled to obtain a verdict, judgment or decision, on his or her own evidence, unless that evidence is corroborated by other material evidence.








Evidence of experts





10



(1)


In this section and sections 11 and 12,

"proceeding"

includes a quasi-judicial or administrative hearing but does not include a proceeding in the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court or the Provincial Court.






(2)


This section and section 11 do not apply to proceedings of a tribunal, commission, board or other similar body that enacts or makes its own rules for the introduction of expert evidence and the testimony of experts, and if there is a conflict between any such rules and this section or section 11, those rules apply.






(3)


A statement in writing setting out the opinion of an expert is admissible in evidence in a proceeding without proof of the expert's signature if, at least 30 days before the statement is given in evidence, a copy of the written statement is furnished to every party to the proceeding that is adverse in interest to the party tendering the statement.






(4)


The assertion of qualifications as an expert in a written statement is proof of the qualifications.






(5)


If the written statement of an expert is given in evidence in a proceeding, any party to the proceeding may require the expert to be called as a witness.






(6)


If an expert has been required to give evidence under subsection (5) and the person presiding at the hearing is of the opinion that the evidence obtained does not materially add to the information in the statement furnished under subsection (3), the person presiding may order the party that required the attendance of the expert to pay, as costs, a sum the person presiding considers appropriate.








Testimony of experts





11



(1)


A person must not give, within the scope of that person's expertise, evidence of his or her opinion in a proceeding unless a written statement of that opinion and the facts on which that opinion is formed has been furnished, at least 30 days before the expert testifies, to every party that is adverse in interest to the party tendering the evidence of the expert.






(2)


Despite subsection (1), the person presiding in a proceeding may, on his or her own initiative or on the application of a party, do one of the following:






(a)


if the statement has not been furnished, order that the expert may testify;






(b)


if the statement was furnished less than 30 days before the expert is to testify, order that the expert may testify;






(c)


order that the expert must be allowed to testify if the statement is furnished within a time less than 30 days before the expert is to testify, and specify the time;






(d)


if it appears that a party will tender the evidence of an expert in the proceeding, order that a statement be furnished at a time earlier than 30 days before the expert is to testify and specify the time by which the statement must be furnished.






(3)


For the purpose of proving that a copy of a written statement was furnished to a party to a proceeding, the person presiding at the hearing may accept an affidavit made by the person who furnished the statement.
