Bodies of water





55



(1)


If Crown land is or has, before March 27, 1961, been disposed of by the government by Crown grant, and the map or plan attached to the grant shows a lake, river, stream or other body of water coloured, outlined or designated in a colour other than red, no part of the bed or shore of the body of water below its natural boundary passes or is deemed to have passed to the person acquiring the grant unless






(a)


there is express provision in the grant to the contrary, or

the minister endorses a declaration on the plan under section 58.






(2)


Nothing in any Act or rule of law to the contrary is to be construed to vest or to have vested in any person the land that comprises the bed or shore of the body of water below the natural boundary, and despite an indefeasible or absolute title to land, the title must be construed accordingly.






(3)


When land, the title to which has been forfeited, reverted or otherwise returned to the government, is or has been granted by the government and the grant does not have a map or plan attached but describes the land granted by reference to its official plan, the description used is deemed not to include or to have included any land below the natural boundary of the body of water coloured, outlined or designated in a colour other than red on the map or plan attached to the last preceding Crown grant of that land, and the grant must be construed accordingly.






(4)


Despite a rule of law to the contrary, if Crown land bordering on a lake, river, stream or a body of water is or has been granted by the government, in the absence of an express provision in the Crown grant to the contrary, no part of the bed or shore of the body of water below its natural boundary passes or is deemed to have passed to the person acquiring the land, and the Crown grant must be construed accordingly.








Application

Section 55 (1), (2) and (3) applies regardless of the area shown on the Crown grant or on the official plan, and the area of land shown on the map or plan attached to the Crown grant must not be reduced by any lettering or numbering on the map or plan.

(a)


before January 3, 1977, 20.1168 m in width, and






(b)


after January 2, 1977, 20 m in width.








Application to include body of water or road in subdivision





58



(1)


If doubt exists whether a body of water or road shown on the map or plan attached to a grant from the government is included in the grant, or whether it is in the public interest that the part coloured other than in red need be retained by the government, a person proposing to subdivide may apply to the minister for a declaration of intention about that part.






(2)


The application must be accompanied by a print of the proposed plan of subdivision.






(3)


On receiving a plan certified by the registrar as being otherwise acceptable for deposit, the minister may, if the minister considers it advisable, endorse a declaration on the plan that the land is included in the grant or need not be retained by the government.
