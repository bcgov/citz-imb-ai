Age of Majority Act
[RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 7






Age of majority




1

(1)


From April 15, 1970,




(a)

a person reaches the age of majority on becoming age 19 instead of age
21, and




(b)

a person who on that date has reached age 19 but not 21 is deemed to
have reached majority on that date.




(2)

Subsection (1) applies for the purposes of




(a)

any rule of law, and




(b)

in the absence of a definition or of an indication of a contrary
intention, for the interpretation of
"full age"
,
"infant"
,
"infancy"
,
"minor"
,
"minority"
and similar expressions in




(i)

an enactment whenever enacted, and




(ii)

a deed, will or other instrument of whatever nature, not being an
enactment, made on or after April 15, 1970.




(3)

The use of the words or similar expressions referred to in subsection
(2) does not in itself indicate a contrary intention under that
subsection, without some further indication of a contrary intention.




(4)

In an enactment other than this Act, a reference to age 21 must be
read as a reference to age 19.




(5)

The Lieutenant Governor in Council may, by order, amend an enactment
or bylaw of a local government passed on or before
April 15, 1970, by substituting a reference to age 19 for a
reference to age 21.




(6)

An amendment may be made applicable to a class of enactment or bylaw.




(7)

Despite any rule of law, a will or codicil executed before April 15,
1970 is deemed, for the purposes of this Act, not to have been made on
or after that date only because the will or codicil is confirmed by a
codicil executed on or after that date.






References to age in court orders




2

(1)


In an order or direction of a court made before April 15, 1970 a
reference to age 21 or to an age between 19 and 21, or to any of the
expressions referred to in section 1 (2), must be read as a reference
to age 19 unless a contrary intention is indicated.




(2)

The use of the phrase "21 years" in an order does not in itself
indicate a contrary intention under subsection (1) without some
further indication of a contrary intention.






Existing rights preserved




3


This Act does not prejudice a right of action or a defence to an
action that is based on the age of a party and that was in existence
at the time the cause of action arose, and the law that was in force
immediately before April 15, 1970 applies despite this Act.






Definition of "minor"




4


A person who has not reached the age of majority may be described as a
minor instead of as an infant, and
"minor"
means such a person.






Accumulations in deed, will or instrument




5


This Act does not invalidate a direction for accumulation expressed in
a settlement or other disposition made by deed, will or other
instrument and executed before April 15, 1970 that, but for this
Act, was a permissible period of accumulation.






Repealed




6


[Repealed 2012-13-33.]






Incorporation of enactment in deed, will or instrument




7


This Act does not affect the interpretation of an enactment that is
incorporated in and has effect as part of a deed, will or other
instrument, the interpretation of which is not affected by
section 1.
