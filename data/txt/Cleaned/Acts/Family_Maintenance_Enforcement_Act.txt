is reduced or cancelled as the court considers appropriate.

(3)


If the court is satisfied at a default hearing that the debtor is, for valid reasons, unable to pay the arrears in full or to make subsequent payments under the maintenance order, the court may

order the debtor to make periodic payments under the maintenance order in a reduced amount and for a term specified by the court, with the amount by which the payments are reduced being added to the arrears, and






(b)


make one or more of the orders described in subsection (1) (a), (b) or (d) to (f).

The court may make an order under subsection (1), (2) or (11) in the absence of the debtor if the debtor was served with a summons issued under section 19 or was apprehended under a warrant issued under section 20.






(6)


Imprisonment of a debtor under this section does not discharge arrears owing under a maintenance order.






(7)


If the court is satisfied that there has been a change in the circumstances of the debtor since an order was made under subsection (1) or (3), and that the change has resulted in the debtor's inability to comply with that order, the court may vary the order without reducing or cancelling the aggregate of the arrears required to be paid under the order.






(8)

(b)


a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the debtor to bring the debtor before the court to show cause why the order should not be enforced.






(2)

(a)


to pay an amount not exceeding $5 000 for the benefit of the creditor, or






(b)


to be imprisoned for a term not exceeding 30 days.

(a)


the debtor has paid the full amount required under section 21 (1) (e),






(b)


there has been a change in the circumstances of the debtor since the order was made under section 21 (1) (e) and the change has resulted in the debtor's inability to pay the full amount required under that section, or

(b)


it would be a grave injustice to order the imprisonment of the debtor,

Attachment orders





24



(1)


If at a default hearing or other proceeding the court finds that a debtor who has defaulted in a payment required under a maintenance order is receiving or entitled to receive wages, salary or other remuneration from a person employing or engaging the services of the debtor, or is receiving or entitled to receive a benefit, the court must make an attachment order unless it would be unfair to the debtor to do so.






(2)


The fact that an attachment order would reveal to a person who employs or engages the services of the debtor that the debtor owes arrears of maintenance is not sufficient to make the order unfair to the debtor.






(3)


The attachment order must direct a person who, either when the order is made or at any time while the order is in effect, employs or engages the services of the debtor or pays a benefit to do the following:






(a)


deduct from the money or benefit due and owing and from time to time becoming due and owing to the debtor the amount required by the order;






(b)


if the maintenance order is filed with the director, send to the director, within 5 days after each amount is deducted in accordance with the attachment order, a cheque or money order payable to the person specified in the attachment order;






(c)


if the maintenance order is not filed with the director, pay each amount deducted to the person specified in the order within 5 days after it is deducted.






(4)


An attachment order must be served on every person who during the period the order is in effect employs or engages the services of the debtor or pays a benefit and, when served, binds that person, without further service, for as long as the order remains in effect and the debtor is entitled to receive wages, salary or other remuneration, or to receive a benefit from that person.






(5)


An attachment order remains in effect until






(a)


the date specified in the order, or






(b)


the court, on application by the debtor or by an attachee, orders otherwise,


whichever occurs first.






(6)


On application by the creditor or the director, the court may order an attachee who fails to comply with an attachment order served on the attachee to pay the amount the attachee has failed to pay.






(7)


A payment order under subsection (6) may be enforced in any manner that a maintenance order may be enforced.






(8)


Payment made by an attachee to the court or the person specified in the attachment order discharges the obligation of the attachee to the debtor under the maintenance order to the extent of the payment.






(9)


An attachment order made before or after April 10, 1995 is deemed to contain the directions set out in subsection (3) (b) and (c), despite the terms of the order.

(1)


A notice of maintenance order may be registered in a land title office in the same manner as a charge is registered, and the maintenance order to which the notice relates is deemed for the purposes of Part 5 of the

(4.1)


If a notice of maintenance order is registered under this section and the maintenance order to which the notice relates is varied, a notice of maintenance order in respect of the varied maintenance order is deemed to be registered and has the same priority as the registered notice of maintenance order.

Court Order Enforcement Act


do not apply in respect of a notice of maintenance order registered under this section.

(8)


Before signing a discharge or postponement of a notice of maintenance order under subsection (7), the director must send by ordinary mail to the creditor a notice of the director's intention to sign the discharge or postponement.

the person against whose land a notice of maintenance order is registered, or

(1)


The Lieutenant Governor in Council may prescribe the circumstances in which, for the purpose of enforcing a maintenance order, a claim may be registered by the director under the


Miscellaneous Registrations Act, 1992


, against the personal property of a debtor.






(2)


Registration of a claim under the


Miscellaneous Registrations Act, 1992


, in respect of a maintenance order in circumstances prescribed under subsection (1) creates, in favour of the director for payment as provided for under section 10, a lien on the personal property against which the claim is registered.

(a)


the amount of any arrears of maintenance accrued before the claim is registered, and






(b)


the amount of any arrears of maintenance that accrues while the claim is registered.






(4)


The lien created under subsection (2) has priority, for the total amount determined under subsection (3), over any other claim that is registered and any security interest that is perfected after the lien is created, even though part of that amount is for arrears, interest and other sums that accrue after the other claim is registered or after the security interest is perfected.






(5)


Despite subsection (4), the lien created under subsection (2) does not have priority over






(a)


liens for wages due to workers by their employers, and






(b)


liens under section 265 of the


Workers Compensation Act


.






(6)


The lien created under subsection (2) continues






(a)

until the arrears are paid,


whichever happens first.

Priority over other judgment debts





28



(1)


Despite any other Act, a maintenance order, whether filed with the director or not, takes priority over any other unsecured judgment debt of the debtor regardless of when an enforcement process is issued or served.






(2)


The priority under subsection (1) does not apply to arrears of maintenance owing under a maintenance order that were owing more than one year before the date on which the creditor initiated the current proceedings to enforce the maintenance order.

(5)


The director may hold a deposit received under subsection (4) until the debtor has not been in arrears under the maintenance order for at least 9 consecutive months since the deposit was given, in which case the deposit may be applied to future maintenance payments, or returned to the debtor, as the director considers appropriate.
