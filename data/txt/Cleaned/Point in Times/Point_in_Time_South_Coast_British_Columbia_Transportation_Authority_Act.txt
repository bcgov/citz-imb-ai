appointment takes effect;




(b)

if the replacement commissioner assumes office after July 31 in a
year, the budgets for the fiscal year in which the replacement
appointment takes effect and for the following fiscal year.

(a)

promptly after January 1, 2008, 1/20 of 1% of the previous year's
farebox revenue;




(b)

at the beginning of each subsequent quarter of 2008, 1/3 of the
expenses estimated for the last 9 months of 2008 in the budget
prepared by the commissioner under section 237 (1).






Payments required after 2008




239


At the beginning of each quarter of a fiscal year after 2008, the

(a)

one-quarter of the expenses estimated in the budget applicable to
the fiscal year, and




(b)

the amount, if any, payable to the commissioner on that date under
section 240 or 241.






Special levy




240

(1)


At any time in a fiscal year, the commissioner may submit to the
authority a request for a special levy to obtain money additional
to that payable for that fiscal year under section 239 (a) if




(a)

the money is required to satisfy expenses, and




(b)

it is essential to the commissioner's ability to carry out the
commissioner's duties under this Act in that fiscal year that the
additional money sought by the special levy be provided to fund
those expenses.




(2)

The commissioner must not submit a levy request under subsection
(1) more than once in any fiscal year.




(3)

Subject to subsection (4) and to section 241, if a levy request is
made under subsection (1) of this section in a fiscal year, the
authority must, at the beginning of each quarter of that fiscal
year following the request, pay to the commissioner, in addition
to the amount payable under section 239 (a), that fraction of the
amount requested by the commissioner in the levy request that is
equal to one divided by the number of remaining whole quarters in
the fiscal year.




(4)

Subject to section 241, if, in a fiscal year, a levy request is
made under subsection (1) of this section at a time when it is
impracticable to include the amount requested in any quarterly
payment to be paid in that fiscal year in accordance with
subsection (3), the authority must, promptly after the levy
request, pay to the commissioner the amount requested by the
commissioner in the levy request.






Dispute resolution process




241

(1)


If the authority considers that the expenses included by the
commissioner in a budget or levy request for a fiscal year exceed
the amount that is reasonably required to cover the expenses
referred to in section 236 for that fiscal year, the authority may
require that the matter be referred to arbitration by delivering
to the commissioner, within one month after receipt of the budget
or levy request, as the case may be, a notice requiring that
arbitration.




(2)

If the authority does not provide a notice under subsection (1)
within one month after receipt of a budget or levy request, as the
case may be,




(a)

the budget or levy request and the estimated expenses are deemed
to have been agreed on by the authority and the commissioner, and




(b)

the authority must make the payments required under section 239 or
240, as the case may be, in relation to that budget or levy
request.




(3)

If a notice requiring arbitration is provided by the authority
under subsection (1) within one month after receipt of a budget or
levy request, the
International Commercial Arbitration Act
applies to the dispute and, for that purpose,




(a)

the authority and the commissioner are deemed to have agreed to
arbitrate the dispute referred to in paragraph (b) of this
subsection as if the commissioner were the claimant and the
authority were the respondent, and are deemed for that purpose to
have entered into an arbitration agreement within the meaning of
section 7 of the
International Commercial Arbitration Act
,




(b)

the dispute that is deemed to be submitted to arbitration is
whether the expenses sought by the budget or the expenses sought
by the levy request, as the case may be, exceed the amount that is
reasonably required to cover the expenses referred to in section
236 for that fiscal year,




(c)

any fees, costs, deposits and expenses payable in relation to the
arbitration are to be borne by the authority, and no costs or
interest are to be awarded to either party, and




(d)

the arbitration must be an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, and
if the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within 15 days
after receipt by the commissioner of the notice requiring
arbitration under subsection (1) of this section, or, in the case
of an appointment required under section 15 of the
International Commercial Arbitration Act
, within 15 days after the termination of the mandate of the
arbitrator to be replaced, the appointment must be made by the
minister.




(4)

Even though a dispute as to the reasonableness of the
commissioner's expenses sought by the budget, or the expenses
sought by the levy request, as the case may be, has been referred
to arbitration under subsection (1), the authority must, subject
to subsection (5), make the payments required under section 239 or
240, as the case may be.




(5)

If, as a result of an arbitration under subsection (1), the
arbitrator determines that the expenses sought by the budget, or
the expenses sought by the levy request, as the case may be, are
greater than or are less than the amount that is reasonably
required to cover the expenses referred to in section 236 for the
applicable fiscal year, the authority must, at the beginning of
each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year, pay the amount
determined by the following formula:





arbitrated expenses - amounts paid








remaining quarters





where



"arbitrated expenses" is the amount that is determined by the
arbitration to be reasonably required to cover the expenses
referred to in section 236 for that fiscal year,


"amounts paid" is the total of the amounts paid by the authority
under sections 239 and 240 in the fiscal year in respect of which
the expenses are sought, and


"remaining quarters" is the number of whole quarters in the fiscal
year for which no payments have been made under sections 239 and
240.
