or obscures the view of an object in the background, and is
expressed numerically from 0 percent (transparent) to 100 percent
(opaque);



"PM
10
"

means particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or
equal to a nominal 10 micrometres;


"treatment works"
means abatement equipment that is used for the specific purpose of
reducing the release of air contaminants to the atmosphere;


"wood residue incinerator"
means a combustion facility which includes combustion controls and
particulate collection equipment for the destruction of wood residue

Beehive burners and unmodified silo burners



2

(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person
must not use a beehive burner, unmodified silo burner or modified
silo burner to dispose of wood residue.


(2)  A burner facility operator listed in column 1 of
Schedule 1 may use a beehive burner or unmodified silo burner to
dispose of wood residue until the date set out opposite in Column
2 if


(a) on December 31, 1995, the burner facility operator is
authorized to do so by a valid and subsisting permit,


(b) the burner facility operator undertakes to a director to
complete the necessary modifications to meet the conditions set
out opposite in Column 3 by July 31, 2001, if applicable, and


(c) after July 31, 2001, if applicable, the burner facility
is operated using the equipment, practices and operating criteria
set out opposite in Column 3.


(2.1)  Despite subsection (2), a permit continues to be
required to use a beehive burner or unmodified silo burner and all
terms and conditions of the permit apply except where there is a
conflict with this regulation, in which case this regulation
applies.


(2.2)  Despite subsection (2), a burner facility operator
listed in column 1 of Schedule 1 may use a beehive burner,
unmodified silo burner, or modified silo burner to dispose of wood
residue until June 30, 2005, if the burner facility operator
submits to a director, by July 31, 2003, a plan and a schedule for
implementation of the plan that specify


(a) equipment improvements or modifications or operational
modifications the burner facility operator will undertake to
minimize the emissions from the burner facility, and


(b) when the improvements or modifications will be made.


(2.3)  On review of the plan and schedule referred to in
subsection (2.2) and consideration of the site specific
circumstances, the director, by written notice to the burner
facility operator within 30 days of receipt of the plan and
schedule, may require changes to the plan and schedule that the
director considers necessary to assure adequate pollution
prevention and public health protection.


(3)  Subject to subsection (4), a burner facility operator in
Column 1 of Schedule 1 may, on application to a director, use a
beehive burner or unmodified silo burner to dispose of wood
residue on and after the date set out opposite in Column 2 if, in
the opinion of the director, the burner facility operator is
unable to use an alternative means of disposing of wood residue
because of an emergency, labour dispute or work stoppage.


(4)  An application under subsection (3) may be authorized by
the director


(a) for a period not exceeding 90 operating days, or


(b) with the approval of the minister, for a period exceeding
90 operating days,


but the authorization terminates when the emergency, labour
dispute or work stoppage ends.


(4.1)  Subsections (3) and (4) apply to a burner facility
operator listed in Schedule 3.


(5)  A person who is not a burner facility operator listed in
Column 1 of Schedule 1 or in Schedule 3 may use a beehive burner
or unmodified silo burner if the person is, on December 31, 1995,
authorized to do so by a valid and subsisting permit.


(6)  The date in Column 2 of Schedule 1 for a burner facility
operator set out opposite in Column 1 is extended to a date not
later than December 31, 2004 determined by a director if


(a) the burner facility operator submits a burner phase out
plan and schedule to the director,


(b) that plan and schedule demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the director that the burner facility operator has entered into
agreements to implement alternative methods to use or dispose of
the wood residue, and


(c) the director is satisfied that the phase out plan will be
implemented by that date.


(7)  On application to the minister, a director may approve,
for protection of the environment, the construction and use of a
modified silo burner, subject to a requirement that the applicant
operate the burner in accordance with a plan and specifications
incorporated into and forming a part of a permit issued under
section 14 of the Act.


(8)  Despite the fees regulation, for the purposes of
determining the fee payable to operate a burner facility by a
burner facility operator listed in Column 1 of Schedule 1 or in
Schedule 3, the fee per tonne discharged set out in Column 2 of
Schedule B of the fees regulation for the Total Particulate in
Column 1 of that Schedule is deemed


(a) for the period January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001 to be
$110,


(b) for the period January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 to be
$120,


(c) for the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003 to be
$130,


(d) for the period January 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005 to be
$140, and

(d.1) commencing July 1, 2005 to be $208,

and the fee payable per tonne of discharged total particulate by
all other burner facility operators to operate a beehive burner or
unmodified silo burner is


(e) $16.30 for the period January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2005,
and

(f) $24.21 commencing July 1, 2005.

(9)  For the purposes of subsection (8), the fee must be
calculated using the discharge as authorized in the permit or
approval.
