in the Board's direction




(a)

to an independent operator who is neither an employer nor a worker
as though the independent operator was a worker, or




(b)

to an employer as though the employer was a worker.




(3)

does not exempt the employer, as an employer, from the application
of this Part.






Extending application




3

(1) to (3)


[Repealed 1993-34-2.]




(4)

Admissions under this section may be made at the time, in the
manner, subject to the terms and conditions and for the period the

(5)

Where a person or group of persons carries on an undertaking that
the Board thinks is in the public interest, the Board may, on the
terms and conditions it directs,




(a)

deem the person or group of persons, whether or not any of them
receive payment for their services, to be workers for the purposes
of this Act;




(b)

on approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, deem the person
or group of persons to be workers of the Crown in right of the

$141.19
per week or more than the maximum wage rate provided under section
33.

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]





(6)

Where the Minister of Education, Skills and Training and the
Minister of Labour approve a vocational or training program, and a
school or other location as a place of that vocational or training
program, the Board may, at the request of either minister, deem
any person or class of persons enrolled in the program to be
workers of the Crown in right of the Province and compensation
under this Act is then payable out of the accident fund for
injuries arising out of and in the course of training for those
workers, but where the injury results in a period of temporary
disability with no loss of earnings,




(a)

a health care benefit only is payable except as provided in
paragraph (b); and




(b)

where training allowances paid by Canada or the Province are
suspended, the Board may, for the period it considers advisable,
pay compensation in the amount of the training allowance.




(7)

program or other program of self improvement involving work,
whether or not the person or group receives payment for the work,

determines.






Fishing industry




4

(1)


The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations to




(a)

define the terms used in this section, and, for this purpose, the
term "fish" may be defined to include any species of animal living
in water, and the term "commercial fisher" may be defined to
include the master and crew of a fishing vessel, the master and
crew of a fish packing vessel and any other person who contributes
in any manner to the catching or landing of fish for sale or
commercial use;




(b)

provide that any provision of Part 1 relating to workers applies
or may be applied to any commercial fishers working in or out of
British Columbia ports, or on or about the waters of British
Columbia, or resident in the Province, notwithstanding that they
may not otherwise be workers under this Act;




(c)

provide that any provision of Part 1 relating to employers applies
or may be applied to any commercial buyers or other commercial
recipients of fish, or to any person engaged in the Province in
transmitting payments to commercial fishers, notwithstanding that
they may not otherwise be employers under this Act, and, to the
extent the regulations provide, each buyer, recipient or payor is
deemed to be the employer of all commercial fishers who
contributed in any manner to the catching or landing of the fish
bought, obtained or paid for by or through that person;




(d)

provide that methods of calculating and levying assessments
additional to or different from the methods otherwise provided
under Part 1 may be used for levying assessments for the purposes
of this Part on commercial buyers and other commercial recipients
of fish, and on a person engaged in the Province in transmitting
payments to commercial fishers for fish whether landed in the
Province or elsewhere;




(e)

create obligations, different from the terms of this Act, on
commercial buyers and commercial recipients of fish, and masters
of fishing vessels, to report to the Board injuries and
occupational diseases sustained by commercial fishers, and to
provide transportation for initial medical treatment;




(f)

exclude a portion of the fishing industry or a category of workers
or employers in that industry to whom a provision of this Part
would otherwise apply from the application of that provision, and
to substitute provisions contained in regulations made under this
section; and




(g)

delegate to the Board to the extent the regulations provide any
power conferred by this section.




(2)

Where it appears to the Board that a provision of this Act or of a
regulation made under another section of this Act is inappropriate
or unworkable in relation to commercial fishers, the fishing
industry or commercial buyers, or other commercial recipients of
the fish, the Board may, by regulation, make the rules and give
the decisions it considers fair and appropriate having regard to
the intent that all commercial fishers must as far as possible
receive the benefit of and be subject to Part 1.




(3)

Where the death of a commercial fisher resident in British
Columbia arises out of and in the course of his or her occupation
in the Province or waters off the Province after January 1, 1975,
and the death is not otherwise compensable under this Part, the
Board may treat the death in the same manner as if the commercial
fisher were a worker employed by the Crown in right of the
Province.




Division 2 — Compensation





Compensation for personal injury




5

(1)


Where, in an industry within the scope of this Part, personal
injury or death arising out of and in the course of the employment
is caused to a worker, compensation as provided by this Part must
be paid by the Board out of the accident fund.




(2)

Where an injury disables a worker from earning full wages at the
work at which the worker was employed, compensation is payable
under this Part from the first working day following the day of
the injury; but a health care benefit only is payable under this
Part in respect of the day of the injury.




(3)

Where the injury is attributable solely to the serious and wilful
misconduct of the worker, compensation is not payable unless the
injury results in death or serious or permanent disablement.




(4)

In cases where the injury is caused by accident, where the
accident arose out of the employment, unless the contrary is
shown, it must be presumed that it occurred in the course of the
employment; and where the accident occurred in the course of the
employment, unless the contrary is shown, it must be presumed that
it arose out of the employment.




(5)

Where the personal injury or disease is superimposed on an already
existing disability, compensation must be allowed only for the
proportion of the disability following the personal injury or
disease that may reasonably be attributed to the personal injury
or disease. The measure of the disability attributable to the
personal injury or disease must, unless it is otherwise shown, be
the amount of the difference between the worker's disability
before and disability after the occurrence of the personal injury
or disease.






Mental disorder




5.1

(1)


Subject to subsection (2), a worker is entitled to compensation
for a mental disorder that does not result from an injury for
which the worker is otherwise entitled to compensation, only if
the mental disorder




(a)

either




(i)

is a reaction to one or more traumatic events arising out of and
in the course of the worker's employment, or




(ii)

is predominantly caused by a significant work-related stressor,
including bullying or harassment, or a cumulative series of
significant work-related stressors, arising out of and in the
course of the worker's employment,




(b)

is diagnosed by a psychiatrist or psychologist as a mental or
physical condition that is described in the most recent American
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders at the time of the diagnosis, and




(c)

is not caused by a decision of the worker's employer relating to
the worker's employment, including a decision to change the work
to be performed or the working conditions, to discipline the
worker or to terminate the worker's employment.




(1.1)

If a worker who is or has been employed in an eligible occupation




(a)

is exposed to one or more traumatic events arising out of and in
the course of the worker's employment in that eligible occupation,
and




(b)

has a mental disorder that is recognized, in the most recent
American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, at the time of the diagnosis of the
mental disorder under subsection (1) (b) of this section, as a
mental or physical condition that may arise from exposure to a
traumatic event,


the mental disorder must be presumed to be a reaction to the one
or more traumatic events arising out of and in the course of the
worker's employment in that eligible occupation, unless the
contrary is proved.




(2)

The Board may require that a psychiatrist or psychologist
appointed by the Board review a diagnosis made for the purposes of
subsection (1) (b) and may consider that review in determining
whether a worker is entitled to compensation for a mental
disorder.




(3)

Section 56 (1) applies to a psychiatrist or psychologist who makes
a diagnosis referred to in this section.




(4)

In this section:



"correctional officer"

means a correctional officer as defined by regulation of the

Health Professions Act
in respect of the health profession of psychology, or




(b)

entitled to practise as a psychologist under the laws of another
province;


"sheriff"
means a person lawfully holding the office of sheriff or lawfully
performing the duties of sheriff by way of delegation,
substitution, temporary appointment or otherwise.






Occupational disease




6

(1)


Where




(a)

a worker suffers from an occupational disease and is thereby
disabled from earning full wages at the work at which the worker
was employed or the death of a worker is caused by an occupational
disease; and




(b)

the disease is due to the nature of any employment in which the
worker was employed, whether under one or more employments,


compensation is payable under this Part as if the disease were a
personal injury arising out of and in the course of that
employment. A health care benefit may be paid although the worker
is not disabled from earning full wages at the work at which he or
she was employed.




(2)

The date of disablement must be treated as the occurrence of the
injury.




(3)

If the worker at or immediately before the date of the disablement
was employed in a process or industry mentioned in the second
column of Schedule B, and the disease contracted is the disease in
the first column of the schedule set opposite to the description
of the process, the disease is deemed to have been due to the
nature of that employment unless the contrary is proved.




(4)

[Repealed 2002-56-3.]




(4.1)

The Board may, by regulation,




(a)

add to or delete from Schedule B a disease that, in the opinion of
the Board, is an occupational disease,




(b)

add to or delete from Schedule B a process or an industry, and




(c)

set terms, conditions and limitations for the purposes of
paragraphs (a) and (b).

conditions and with the limitations set by the Board.




(5)

[Repealed 1998-50-2.]




(6)

[Repealed 1994-24-2.]




(7)

"Silicosis"
means a fibrotic condition of the lungs caused by the inhalation
of silica dust.




(8)

A worker in the metalliferous mining industry or coal mining
industry who becomes disabled from uncomplicated silicosis or from
silicosis complicated with tuberculosis is entitled to
compensation for total or partial disability as provided by this
Part, and where death results from the disability, the dependants
of the worker are entitled to compensation as provided by this
Part; but neither a worker nor a dependant is entitled to
compensation for the disability or death unless the worker




(a)

has been a resident of the Province for a period of at least 3
years last preceding the disablement, or unless at least 2/3 of
the worker's exposure to dust containing silica was in the
Province;




(b)

was free from silicosis and tuberculosis before being first
exposed to dust containing silica in the metalliferous mining or
coal mining industry in this Province; and




(c)

has been a worker exposed to dust containing silica in the
metalliferous mining or coal mining industry in the Province for a
period or periods aggregating 3 years preceding his or her
disablement, or for a lesser period if the worker was not exposed
to dust containing silica anywhere except in this Province.




(9)

If the worker has been exposed to the inhalation of dust
containing silica in 2 or more classes or subclasses of industry
in the Province, the Board may apportion the cost of compensation
among the funds provided by those classes or subclasses on the
basis of the duration and severity of the exposure in each.




(10)

When a worker has sustained pulmonary injury by a disabling form
of pneumoconiosis as a result of exposure to dust conditions that
are deemed by the Board to have contributed to the development of
the disease in employment in the Province in an industry in which
that disease is an occupational disease under this Part, the
worker or the worker's dependants is or are entitled to
compensation only if the worker was free from pneumoconiosis and
tuberculosis before being first exposed to those dust conditions
in the Province, and if the worker's residence and exposure to the
dust conditions have been of the duration required to entitle a
worker to compensation for silicosis under subsection (8), and the
cost of compensation may be apportioned in the manner provided by
subsection (9).




(11)

Where a deceased worker was, at the date of his or her death,
under the age of 70 years and suffering from an occupational
disease of a type that impairs the capacity of function of the
lungs, and where the death was caused by some ailment or
impairment of the lungs or heart of non-traumatic origin, it must
be conclusively presumed that the death resulted from the
occupational disease.






Firefighters' occupational disease or personal injury presumption




6.1

(1)


[Repealed 2019-10-3.]




(1.1)

If a worker who is or has been a firefighter contracts primary
site lung cancer, the disease must be presumed to be due to the
nature of the worker's employment as a firefighter, unless the
contrary is proved.




(2)

If a worker who is or has been a firefighter contracts a
prescribed disease, the disease must be presumed to be due to the
nature of the worker's employment as a firefighter, unless the
contrary is proved.




(3)

The presumptions in subsections (1.1) and (2) apply only to a
worker who




(a)

has worked as a firefighter for the minimum cumulative period
prescribed for the disease, which minimum cumulative period may be
defined differently, and be different, for different categories of
firefighters,




(b)

throughout that period, has been regularly exposed to the hazards
of a fire scene, and




(c)

is first disabled from the disease on or after the following date,
as applicable:




(i)

in the case of a disease that, on or before the date this
subparagraph comes into force, was prescribed by regulation for
the purposes of subsection (2), April 11, 2005;




(ii)

in the case of primary site lung cancer, May 27, 2008;




(iii)

in the case of a disease that, after the date this subparagraph
comes into force, is prescribed by regulation for the purposes of
subsection (2), the date on which that regulation takes effect.




(3.1)

In addition to the requirements of subsection (3), the presumption
for a primary site lung cancer applies only if




(a)

the worker has, in his or her lifetime, smoked a combined total of
fewer than 365 cigarettes, cigars and pipes, or




(b)

the worker has been a non-smoker of tobacco products immediately
before the date on which the worker is first disabled from that

includes disease of the pericardium or coronary arteries;



"heart injury"

includes heart attack, cardiac arrest or arrhythmia.




(7)

If a worker is disabled as a result of a heart disease and was
employed as a firefighter at or immediately before the date of
disablement from the heart disease, the heart disease must be
presumed to be due to the nature of the worker's employment as a
firefighter, unless the contrary is proved.




(8)

If a worker is disabled as a result of a heart injury and was
employed as a firefighter at or immediately before the date of
disablement from the heart injury, the heart injury must be
presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the worker's
employment as a firefighter, unless the contrary is proved.




(9)

The presumptions in subsections (7) and (8) apply only to a worker
who




(a)

has been regularly exposed, throughout the worker's employment as
a firefighter, to the hazards of a fire scene, and

is first disabled as a result of the heart disease or heart
injury, as the case may be, on or after the date this subsection

Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act
, who has obtained a testing order under that Act respecting a
source individual;



"communicable disease"

means a communicable disease prescribed for the purposes of the
Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act
;



"source individual"

has the same meaning as in the
Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act
.




(2)

If a worker who is an applicant has contracted a communicable
disease, it must be presumed, unless there is evidence to the
contrary, that the communicable disease is due to the nature of
the worker's employment, if




(a)

the worker came into contact with the bodily substance of the
source individual in the course of the worker's employment, and




(b)

test results obtained under a testing order made under the
Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act
indicate that the source individual is infected with a pathogen
that causes the communicable disease contracted by the applicant.






Loss of hearing




7

(1)


Where a worker suffers loss of hearing of non-traumatic origin,
but arising out of and in the course of employment under this
Part, that is a greater loss than the minimum set out in Schedule
D, the worker is entitled to compensation under this Part.




(2)

Where the loss of hearing amounts to total deafness measured in
the manner set out in Schedule D, but with no loss of earnings
resulting from the loss of hearing, compensation must be
calculated as for a disability equivalent to 15% of total
disability under this Part.




(3)

Where the loss of hearing does not amount to total deafness, and
there is no loss of earnings resulting from the loss of hearing,
compensation must be calculated as for a lesser percentage of
total disability, and, unless otherwise ordered by the Board, must
be based on the percentages set out in Schedule D.




(3.1)

The Board may make regulations to amend Schedule D in respect of




(a)

the ranges of hearing loss,




(b)

the percentages of disability, and




(c)

the methods or frequencies to be used to measure hearing loss.




(4)

If a loss or reduction of earnings results from the loss of
hearing, the worker is entitled to compensation for a total or
partial disability as established under this Part.




(4.1)

Compensation paid for a worker's loss of hearing under subsection
(4) must not be less than the amount determined under subsection
(2) or (3).




(5)

Compensation under this section is not payable in respect of a
period prior to September 1, 1975; but future compensation under
this section is payable in respect of loss of hearing sustained by
exposure to causes of hearing loss in the Province either before
or after that date, unless the exposure to causes of hearing loss
terminated prior to that date.




(6)

An application for compensation under this section must be
accompanied or supported by a specialist's report and audiogram or
by other evidence of loss of hearing that the Board prescribes.




(7)

Where a worker suffers loss of hearing caused by exposure to
causes of hearing loss in 2 or more classes or subclasses of
industry in the Province, the Board may apportion the cost of
compensation among the funds provided by those classes or
subclasses on the basis of the duration or severity of the
exposure in each.






Injuries happening out of Province




8

(1)


Where the injury of a worker occurs while the worker is working
elsewhere than in the Province which would entitle the worker or
the worker's dependants to compensation under this Part if it
occurred in the Province, the Board must pay compensation under
this Part if




(a)

a place of business of the employer is situate in the Province;




(b)

the residence and usual place of employment of the worker are in
the Province;




(c)

the employment is such that the worker is required to work both in
and out of the Province; and

Interjurisdictional agreements and arrangements by the Board




8.1

(1)


The Board may enter into an agreement or make an arrangement with
Canada, a province or the appropriate authority of Canada or a
province to provide for




(a)

compensation, rehabilitation and health care to workers in
accordance with the standards established under this Act or
corresponding legislation in other jurisdictions,




(b)

administrative co-operation and assistance between jurisdictions
in all matters under this Act and corresponding legislation in
other jurisdictions, or




(c)

avoidance of duplication of assessments on workers' earnings.




(2)

An agreement or arrangement under subsection (1) may




(a)

waive or modify a residence or exposure requirement for
eligibility for compensation, rehabilitation or health care, or




(b)

provide for payment to the appropriate authority of Canada or a
province for compensation, rehabilitation costs, or health care
costs paid by it.






Election




9

(1)


Where by the law of the country or place in which the injury or
occupational disease occurs the worker or the worker's dependants
are entitled to compensation in respect of it, they must elect
whether they will claim compensation under the law of that country
or place or under this Part, and to give notice of the election.
If the election is not made and notice given, it must be presumed
that they have elected not to claim compensation under this Part;
but if there is in existence an agreement entered into, or
arrangement made, under section 8.1, any right of election is
subject to the terms of that agreement or arrangement.




(2)

Notice of the election must be given to the Board within 3 months
after the occurrence of the injury or disablement from
occupational disease, or, if it results in death, within 3 months
after the death, or within any longer period that either before or
after the expiration of the 3 months the Board allows.






Limitation of actions, election and subrogation




10

(1)


The provisions of this Part are in lieu of any right and rights of
action, statutory or otherwise, founded on a breach of duty of
care or any other cause of action, whether that duty or cause of
action is imposed by or arises by reason of law or contract,
express or implied, to which a worker, dependant or member of the
family of the worker is or may be entitled against the employer of
the worker, or against any employer within the scope of this Part,
or against any worker, in respect of any personal injury,
disablement or death arising out of and in the course of
employment and no action in respect of it lies. This provision
applies only when the action or conduct of the employer, the
employer's servant or agent, or the worker, which caused the
breach of duty arose out of and in the course of employment within
the scope of this Part.




(2)

Where the cause of the injury, disablement or death of a worker is
such that an action lies against some person, other than an
employer or worker within the scope of this Part, the worker or
dependant may claim compensation or may bring an action. If the
worker or dependant elects to claim compensation, he or she must
do so within 3 months of the occurrence of the injury or any
longer period that the Board allows.




(3)

Where the Board is satisfied that due to the worker's physical or
mental disability a worker is unable to exercise his or her right
of election, and undue hardship will result, it may pay the
compensation provided by this Part until the worker is able to
make an election. If the worker then elects not to claim
compensation, no further compensation may be paid, but the
compensation so paid is a first charge against any sum recovered.




(4)

An application filed by a parent, guardian or the Official
Guardian for compensation for the infant child of a deceased
worker is a valid election on behalf of that child.




(5)

If after trial, or after settlement out of court with the written
approval of the Board, less is recovered and collected than the
amount of the compensation to which the worker or dependant would
be entitled under this Part, the worker or dependant is entitled
to compensation under this Part to the extent of the amount of the
difference.




(6)

If the worker or dependant applies to the Board claiming
compensation under this Part, neither the making of the
application nor the payment of compensation under it restricts or
impairs any right of action against the party liable, but as to
every such claim the Board is subrogated to the rights of the
worker or dependant and may maintain an action in the name of the
worker or dependant or in the name of the Board; and if more is
recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to
which the worker or dependant would be entitled under this Part,
the amount of the excess, less costs and administration charges,
must be paid to the worker or dependant. The Board has exclusive
jurisdiction to determine whether to maintain an action or
compromise the right of action, and its decision is final and
conclusive.




(7)

If, in an action brought by a worker or dependant of a worker or
by the Board, it is found that the injury, disablement or death,
as the case may be, was due partly to a breach of duty of care of
one or more employers or workers under this Part, no damages,
contributions or indemnity are recoverable for the portion of the
loss or damage caused by the negligence of that employer or
worker; but the portion of the loss or damage caused by that
negligence must be determined although the employer or worker is
not a party to the action.




(8)

The provisions of this Part are in lieu of any right of action
that the employer of the injured or deceased worker is or may, in
respect of the personal injury or death of the worker, be entitled
to maintain against another employer within the scope of this
Part, or an independent operator to whom this Part applies by
direction under section 2 (2) (a); but where the Board considers
that




(a)

a substantial amount of compensation has been awarded as a result
of the injury or death of the worker; and




(b)

the injury or death was caused or substantially contributed to by
a serious breach of duty of care of an employer or an independent
operator to whom this Part applies by direction under section 2
(2) (a) in another class or subclass,


the Board may order that the compensation be charged, in whole or
in part, to the other class or subclass; but the provisions of
this subsection do not affect any right which an employer may have
against another employer, or an independent operator to whom this
Part applies by direction under section 2 (2) (a), arising out of
their indemnity agreement or contract.




(9)

For the purpose of this section,
"worker"
includes an employer admitted under section 2 (2).




(10)

In an action brought under this section, an award for damages is
to include




(a)

health care provided under this Part; and




(b)

wages and salary paid by an employer during the period of
disability for which regard has been had by the Board, or would
have been had if the worker had elected to claim compensation, in
fixing the amount of a periodical payment of compensation.




(11)

Costs may, notwithstanding that a salaried employee of the Board
acts as its solicitor or counsel, be awarded to and collected by
the Board in an action taken by the Board under this section.

Compensation cannot be waived




13

(1)

forego any benefit to which the worker or the worker's dependants
are or may become entitled under this Part, and every agreement to
that end is void.

No contribution from workers




14

(1)


It is not lawful for an employer, either directly or indirectly,
to deduct from the wages of the employer's worker any part of a
sum which the employer is or may become liable to pay into the
accident fund or otherwise under this Part, or to require or to
permit the worker to contribute in any manner toward indemnifying
the employer against a liability which the employer has incurred
or may incur under this Part.




(2)

Every person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence
against this Part and is liable to repay to the worker any sum
which has been so deducted from his or her wages or which he or
she has been required or permitted to pay in contravention of
subsection (1).






Compensation not assignable or liable to attachment




15


A sum payable as compensation or by way of commutation of a
periodic payment in respect of it is not capable of being
assigned, charged or attached, nor must it pass by operation of
law except to a personal representative, and a claim must not be
set off against it, except for money advanced by way of financial
or other social welfare assistance owing to the Province or to a
municipality, or for money owing to the accident fund.






Vocational rehabilitation




16

(1)


To aid in getting injured workers back to work or to assist in
lessening or removing a resulting handicap, the Board may take the
measures and make the expenditures from the accident fund that it
considers necessary or expedient, regardless of the date on which
the worker first became entitled to compensation.




(2)

Where compensation is payable under this Part as the result of the
death of a worker, the Board may make provisions and expenditures
for the training or retraining of a surviving dependent spouse,
regardless of the date of death.




(3)

The Board may, where it considers it advisable, provide
counselling and placement services to dependants.

that the age of that dependant, at the date of death of the
worker, is under the age of 50 years, and




(ii)

the monthly rate of compensation under this Part that would have
been payable if the deceased worker had, at the date of death,

compensation under this Part that would have been payable if the
deceased worker had, at the date of death, sustained a permanent
total disability; or




(iii)

the dependants are 3 or more children, a monthly payment of a sum

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]



subject, in all cases, to the minimum set out in paragraph (g);

must be the allowances that would be payable if the allowances
were calculated under those paragraphs in respect of a deceased
worker with average earnings of
$39 992.98
per annum;

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]





(h)

where there is




(i)

no dependent spouse or child entitled to compensation under this
section, but a worker leaves other dependants, a sum reasonable
and proportionate to the pecuniary loss suffered by those
dependants by reason of the death, to be determined by the Board,
but not exceeding in the whole
$657.01
per month for life or a lesser period as determined by the Board;
or

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]





(ii)

a dependent spouse, or a dependent child or children, entitled to
compensation under this section, but not a spouse and child or
children, and, in addition, the worker leaves a dependent parent
or parents, then, in addition to the compensation payable to the
spouse or children, a sum, reasonable and proportionate to the
pecuniary loss suffered by the dependent parent or parents by the
death, to be determined by the Board, but not exceeding
$657.01
per month for life or a lesser period as determined by the Board;

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]





(i)

where




(i)

no compensation is payable under the foregoing provisions of this
subsection; or




(ii)

the compensation is payable only to a spouse, a child or children
or a parent or parents,


but the worker leaves a spouse, child or parent who, though not
dependent on the worker's earnings at the time of the worker's
death, had a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit from the
continuation of the life of the worker, payments, at the
discretion of the Board, to that spouse, child or children, parent
or parents, but not to more than one of those categories, not
exceeding
$657.01
per month for life or a lesser period determined by the Board; and

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]





(j)

where the worker leaves no dependent surviving spouse, or the
surviving spouse subsequently dies, and the Board considers it
desirable to continue the existing household, and when a suitable
person acts as a foster parent in keeping up the household and
taking care of and maintaining the children entitled to
compensation, in a manner satisfactory to the Board, the same
allowance is payable to the foster parent and children as would
have been payable to a surviving spouse and children, and must
continue as long as those conditions continue.




(4)

Where an invalid spouse ceases to be an invalid, or a surviving
spouse with dependent children no longer has dependent children or
there is a reduction in the number of dependent children, the
surviving spouse or children is then entitled to the same category
of benefits as would have been payable if the death of the worker
had occurred on the date the invalid spouse ceases to be an
invalid or the surviving spouse no longer has dependent children,
or the number of dependent children is reduced, as the case may
be.




(5)

Where there is a surviving spouse and a child or children, and the
surviving spouse subsequently dies, the allowances to the children
must, if they are in other respects eligible, continue and be
calculated in the same manner as if the worker had died leaving no
dependent spouse.




(6)

Where at the date of death a spouse is not an invalid, but is
suffering from a disability that results in a substantial
impairment of earning capacity, the Board may, having regard to
the degree of disability or the extent of impairment of earning
capacity, pay the spouse a proportion of the compensation that
would have been payable if the spouse had been an invalid.




(7)

Where 2 workers are spouses and both are contributing to the
support of a common household, each is deemed to be a dependant of
the other.




(8)

Where parents contribute to the support of a common household at
which their children also reside, the children are deemed to be
dependants of the parent whose death is compensable under this
Part.




(9)

Where compensation is payable as the result of the death of a
worker, or of injury resulting in death, and where at the date of
death the worker and dependent spouse were living separate and
apart, and




(a)

there was in force at the date of death a court order or
separation agreement providing periodic payments for support of
the dependent spouse, or children living with that spouse, no
compensation under subsection (3) is payable to the spouse or
children living with the spouse; but monthly payments must be made
in respect of that spouse and those children equal to the periodic
payments due under the order or agreement; or




(b)

there was no court order or separation agreement in force at the
date of death providing periodic payments for support of the
dependent spouse, or children living with that spouse, and




(i)

the worker and dependent spouse were living separate and apart for
a period of less than 3 months preceding the date of death of the
worker, compensation is payable as provided in subsection (3); or




(ii)

the worker and dependent spouse were separated with the intention
of living separate and apart for a period of 3 months or longer
preceding the death of the worker, monthly payments must be made
up to the level of support which the Board believes the spouse and
those children would have been likely to receive from the worker
if the death had not occurred.




(10)

Compensation payable under subsection (9) must never exceed the
compensation that would have been payable under subsection (3) if
there had been no separation.




(11)

Compensation under this section is payable to a surviving spouse
described in paragraph (b) of the definition of "spouse" only if a
worker was living with and contributing to the support and
maintenance of the spouse immediately preceding the worker's
death.




(12)

If




(a)

a worker has left both




(i)

a dependent surviving spouse described in paragraph (a) of the
definition of "spouse" from whom, at the date of death, the worker
was living separate and apart, and




(ii)

a surviving spouse described in paragraph (b) of the definition of
"spouse", with whom the worker was living, and to whose support
and maintenance the worker was contributing, immediately preceding
the worker's death, and




(b)

there is a difference in




(i)

the amount of compensation payable to the spouse referred to in
paragraph (a) (i) of this subsection by reason of the separation,
and




(ii)

the amount of compensation that would have been payable to that
person if that person and the worker had not been living separate
and apart,


the Board may pay compensation, up to the amount of the
difference, to the spouse referred to in paragraph (a) (ii) of
this subsection.




(13)

In addition to any other compensation provided, a dependent
surviving spouse, common law spouse or foster parent in Canada to
whom compensation is payable is entitled to a lump sum of
$2 856.72
.

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]





(14)

Where in any situation there is a need to apportion allowances
payable to dependants among those dependants, the formula for
apportionment must be at the discretion of the Board; but, unless
the Board has grounds for a different apportionment, the
apportionment must be:




(a)

where there is a dependent spouse and one child, 2/3 to the
dependent spouse and 1/3 to the child;




(b)

where there is a dependent spouse and more than one child, 1/2 to
the dependent spouse and 1/2 among the children in equal shares;
and




(c)

where there are children but no dependent spouse, among the
children in equal shares.




(15)

Where personal injury to, disablement of or death of a worker
occurs in the course of the worker's employment as a direct result
of enemy warlike action or counteraction taken against it and
provision has been made for compensation in respect of it for the
worker or the worker's dependants by the government of Canada, the
worker or the dependants are entitled to compensation under this
Part only when the compensation provided by the government of
Canada is less than that provided by this Act, and then only to
the extent of the difference.




(16)

If a dependant is entitled to receive compensation




(a)

as a result of the death of a worker, and




(b)

as a result of the subsequent death of another worker,


the total compensation payable for the dependant as a result of
those deaths is an amount that the Board considers appropriate.




(16.1)

The compensation payable for a dependant under subsection (16)
must not




(a)

be less than the highest of the amounts that would otherwise be
payable in respect of the death of any of the workers, and




(b)

be more than 90% of the average net earnings of a worker whose
wage rate is the maximum wage rate established under section 33
(6) and (7) for the year in which the last death referred to in
subsection (16) (b) occurred.




(16.2)

For the purposes of subsection (16.1),
"average net earnings"
means the average net earnings calculated in accordance with
section 33.8.




(17)

Where a situation arises that is not expressly covered by this
section, or where some special additional facts are present that
would, in the Board's opinion, make the strict application of this
section inappropriate, the Board must make rules and give
decisions it considers fair, using this section as a guideline.

benefits under the Canada Pension Plan, and where the amount of
benefits under the Canada Pension Plan is less than the amounts
set out in subsection (1), the monthly payments payable to those
dependants under this Part must be increased by the amount by
which the benefits under the Canada Pension Plan are less.

(1)


In this subsection and subsections (2) and (2.1)



"former subsection"

means the section 19 (1) that came into force on April 17, 1985 or
the section 19 (4) repealed in 1994;


"interest"
means interest calculated at a rate and in a manner set by the

(2)

A person whose monthly payments were discontinued by application
of a former subsection is entitled to




(a)

monthly payments beginning on the later of




(i)

the expiry of the 2 year period for which payment was made under
the former subsection, or




(ii)

the repeal of the former subsection,




(b)

the amount, if any, by which, during the period from April 17,
1985 to the beginning of monthly payments under paragraph (a), the
total amount of compensation described by section 17 that the
person would have received if the former subsection had not been
in force exceeds the sum paid to the person under the former
subsection, and




(c)

Period for making payments under sections 17 to 19




19.1


The Board must make periodic payments under section 17, 18 or 19
for the life of the person to whom the payment is to be made,
unless a shorter period applies under section 17, 18 or 19, as the
case may be.






Proof of existence of dependants




20


The Board may from time to time require the proof of the existence
and condition of dependants in receipt of compensation payments
that is deemed necessary by the Board, and pending the receipt of
that proof may withhold further payments.






Health care




21

(1)


In addition to the other compensation provided by this Part, the
Board may furnish or provide for the injured worker any medical,
surgical, hospital, nursing and other care or treatment,
transportation, medicines, crutches and apparatus, including
artificial members, that it may consider reasonably necessary at
the time of the injury, and thereafter during the disability to
cure and relieve from the effects of the injury or alleviate those
effects, and the Board may adopt rules and regulations with
respect to furnishing health care to injured workers entitled to
it and for the payment of it. The Board may make a daily allowance
to an injured worker for the worker's subsistence when, under its
direction, the worker is undergoing treatment at a place other
than the place where he or she resides, and the power of the Board
to make a daily allowance for subsistence under this section
extends to an injured worker who receives compensation, regardless
of the date the worker first became entitled to compensation.




(2)

Where in a case of emergency, or for other justifiable cause, a
physician or qualified practitioner other than the one provided by
the Board is called in to treat the injured worker, and if the
Board finds there was a justifiable cause and that the charge for
the services is reasonable, the cost of the services must be paid
by the Board.




(3)

The Board may in its discretion authorize employers to furnish or
provide health care at the expense of the Board and on terms fixed
by it. Every employer must, at the employer's own expense, furnish
to a worker injured in the employer's employment, when necessary,
immediate conveyance and transportation to a hospital, physician
or qualified practitioner for initial treatment.




(4)

Where a worker received, before April 1, 1972, health care under




(a)

the
Canada Shipping Act
; or




(b)

a health care plan approved by the Board,


the worker is entitled to receive, in accordance with this
section, additional health care.




(5)

Where additional health care is provided by the Board under
subsection (4), its cost may be charged in the manner the Board
considers proper.




(6)

Health care furnished or provided under any of the preceding
subsections of this section must at all times be subject to the
direction, supervision and control of the Board; and the Board may
contract with physicians, nurses or other persons authorized to
treat human ailments, hospitals and other institutions for any
health care required, and to agree on a scale of fees or
remuneration for that health care; and all questions as to the
necessity, character and sufficiency of health care to be
furnished must be determined by the Board. The fees or
remuneration for health care furnished under this Act must not be
more than would be properly and reasonably charged the worker if
the worker were paying, and the amount must be fixed and
determined by the Board, and no action for an amount larger than
that fixed by the Board lies in respect of health care.




(7)

Without limiting the power of the Board under this section to
supervise and provide for the furnishing of health care in every
case where it considers the exercise of that power is expedient,
the Board must permit health care to be administered, so far as
the selection of a physician or qualified practitioner is
concerned, by the physician or qualified practitioner who may be
selected or employed by the injured worker.




(8)

The Board may assume the responsibility of replacement and repair
of




(a)

artificial appliances, including artificial members damaged or
broken as the result of an accident arising out of and in the
course of the employment of the worker; and




(b)

eyeglasses, dentures and hearing aids broken as a result of an
accident arising out of and in the course of employment if that
breakage is accompanied by objective signs of personal injury, or,
where there is no personal injury, if the accident is otherwise
corroborated and the Board is satisfied the worker was not at
fault.




(9)

Where an injury to a worker results in serious impairment of the
worker's sight, the Board may, to protect the worker's remaining
vision, provide the worker with protective eyeglasses.






Permanent total disability




22

(1)


Subject to sections 34 and 35, if a permanent total disability
results from a worker's injury, the Board must pay the worker
compensation that is a periodic payment that equals 90% of the
worker's average net earnings.




(2)

The compensation awarded under this section must not be less than
$1 835.64
per month.

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]







Permanent partial disability or disfigurement




23

(1)


Subject to subsections (3) to (3.2) and sections 34 and 35, if a
permanent partial disability results from a worker's injury, the
Board must




(a)

estimate the impairment of earning capacity from the nature and
degree of the injury, and




(b)

pay the worker compensation that is a periodic payment that equals
90% of the Board's estimate of the loss of average net earnings
resulting from the impairment.




(2)

The Board may compile a rating schedule of percentages of
impairment of earning capacity for specified injuries or
mutilations which may be used as a guide in determining the
compensation payable in permanent disability cases.




(3)

Subject to sections 34 and 35, if




(a)

a permanent partial disability results from a worker's injury, and




(b)

the Board makes a determination under subsection (3.1) with
respect to the worker,


the Board may pay the worker compensation that is a periodic
payment that equals 90% of the difference between




(c)

the average net earnings of the worker before the injury, and




(d)

whichever of the following amounts the Board considers better
represents the worker's loss of earnings:




(i)

the average net earnings that the worker is earning after the
injury;




(ii)

the average net earnings that the Board estimates the worker is
capable of earning in a suitable occupation after the injury.




(3.1)

A payment may be made under subsection (3) only if the Board
determines that the combined effect of the worker's occupation at
the time of the injury and the worker's disability resulting from
the injury is so exceptional that an amount determined under
subsection (1) does not appropriately compensate the worker for
the injury.




(3.2)

In making a determination under subsection (3.1), the Board must
consider the ability of the worker to continue in the worker's
occupation at the time of the injury or to adapt to another
suitable occupation.




(4)

Where permanent partial disability results from the injury, the
minimum compensation awarded under this section must be calculated
in the same manner as provided by section 29 (2) for temporary
total disability but to the extent only of the partial disability.




(5)

Where the worker has suffered a serious and permanent
disfigurement which the Board considers is capable of impairing
the worker's earning capacity, a lump sum in compensation may be
paid, although the amount the worker was earning before the injury
has not been diminished.






Period of payment for total or partial disability




23.1


Compensation payable under section 22 (1), 23 (1) or (3), 29 (1)
or 30 (1) may be paid to a worker, only




(a)

if the worker is less than 63 years of age on the date of the
injury, until the later of the following:




(i)

the date the worker reaches 65 years of age;




(ii)

if the Board is satisfied the worker would retire after reaching
65 years of age, the date the worker would retire, as determined
by the Board, and




(b)

if the worker is 63 years of age or older on the date of the
injury, until the later of the following:




(i)

2 years after the date of the injury;




(ii)

if the Board is satisfied that the worker would retire after the
date referred to in subparagraph (i), the date the worker would
retire, as determined by the Board.






Retirement benefits




23.2

(1)


This section applies to a worker who is receiving periodic
payments under section 22 (1) or 23 (1) or (3).




(2)

The Board must set aside, at the time a periodic payment is made
to a worker, an amount that




(a)

is equal to 5% of the periodic payment, and




(b)

is in addition to the periodic payment.




(3)

A worker may apply to the Board to contribute to the amount set
aside or to be set aside under subsection (2) an amount that is
not less than 1% and not greater than 5% of each subsequent
periodic payment made to the worker.




(4)

Subject to subsection (5), if the worker makes an application
under subsection (3), the Board must, as soon as practicable,
deduct the amount of the worker's contribution from each
subsequent periodic payment made to the worker and add this
contribution to the amount set aside under subsection (2).




(5)

The deductions made by the Board under subsection (4) may not be
varied, except in response to an application by the worker to stop
the deductions.




(6)

A worker may only once




(a)

make an application under subsection (3), and




(b)

apply to stop the deductions.




(7)

An application made under subsection (3) or (5) must be made in a
form acceptable to the Board.




(8)

The Board must provide each worker annually with a statement
containing all relevant information about the funds accumulated by
the Board for payment of the worker's retirement benefit.






Payment of retirement benefits




23.3

(1)


Subject to subsection (3), on the date determined under subsection
(2), a worker is entitled to receive a lump sum that equals the
total of




(a)

the amounts set aside for payment to the worker under section 23.2
(2),




(b)

the contributions, if any, made by the worker under section 23.2
(4), and




(c)

the accumulated investment income earned on those amounts and
contributions.




(2)

A worker's entitlement under subsection (1) is effective




(a)

subject to paragraph (b), on the date the worker reaches 65 years
of age, or




(b)

on the date of the last periodic payment to the worker, if that
date is after the date the worker reaches 65 years of age.




(3)

Despite section 35 (4), if a worker dies before receiving his or
her retirement benefit under subsection (1), the Board must pay
the lump sum to which the worker is entitled under that subsection
to




(a)

a beneficiary designated by the worker, or




(b)

the worker's estate, if a beneficiary is not designated.






Handling of money to be paid as retirement benefit




23.4

(1)


The Board must establish a reserve in the accident fund into which
the amounts and contributions referred to in section 23.2 (2) and
(4) must be deposited.




(2)

The funds deposited in the reserve must be held and invested in
the name of the reserve and those investments must clearly
indicate that they are held in that reserve for payment of
retirement benefits under section 23.3.




(3)

If approved by the board of directors and on terms set by the
Board, the Board may authorize a financial institution, as defined
in the
Financial Institutions Act
, or a bank to administer the reserve referred to in subsection
(1), and a financial institution or bank that is so authorized
must comply with the relevant provisions of this Part as if it
were the Board.






Retirement services and supports




23.5

(1)


If a worker has a permanent total disability, the Board must
assess, within the 3 month period before the retirement benefit is
payable to the worker, the need or continued need of the worker
for services and personal supports under sections 16 and 21.




(2)

After the assessment under subsection (1) is completed, the Board
must take all actions necessary to provide to the worker, for his
or her life, the services and personal supports under sections 16
and 21 that the Board considers are necessary.




(3)

This section does not limit the power of the Board to otherwise
provide services and personal supports to workers at any time
under sections 16 and 21.






Reconsidering benefits




24

(1)


Despite section 96 (1), this section applies to the claims for
compensation that the Board may by regulation determine, provided
that




(a)

the worker is still suffering from a compensable disability
sustained more than 10 years before the application under
subsection (2); and




(b)

a permanent disability award was made by the Board based on a
percentage of total disability of 12% or greater, or the case is
of a kind in which the Board uses a projected loss of earnings
method in calculating compensation.




(2)

With respect to a claim for compensation to which this section
applies, the Board must, on application by the worker, reconsider
the compensation benefits; and, if it decides that, in its
opinion, the worker is not receiving adequate compensation having
regard to the projected loss of income resulting from the
disability, periodic payments must be established or raised
accordingly.




(3)

Where a worker is under the age of 65 years, compensation is
considered adequate for the purposes of this section if it equals
75% of the projected loss of earnings resulting from the
disability.




(4)

Where a worker is 65 years of age or over, compensation is
considered adequate for the purposes of this section if it equals
75% of the projected loss of retirement income resulting from the
disability.




(5)

Where a worker is under the age of 65 years, periodic payments
established or raised under this section are subject to
readjustment by reference to subsection (4) on attaining the age
of 65 years.




(6)

The calculation of benefits under this section must be made in the
manner the Board determines.




(7)

Notwithstanding that a worker suffering a permanent disability has
received an award that has been wholly or partly commuted, or an
award for a fixed term, the worker may apply under this section,
but the worker is deemed to be still receiving the periodic
payments that have been commuted, or the life equivalent of the
periodic payments made for a fixed term.




(8)

Section 31 applies to the calculation of compensation under this
section; but the calculation must not be limited by reference to
average earnings at the time of injury.




(9)

The periodic payments awarded to a worker following a
reconsideration under this section must not exceed the maximum the
Board would award to a worker in an occupational category similar
to the occupation of the applicant worker before the injury if he
or she had, at the effective date of the reconsideration under
this section, suffered a compensable disability similar to the
compensable disability being suffered by the applicant worker.




(10)

A worker may reapply under this section for reconsideration of his
or her compensation benefits after a further 10 years have elapsed
since the last previous application under this section.




(11)

Where a worker whose disability occurred before January 1, 1965
applies under this section within one year of the earliest date on
which the worker becomes eligible to do so, an increase or
establishment of benefits under this section is effective from
September 1, 1975, and in all other cases the effective date for
the commencement of an increase or establishment of benefits under
this section is the date the application is received at the Board.




(12)

A decision under this section must not result in periodic payments
to a worker being lower than they would be if no application had
ever been made under this section.






General indexing factor




25

(1)


For the purposes of this section, the Board must, as of January 1
of each year,




(a)

determine the percentage change in the consumer price index for
Canada, for all items, for the 12 month period ending on October
31 of the previous year, as published by Statistics Canada, and




(b)

subtract 1% from the percentage change determined under paragraph
(a).




(2)

The percentage resulting from calculations made under subsection
(1) must not be greater than 4% or less than 0%.




(3)

On January 1 of each year, the Board must adjust, in accordance
with subsection (4), the periodic payments of compensation made in
respect of an injury or a death occurring more than 12 months
before the date of the adjustment.




(4)

For the purposes of subsection (3), the Board must adjust the
periodic payments of compensation to be paid in that calendar year
for the injury or death by the percentage determined under
subsection (1).




(5)

If the Board starts or restarts periodic payments of compensation
for an injury or a death that occurred more than 12 months before
the payments are started or restarted, the Board must, under this
section, adjust all periodic payments as if the payments were made
continuously from the date of injury or death.






Repealed

[Repealed 2003-65-19.]






Variation of dollar amounts




25.2

(1)


Subject to subsection (3), the Board must adjust every dollar
amount referred to in this Act on January 1 of each year by
applying the percentage change in the consumer price index for
Canada, for all items, for the 12 month period ending on October
31 of the previous year, as published by Statistics Canada.




(2)

On the Board making an adjustment of a dollar amount under
subsection (1), the dollar amount referred to in this Act is
deemed to be amended.



[Note: For convenience, orders made under this section are
reprinted at the end of this Act.]

section 33 (4), (6), (8) and (10).






Repealed




25.3


[Repealed 2003-65-21.]






Transitional




26

(1)


Where periodical payments for permanent disability were awarded by
the Board prior to January 1, 1966, and where




(a)

the award was for a percentage of total disability of 12% or
greater, and the whole of the periodical payments was commuted
prior to that date;




(b)

a portion of the periodical payments equivalent to 12% of total
disability or greater was commuted prior to that date; or




(c)

the award was for a percentage of total disability of 12% or
greater and was of periodical payments for a fixed term,


and where the worker to whom the award had been made is still
suffering from the disability, the Board may, on the application
of the worker, establish new periodic payments, which are to
commence for the month in which the application is received at the
Board.




(2)

Where the award was for a fixed term that has not expired or been
commuted, this section applies on expiry of the term.




(3)

In order to calculate the rate of new periodic payments to be
established under this section, the Board must determine




(a)

the monthly payments that would have been payable on January 1,
1966 if the award had been of periodic payments for life and there
had been no commutation, or, where the commutation was partial,
the additional rate of monthly payments that would have been
payable on that date if there had been no commutation; and




(b)

the additional amount of monthly payments that would have been
payable for the month during which the application is received by
way of increases on the amounts calculated under paragraph (a) if
those amounts had continued to be due; namely, the total of all
increases that would have been made from January 1, 1966 to and
including the last day of the month preceding the date the
application is received.




(4)

The rate of the new periodical payments to be established under
this section must be the amount calculated under subsection (3)
(b); but future adjustments under section 25 must be based on the
sum of the amounts calculated under subsection (3) (a) and (b).




(5)

This section does not apply where the purpose of the section has
been achieved as a result of an application under section 24 or in
some other way.






Transitional




27


Where dependants are receiving or are eligible to receive periodic
payments in respect of the death of a worker occurring prior to
July 1, 1974, and in respect of which payments there was no
provision prior to that date for increases according to the
consumer price index, those periodical payments must be adjusted
as of August 1, 1975, so that after that date the periodical
payments will be at the same rate as if the provisions of the Act
relating to increases according to the consumer price index
between January 1, 1966 and July 1, 1974 had been applicable.






Publish in Gazette




28


There must be published in the Gazette amendments to the Act
resulting from changes in the consumer price index.






Temporary total disability




29

(1)


Subject to sections 34 (1) and 35 (1), (4) and (5), if a temporary
total disability results from a worker's injury, the Board must
pay the worker compensation that is a periodic payment that equals
90% of the worker's average net earnings.




(2)

The compensation awarded under this section must not be less than
an amount equal to
$423.54
per week, unless the worker's average earnings are less than that
sum per week, in which case the worker must receive compensation
in an amount equal to the worker's average earnings.

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]







Temporary partial disability




30

(1)


Subject to sections 34 (1) and 35 (1), (4) and (5), if a temporary
partial disability results from a worker's injury, the Board must
pay the worker compensation that is a periodic payment that equals
90% of the difference between




(a)

the worker's average net earnings before the injury, and




(b)

whichever of the following amounts the Board considers better
represents the worker's loss of earnings:




(i)

the average net earnings that the worker is earning after the
injury;




(ii)

the average net earnings that the Board estimates the worker is
capable of earning in a suitable occupation after the injury.




(2)

Where temporary partial disability results from the injury, the
minimum compensation awarded under this section must be calculated
in the same manner as prescribed by section 29 (2) for temporary
total disability but to the extent only of the partial disability.






Maximum compensation




31

(1)


Where a worker is receiving compensation for a permanent or
temporary disability, the worker must not receive compensation for
a further or other disability in an amount that would result in
the worker receiving in the aggregate compensation in excess of
the maximum payable for total disability.




(2)

Where a worker has received a lump sum in lieu of the periodic
payments that otherwise would have been payable for a permanent
disability, the worker is, for the purposes of subsection (1),
deemed to be still in receipt of the periodic payments.






Termination of periodic payments




31.1


Despite section 23.1, the Board may not make a periodic payment to
a worker under section 22 (1), 23 (1) or (3), 29 (1) or 30 (1) if
the worker ceases to have the disability for which the periodic
payment is to be made.






Recurrence of disability




32

(1)


For the purpose of determining the amount of compensation payable
where there is a recurrence of temporary total disability or
temporary partial disability after a lapse of 3 years following
the occurrence of the injury, the Board may calculate the
compensation as if the recurrence were the happening of the injury
if it considers that by doing so the compensation payable would
more nearly represent the percentage of actual loss of earnings
suffered by the worker by reason of the recurrence of the injury.




(2)

Where a worker has been awarded compensation for permanent partial
disability for the original injury and compensation for recurrence
of temporary total disability under subsection (1) is calculated
by reference to the average earnings of the worker at the date of
the recurrence, the compensation must be without deduction of the
compensation payable for the permanent partial disability; but the
total compensation payable must not exceed the maximum payable
under this Part at the date of the recurrence.




(3)

Where more than 3 years after an injury a permanent disability or
an increased degree of permanent disability occurs, the
compensation payable for the permanent disability or increased
degree of permanent disability may be calculated by reference to
the average earnings of the worker at the date of the occurrence
of the permanent disability or increased degree of permanent
disability.






Average earnings




33

(1)


The Board must determine the amount of average earnings and the
earning capacity of a worker with reference to the worker's
average earnings and earning capacity at the time of the worker's
injury.




(2)

Subject to section 3 (5), the Board must determine the amount of
average earnings of a worker in accordance with this section and
sections 33.1 to 33.7.




(3)

A determination of the amount of average earnings of a worker
under sections 33.1 to 33.7 may not exceed the maximum wage rate
as determined under subsections (6) to (10).




(3.1)

The Board must not include the following in determining the amount
of average earnings of a worker:




(a)

the employer's payments on behalf of the worker for




(i)

contributions payable under the
Canada Pension Plan
,




(ii)

premiums payable under the
Employment Insurance Act
(Canada), and




(iii)

contributions to a retirement, pension, health and welfare, life
insurance or another benefit plan for the worker or the worker's
dependants;




(b)

special expenses or allowances paid to the worker because of the
nature of the worker's employment.




(3.2)

The Board may include, in determining the amount of average
earnings of a worker, income from employment benefits payable to
the worker under the
Employment Insurance Act
(Canada) during the period for which average earnings are
determined, only if, in the Board's opinion, the worker's
employment during that period was in an occupation or industry
that results in recurring seasonal or recurring temporary
interruptions of employment.




(4)

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, all periodic
payments awarded as compensation for permanent partial disability
to workers injured prior to March 18, 1943, who, on January 1,
1955, or after that are in receipt of those periodical payments
must be calculated or recalculated at a rate of 66 2/3% of average
earnings of not less than $2 000 nor more than $2 500 per annum;
but compensation is not payable under this subsection for a period
prior to January 1, 1955.




(5)

The compensation payable to workers who, on July 1, 1974, are in
receipt of compensation for permanent total disability must not be
less than
$1 835.64
per month.

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning dollar amount.]





(6)

Until changed under subsection (7), the maximum wage rate under
subsection (1) is $11 200 per year.
[Note: See subsection (10).]




(7)

Prior to the end of each calendar year, the Board must determine
the maximum wage rate to be applicable for the following calendar
year.




(8)

The maximum wage rate to be determined under subsection (7) must
be an amount that the Board thinks represents the same
relationship to the sum of $11 200 as the annual average of wages
and salaries in the Province for the year preceding that in which
the determination is made bears to the annual average of wages and
salaries for the year 1972; and the resulting figure may be
rounded to the nearest $100.
[Note: See subsection (10).]




(9)

For the purpose of determining annual average of wages and
salaries under subsection (8), the Board may use data published or
supplied by Statistics Canada.




(10)

Where a worker is injured after December 31, 1985, the references
in subsections (6) and (8) to $11 200 must be read as references
to $40 000, and the reference in subsection (8) to 1972 must be
read as a reference to 1984.

[Note: See Note on page 1 of the Act concerning maximum wage
rate.]







General rule for determination of average earnings




33.1

(1)


Subject to sections 33.5 to 33.7, the Board must determine, for
the shorter of the following periods, the amount of average
earnings of a worker based on the rate at which the worker was
remunerated by each of the employers for whom he or she was
employed at the time of the injury:




(a)

the initial payment period;




(b)

the period starting on the date of the worker's injury and ending
on the date the worker's injury results in a permanent disability,

(2)




33.6


If an independent operator or employer, to whom the Board directs
that this Part applies under section 2 (2), has purchased coverage

consideration must be had to payments, allowances or benefits
which the worker may receive from the worker's employer during the
period of the disability, including a pension, gratuity or other
allowance provided wholly at the expense of the employer, and a
sum deducted under this section from the compensation otherwise
payable may be paid to the employer out of the accident fund.




(2)

Subject to sections 7 (4.1), 22 (2) and 23 (4), the Board must
deduct, from the amount of a periodic payment of compensation paid
to a worker under section 22 (1) or 23 (1) or (3) for an injury,

the deceased.




(5)

the worker to the extent the worker is able to make use of the
money for his or her personal needs or is able to manage his or
her own affairs; or

assessment in order to maintain the accident fund:




Class 1:
Primary resource


Class 2:

create new classes in addition to those referred to in subsection
(1);




(b)

divide classes into subclasses and divide subclasses into further
subclasses;




(c)

consolidate or rearrange any existing classes and subclasses;




(d)

assign an employer, independent operator or industry to one or
more classes or subclasses;




(e)

withdraw from a class




(i)

an employer, independent operator or industry,




(ii)

a part of the class, or




(iii)

a subclass or part of a subclass,


and transfer it to another class or subclass or form it into a
separate class or subclass;




(f)

of the classes and subclasses affected that the Board considers
just and expedient.




(4)

Without limiting subsection (2) or (3), for the purposes of
transition in relation to the classes established by subsection
(1) as enacted by section 31 of the
Labour Statutes Amendment Act, 1999
, the Board may




(a)

assign or reassign employers, independent operators or industries
to those classes as the Board considers advisable, and




(b)

make the adjustment and disposition of the funds, reserves and
accounts of the pre-existing classes that the Board considers
advisable.






Employer to furnish estimate of payrolls




38

(1)


Every employer must




(a)

keep at all times at some place in the Province, the location of
which the employer has given notice to the Board, complete and
accurate particulars of the employer's payrolls;




(b)

cause to be furnished to the Board




(i)

when the employer becomes an employer within the scope of this
Part; and,




(ii)

at other times as required by a regulation of the Board of general
application or an order of the Board limited to a specific
employer,


an estimate of the probable amount of the payroll of each of the
employer's industries within the scope of this Part, together with
any further information required by the Board; and




(c)

furnish certified copies of reports of the employer's payrolls, at
or after the close of each calendar year and at the other times
and in the manner required by the Board.




(2)

Where the employer fails to comply with subsection (1), the
employer is liable to pay and must pay as a penalty for the
default a percentage of the assessment prescribed by the
regulations or determined by the Board, and the Board may make its
own estimate of the payrolls and may make its assessment and levy
on that estimate, and the employer is bound by it.




(3)

In computing the amount of the payroll for the purpose of
assessment, regard must be had only to that portion of the payroll
that represents workers and employment within the scope of this
Part. Where the wages of a worker exceed the maximum wage for one
year as fixed for the time being under section 33, a deduction may
be made where practical in respect of the excess; and where the
wages of a worker are shown to exceed the above maximum wage rate,
the Board may make a deduction where practical in respect of the
portion in excess of that rate; and where a worker within the
scope of this Part works at a nominal wage or no wage, the amount
of the worker's average earnings for purposes of this Part may be
fixed by the Board.




(4)

If an employer does not comply with subsection (1), or if a
statement made in pursuance of its requirements is not true and
accurate, the employer, for every failure to comply and for every
such statement, commits an offence against this Part.






Assessment for accident fund




39

(1)


For the purpose of creating and maintaining an adequate accident
fund, the Board must every year assess and levy on and collect
from independent operators and employers in each class, by
assessment rated on the payroll, or by assessment rated on a unit
of production, or in a manner the Board considers proper,
sufficient funds, according to an estimate to be made by the Board
to




(a)

meet all amounts payable from the accident fund during the year;




(b)

provide a reserve in aid of industries or classes which may become
depleted or extinguished;




(c)

provide in each year capitalized reserves sufficient to meet the
periodical payments of compensation accruing in future years in
respect of all injuries which occur during the year;




(d)

provide a reserve to be used to meet the loss arising from a
disaster or other circumstance which the Board considers would
unfairly burden the employers in a class;




(e)

provide and maintain a reserve for payment of that portion of the
disability enhanced by reason of a pre-existing disease, condition
or disability; and




(f)

provide and maintain a reserve for payment of retirement benefits.




(2)

Assessments may be made in the manner and form and by the
procedure the Board considers adequate and expedient, and may be
general as applicable to a class or subclass, or special as
applicable to an industry or part or department of it.




(3)

Assessments may, wherever it is considered expedient, be collected
in half yearly, quarterly or monthly instalments, or otherwise;
and where it appears that the funds in a class are sufficient for
the time being, an instalment may be abated or its collection
deferred.




(4)

If the Board thinks that there are not sufficient funds to provide
the compensation or additional compensation required to be paid
under this Part, it may levy and collect from employers within the
scope of this Part sufficient funds for this purpose without
regard to the date of injury or the period during which the
employer carried on an industry under this Part; and the levy and
collection may be made in the manner and at the times the Board
considers equitable, and may be by way of addition to the usual
assessment or by levy of special or additional assessment.




(5)

If the estimated assessments in a class prove insufficient, the
Board may make further assessments and levies as necessary, or the
Board may temporarily advance the amount of a deficiency out of
any reserve provided for that purpose and add that amount to any
subsequent assessments.




(6)

The Board must notify each employer of the amount of each
assessment due in respect of the employer's industry and the time
when it is payable. The notice may be sent by post to the
employer, and is deemed to be given to the employer on the day the
notice is mailed.




(7)

If for any reason an employer liable to assessment is not assessed
in any year, the employer is nevertheless liable to pay the Board
the amount for which the employer should have been assessed, and
payment of that amount may be enforced in the same manner as the
payment of an assessment may be enforced.




(8)

If it is found, on an estimate made by the Board, that more than
sufficient funds have been provided for the purposes set out in
subsection (1) (a), (b), (d) and (e), the excess may be
transferred to the capitalized reserves.




(9)

Where special circumstances, including legislative change, result
in claims being made or liabilities being imposed on the accident
fund in excess of what the Board considers should reasonably be
funded by assessments levied during the current year, the Board
must raise sufficient funds by assessments during that year to
meet the estimated payments due within the year, but need not
establish within the year reserves to meet future payments on
those claims or liabilities, and the Board may establish those
reserves by assessments levied over a period of years.






Assessment by notice




40

(1)


Where the Board




(a)

notifies an employer of assessment rates or percentages determined
by the Board in respect of the industries in which the employer is
engaged; and




(b)

informs the employer of the manner in which the assessment is
calculated, and the date it is payable,


the notice constitutes an assessment under section 39, and the
employer must, within the time limited in the notice,




(c)

make a return on the form provided or prescribed by the Board; and




(d)

remit the amount of the assessment.




(2)

Every employer who neglects or refuses to comply with subsection
(1) is liable for the penalty prescribed by the regulations or
determined by the Board, and that penalty is enforceable as an
assessment under this Part.






Repealed




41


[Repealed 1993-34-7.]






Classification of rates




42


The Board must establish subclassifications, differentials and
proportions in the rates as between the different kinds of
employment in the same class as may be considered just; and where
the Board thinks a particular industry or plant is shown to be so
circumstanced or conducted that the hazard or cost of compensation
differs from the average of the class or subclass to which the
industry or plant is assigned, the Board must confer or impose on
that industry or plant a special rate, differential or assessment
to correspond with the relative hazard or cost of compensation of
that industry or plant, and for that purpose may also adopt a
system of experience rating.






Power to vary rates




43


The Board may, in a manner that it determines, vary the rates of
assessment as between different employers or levy supplementary
assessments according to the estimated exposure of workers to
industrial noise, and it may do so whether or not hearing
protection is worn.






Temporary industries




44

(1)


Where an employer engages in any industry within the scope of this
Part and has not been assessed in respect of it, the Board, if it
considers that the industry is to be carried on only temporarily,
may require the employer to pay or to give security for the
payment to the Board of a sum sufficient to pay the assessment for
which the employer would be liable if the industry had been in
existence when the last preceding assessment was made.




(2)

Every employer who makes default in complying with a requirement
of the Board under subsection (1) commits an offence against this
Part.






Collection of assessments by suit or summarily




45

(1)


If an assessment or part of it is not paid in accordance with the
terms of the assessment and levy, the Board has a right of action
against the defaulting employer in respect of the amount unpaid,
together with costs of the action.




(2)

Where default is made in the payment of an assessment, or part of
it, the Board may issue its certificate stating that the
assessment was made, the amount remaining unpaid on account of it
and the person by whom it was payable, and that certificate, or a
copy of it certified by the secretary under the seal of the Board
to be a true copy, may be filed with any district registrar of the
Supreme Court, and when so filed becomes an order of that court
and may be enforced as a judgment of the court against that person
for the amount mentioned in the certificate.






Power to restrain industry if employer defaults




46

(1)


The Supreme Court may make an order under subsection (2) if




(a)

an employer defaults in the payment of an assessment,




(b)

an execution, issued on a judgment entered with respect to the
assessment, is returned with a certificate from a sheriff or the
sheriff's deputy that he or she was unable wholly to satisfy the
execution, and




(c)

an industry, or an activity in an industry, within the scope of
this Part is commenced or continues to be carried on by one or
more of the following persons:

if the judgment debtor is a company, within the meaning of the
Business Corporations Act
, an individual who is a member of the board of directors of the
judgment debtor as a result of having been elected or appointed to
that position;




(iii)

if the judgment debtor is a corporation other than a company,

governing body of the judgment debtor, regardless of the title by
which that person is designated;

primarily for the purposes of the administration of the bankrupt's
estate, or




(D)

is a receiver, receiver manager or creditor who participates in

purposes of enforcing a debt obligation of the judgment debtor.




(2)

Court, on an application made on behalf of the Board, without the
commencement of an action, may make an order restraining one or
more persons described in subsection (1) (c) (i) to (viii) from
carrying on an industry, or an activity in an industry, within the
scope of this Part until the amount due on the execution, all the
assessments made by the Board and the costs of the application are
paid.






Penalty for default in payment or return




47

(1)


If an assessment levied under this Part is not paid at the time
when it becomes payable, the defaulting employer is liable to and
must pay as a penalty for the default the percentage on the amount
unpaid or the assessment for the preceding year, or the projected
assessment for the current year, that may be prescribed by the
regulations or determined by the Board, and the penalty may be
added to the amount of the assessment and become a part of it, and
where not added to the assessment must be enforced in the same
manner as the payment of an assessment is enforced.




(2)

An employer who refuses or neglects to make or transmit a payroll
return or other statement required to be furnished by the employer
under section 38 (1), or who refuses or neglects to pay an
assessment, or the provisional amount of an assessment, or an
instalment or part of it, must, in addition to any penalty or
other liability to which the employer may be subject, pay the
Board the full amount or capitalized value, as determined by the
Board, of the compensation payable in respect of any injury or
occupational disease to a worker in the employer's employ which
happens during the period of that default, and the payment of the
amount may be enforced in the same manner as the payment of an
assessment may be enforced.




(3)

The Board, if satisfied that the default was excusable, may in any
case relieve the employer in whole or in part from liability under
this section.






Class accounts




48

(1)


Separate accounts must be maintained of the amounts collected and
expended in respect of every class, reserve and special fund, but
the accident fund is, for the purpose of paying compensation, one
fund and indivisible.




(2)

If a deficit occurs in a class or subclass, the Board may charge
to that class or subclass interest on the amount of the deficit at
a rate that will reimburse the accident fund for any loss
sustained by reason of the deficit, and may apportion the amount
of the interest received and credit it to the class or subclass or
special fund from which money was advanced to meet the deficit.






Adjustment of assessments




49

(1)


As soon as practicable in each year the amount of the assessment
for the preceding calendar year must be adjusted on the estimated
requirements of the class and on the correctly ascertained payroll
of each industry, and the employer must promptly make up and pay
to the Board any deficiency, or the Board must refund to the
employer any surplus, or credit the surplus on the succeeding
assessment as the case may require. Where the ascertained payroll
exceeds the estimate of it on which the employer was assessed, or
where the employer remits less than the amount of the assessment
due to the Board, the Board may on the adjustment charge to that
employer interest on the amount of the deficiency in the
assessment at a rate that in its opinion will reimburse the
accident fund for any loss sustained by reason of the deficiency,
and the interest must be added to the amount of the deficiency and
becomes a part of it.




(2)

Where in an industry a change of ownership or employership has
occurred, the Board may levy any part of the deficiency or the
unpaid amount of the assessment on any of the successive owners or
employers, or pay or credit to any one or more of the owners the
surplus that the case requires, but as between or among the
successive owners the assessments in respect of the employment
are, in the absence of an agreement between the respective owners
or employers determining the same, apportionable, as nearly as may
be, in accordance with the proportions of the payrolls of the
respective periods of ownership or employership.






Collection from contractors




50


Where work within the scope of this Part is performed under
contract for a municipal corporation, or for a board or commission
having the management of any work or service operated for a
municipal corporation, an assessment in respect of the work may be
paid by the corporation, board or commission, as the case may be,
and the amount of the assessment may be deducted from money due
the contractor in respect of the work.






Contractor liability




51

(1)


Where work within the scope of this Part is undertaken for a
person by a contractor, both the contractor and the person for
whom the work is undertaken are liable for the amount of any
assessment in respect of it, and the assessment may be levied on
and collected from either of them, or partly from each; but in the
absence of a term in the contract to the contrary the contractor
is, as between the contractor and the person for whom the work is
performed, primarily liable for the amount of the assessment.




(2)

Where work within the scope of this Part is performed under
subcontract, both the contractor and the subcontractor are liable
for the amount of the assessments in respect of the work; and the
assessments may be levied on and collected from either, or partly
from each; but in the absence of a term in the subcontract to the
contrary the subcontractor is, as between the subcontractor and
the contractor, primarily liable for the assessments.




(3)

Where a contractor or subcontractor who is executing work in or
for the purposes of an industry within the scope of this Part
carried on by another person (in this subsection referred to as
the "principal") is not assessed with respect to the work so
executed, the workers of the contractor or subcontractor may, in
the discretion of the Board, be deemed workers of the principal
with respect to the industry so carried on by the principal.




(4)

For the purposes of this section, a person, contractor,
subcontractor or principal includes an employer within the scope
of Part 1.






Priority as to amounts due Board




52

(1)


Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, the amount
due by an employer to the Board, or where an assignment has been
made under subsection (4), its assignee, on an assessment made
under this Act, or in respect of an amount which the employer is
required to pay to the Board under this Act, or on a judgment for
it, constitutes a lien in favour of the Board or its assignee
payable in priority over all liens, charges or mortgages of every
person, whenever created or to be created, with respect to the
property or proceeds of property, real, personal or mixed, used in
or in connection with or produced in or by the industry with
respect to which the employer was assessed or the amount became
payable

, excepting liens for wages due to workers by their employer and
liens under section 50 (1) of the
Temporary Foreign Worker Protection Act
,

and the lien for the amount due the Board or its assignee
continues to be valid and in force with respect to each assessment
until the expiration of 5 years from the end of the calendar year
for which the assessment was levied.




(1.1)

The exception in subsection (1)

respecting liens for wages due to workers by their employer

does not apply in respect of a lien for wages that is, by section
87 (5) of the
Employment Standards Act
, postponed to a mortgage or debenture.





(
1.2
)



The exception in subsection (1) respecting liens under section
50 (1) of the
Temporary Foreign Worker Protection Act
does not apply in respect of a lien that is, by section 50 (4)
of the
Temporary Foreign Worker Protection Act
, postponed to a mortgage or debenture.





(2)

Where the employer is a corporation, the word
"property"
in subsection (1) includes the property of any director, manager
or other principal of the corporation where the property is used
in, or in connection with, the industry with respect to which the
employer was assessed or the amount became payable, or was so used
within the period in respect of which assessments are unpaid.




(3)

Without limiting subsection (1), the Board may enforce its lien by
proceedings under the
Court Order Enforcement Act
.




(4)

The Board may assign its lien rights to a person, contractor or
subcontractor who has fully discharged his or her liability for
the amount of an assessment under section 51 by payment of it.




Division 5 — Procedure and Miscellaneous





Worker's notification of injury




53

(1)


In every case of an injury or disabling occupational disease to a
worker in an industry within the scope of this Part, the worker,
or in case of death the dependant, must as soon as practicable
after the occurrence inform the employer by giving information of
the disease or injury to the superintendent, first aid attendant,
supervisor, agent in charge of the work where the injury occurred
or other appropriate representative of the employer, and the
information must include the name of the worker, the time and
place of the occurrence, and, in ordinary language, the nature and
cause of the disease or injury.




(2)

In the case of an occupational disease, the employer to be
informed of the death or disablement is the employer who last
employed the worker in the employment to the nature of which the
disease was due.




(3)

The worker must, if he or she is fit to do so and on request of
the employer, provide to the employer particulars of the injury or
occupational disease on a form prescribed by the Board and
supplied to the worker by the employer.




(4)

Failure to provide the information required by this section is a
bar to a claim for compensation under this Part, unless the Board
is satisfied that




(a)

the information, although imperfect in some respects, is
sufficient to describe the disease or injury suffered, and the
occasion of it;




(b)

the employer or the employer's representative had knowledge of it;
or




(c)

the employer has not been prejudiced, and the Board considers that
the interests of justice require that the claim be allowed.






Employer's notification of injury




54

(1)


Subject to subsection (6), an employer must report to the Board
within 3 days of its occurrence every injury to a worker that is
or is claimed to be one arising out of and in the course of
employment.




(2)

Subject to subsection (6), an employer must report to the Board,
within 3 days of receiving information under section 53, every
disabling occupational disease, or claim for or allegation of an
occupational disease.




(3)

An employer must report immediately to the Board and to its local
representative the death of a worker where the death is or is
claimed to be one arising out of and in the course of employment.




(4)

The report must be on the form prescribed by the Board and must
state




(a)

the name and address of the worker;




(b)

the time and place of the disease, injury or death;




(c)

the nature of the injury or alleged injury;




(d)

the name and address of any physician or qualified practitioner
who attended the worker; and




(e)

any other particulars required by the Board or by the regulations,


and may be made by mailing copies of the form addressed to the
Board at the address the Board prescribes.




(5)

The failure to make a report required by virtue of this section,
unless excused by the Board on the ground that the report for some
sufficient reason could not have been made, constitutes an offence
against this Part.




(6)

Without limiting in any way the authority of the Board under
section 75, the Board may by regulation




(a)

define and prescribe a category of minor injuries not required to
be reported under this section; and




(b)

define or vary the time at which the obligation to report under
this section commences.




(7)

Where a report required by this section is not received by the
Board within 7 days of an injury or death, or any other time
prescribed by regulation under subsection (6), the Board may make
an interim adjudication of the claim, and, where it allows the
claim on an interim basis, may commence the payment of
compensation in whole or in part.




(8)

Any compensation paid under subsection (7), until 3 days after
receipt by the Board of the report required by this section, may
be levied and collected from the employer by way of additional
assessment as a contribution to the accident fund, and payment may
be enforced in like manner as other assessments.




(9)

Where the Board is satisfied that the delay in reporting was
excusable, it may relieve the employer in whole or in part of the
additional assessment imposed under subsection (8).






Application for compensation




55

(1)


An application for compensation must be made on the form
prescribed by the Board or the regulations and must be signed by
the worker or dependant; but, where the Board is satisfied that
compensation is payable, it may be paid without an application.




(2)

Unless an application is filed, or an adjudication made, within
one year after the date of injury, death or disablement from
occupational disease, no compensation is payable, except as
provided in subsections (3), (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3).




(3)

If the Board is satisfied that there existed special circumstances
which precluded the filing of an application within one year after
the date referred to in subsection (2), the Board may pay the
compensation provided by this Part if the application is filed
within 3 years after that date.




(3.1)

The Board may pay the compensation provided by this Part for the
period commencing on the date the Board received the application
for compensation if




(a)

the Board is satisfied that special circumstances existed which
precluded the filing of an application within one year after the
date referred to in subsection (2), and




(b)

the application is filed more than 3 years after the date referred
to in subsection (2).




(3.2)

The Board may pay the compensation provided by this Part if




(a)

the application arises from death or disablement due to an
occupational disease,




(b)

sufficient medical or scientific evidence was not available on the
date referred to in subsection (2) for the Board to recognize the
disease as an occupational disease and this evidence became
available on a later date, and




(c)

the application is filed within 3 years after the date sufficient
medical or scientific evidence as determined by the Board became
available to the Board.




(3.3)

Despite section 96 (1), if, since July 1, 1974, the Board
considered an application under the equivalent of this section in
respect of death or disablement from occupational disease, the
Board may reconsider that application, but the Board must apply
subsection (3.2) of this section in that reconsideration.




(4)

This section applies to an injury or death occurring on or after
January 1, 1974 and to an occupational disease in respect of which
exposure to the cause of the occupational disease in the Province
did not terminate prior to that date.






Duty of physician or practitioner




56

(1)

required by the regulations or by the Board, but the first report
containing all information requested in it must be furnished to
the Board within 3 days after the date of his or her first
attendance on the worker;




(b)

to furnish a report within 3 days after the worker is, in the
opinion of the physician or qualified practitioner, able to resume
work and, if treatment is being continued after resumption of
work, to furnish further adequate reports;




(c)

if the physician is a specialist whose opinion is requested by the
attending physician, the worker or the Board, or if the physician
continues to treat the worker after being consulted as a
specialist, to furnish his or her first report to the Board within
3 days after completion of consultation; but if the specialist is
regularly treating the worker, the specialist must submit reports
as required in paragraphs (a) and (b); and




(d)

to give all reasonable and necessary information, advice and
assistance to the injured worker and the worker's dependants in
making application for compensation, and in furnishing in
connection with it the required certificates and proofs, without
charge to the worker.




(2)

Every physician or qualified practitioner who is authorized by
this Act to treat an injured worker is subject to like duties and
responsibilities, and any health care furnished by the physician
or qualified practitioner is subject to the direction, supervision
and control of the Board.




(3)

Unless the Board otherwise directs, an account for medical
services or health care must not be paid if it is submitted later
than 90 days from the date that




(a)

the last treatment was given; or




(b)

the physician or person furnishing the medical service was first
aware that the Board may be liable for his or her services,

whichever first occurs.



(4)

A physician, qualified practitioner or other person authorized to
render health care under this Part must confine his or her
treatment to injuries to the parts of the body he or she is
authorized to treat under the statute under which he or she is
permitted to practise, and the giving of any unauthorized
treatment is an offence against this Part.




(5)

A physician, qualified practitioner or other person who fails to
submit prompt, adequate and accurate reports and accounts as
required by this Act or the Board commits an offence against this
Part, and his or her right to be selected by a worker to render
health care may be cancelled by the Board, or he or she may be
suspended for a period to be determined by the Board. When the
right of a person to render health care is so cancelled or
suspended, the Board must notify the person of the cancellation or
suspension, and must likewise inform the governing body named in
the Act under which the person is authorized to treat human
ailments, and the person whose right to render health care is
cancelled or suspended must also notify injured workers who seek
treatment from the person of the cancellation or suspension.






Worker to submit to examination




57

(1)


The Board may require a worker who applies for or is in receipt of
compensation under this Part to be medically examined at a place
reasonably convenient for the worker. If the worker fails to
attend for the examination or obstructs the medical examiner, the
worker's right to compensation is suspended until the examination
has taken place, and no compensation is payable during the period
of suspension.




(2)

The Board may reduce or suspend compensation when the worker




(a)

persists in insanitary or injurious practices which tend to
imperil or retard his or her recovery; or

refuses to submit to medical or surgical treatment which the Board
considers, based on expert medical or surgical advice, is
reasonably essential to promote his or her recovery.

negligence of the employer or of a person in the service of the
employer acting within the scope of his or her employment, the
worker, or, if the injury results in death, the legal personal
representatives of the worker, and any person entitled in case of
death has an action against the employer. If the action is brought

the person for whom the work or any part of it is done, or of some
person in his or her service and acting within the scope of his or
her employment, the person for whom the work or that part of the

subcontractor as between themselves.

A worker is not, by reason only of continuing in the employment of
the employer with knowledge of the defect or negligence which
caused his or her injury, deemed to have voluntarily incurred the
risk of injury.






Common law rules abrogated




104


A worker is deemed not to have undertaken the risks due to the
negligence of his or her fellow workers, and contributory
negligence on the part of a worker is not a bar to recovery by the
worker or by any person entitled to damages under the
Family Compensation Act
in an action for the recovery of damages for an injury sustained
by or causing the death of the worker while in the service of his
or her employer for which the employer would otherwise have been
liable.






Contributory negligence to be considered




105


Contributory negligence on the part of the worker must
nevertheless be taken into account in assessing the damages in an
action.

the employees of the employer;




(i)

request any person or representative group to participate in an
appeal if the tribunal considers that this participation will
assist the tribunal to fully consider the merits of the appeal.




(3)

If, in an appeal, the appeal tribunal considers there to be a
matter that should have been determined but that was not
determined by the Board, the appeal tribunal may refer that matter
back to the Board for determination and suspend the appeal
proceedings until the Board provides the appeal tribunal with that
determination.




(4)

If the appeal tribunal refers a matter back to the Board for
determination under subsection (3), the appeal tribunal must
consider the Board's determination in the context of the appeal
and no review of that determination may be requested under section
96.2.




(5)

If a party fails to comply with an order of the appeal tribunal or
with the rules of practice and procedure of the appeal tribunal,
including any time limits specified for taking any actions, after
giving notice to that party the appeal tribunal may do one or more

(b)

continue with the appeal and make a decision based on the evidence
before it, with or without providing an opportunity for
submissions;




(c)

Evidence admissible in appeal tribunal proceedings




246.1

The appeal tribunal may receive and accept information that it
considers relevant, necessary and appropriate, whether or not the
information would be admissible in a court of law.




(2)

Despite subsection (1), the appeal tribunal may exclude anything
unduly repetitious.




(3)

Nothing is admissible before the appeal tribunal that is
inadmissible in a court because of a privilege under the law of
evidence.




(4)

Nothing in subsection (1) overrides the provisions of any Act
expressly limiting the extent to or purposes for which any oral
testimony, documents or things may be admitted or used in
evidence.




(5)

Notes or records kept by a person appointed by the appeal tribunal
to conduct a dispute resolution process in relation to an appeal
are inadmissible in appeal tribunal proceedings.






Witnesses




247

(1)


At any time before or during a hearing, but before its decision,
the appeal tribunal may make an order requiring a person




(a)

to attend an oral or electronic hearing to give evidence on oath
or affirmation or in any other manner that is admissible and
relevant to an issue in an appeal, or




(b)

to produce for the appeal tribunal or a party a document or other
thing in the person's possession or control, as specified by the
appeal tribunal, that is admissible and relevant to an issue in an
appeal.




(1.1)

The appeal tribunal may apply to the Supreme Court for an order

person to comply with an order made by the appeal tribunal under
subsection (1).




(2)

On an appeal, the appeal tribunal may cause depositions of
witnesses residing in or out of the Province to be taken before a
person appointed by the appeal tribunal in a similar manner to
that prescribed by the Supreme Court Civil Rules for the taking of
like depositions in the Supreme Court before a commissioner.




(3)

Despite subsections (1) to (2), an officer, an employee or a
contractor of the Board may only be compelled to give evidence or
produce books, papers, documents and things that




(a)

relate to the issues in a specific appeal, and




(b)

are necessary for the appeal tribunal to address those issues and
to make a decision in the appeal.




(4)

Despite subsections (1) to (2), a member of the board of directors
or an officer, an employee or a contractor of the Board may not be
compelled to give evidence or produce books, papers, documents and
things respecting the development or adoption of the policies of
the board of directors.






Deemed employer




248

(1)


Subject to subsections (2) and (3), for the purposes of a specific
appeal, if the employer has ceased to be an employer within the
meaning of Part 1, the appeal tribunal may deem an employers'
adviser within the meaning of section 94 or an organized group of
employers to be the employer.




(2)

An organized group of employers may be recognized by the appeal
tribunal for the purposes of subsection (1) only if the organized
group includes among its members employers in the subclass of
industry to which the employer who has ceased to be an employer
belonged.




(3)

If, for the purposes of the review under section 96.2 of a
decision respecting a specific matter, an organized group of
employers or an employers' adviser was deemed to be the employer,
the group or employers' adviser, as the case may be, is deemed to
be the employer for the purposes of appealing the review officer's
decision in that matter and participating in the appeal.






Health professional assistance




249

(1)


In this section,
"health professional"
means a medical practitioner, a person entitled to practise
medicine under the laws of another jurisdiction or any other
person with prescribed qualifications.




(2)

The chair must establish a list of health professionals who may be
retained to provide independent assistance or advice on the
request of the appeal tribunal in an appeal.




(3)

The list established by the chair under subsection (2) must not
include any person who is employed by the Board.




(4)

After taking into account any fee schedule established by the
Board for services provided by health professionals, the chair may
determine the terms and conditions, including remuneration and
reimbursement of expenses, under which a health professional may
be retained by the appeal tribunal under this section.




(5)

Except with the written consent of the parties to the appeal, the
appeal tribunal must not retain a health professional to provide
independent assistance or advice in respect of a specific appeal
if the health professional




(a)

has previously examined the worker whose claim is the subject of
the appeal,




(b)

is treating or has previously treated the worker,




(c)

has been consulted in the treatment of the worker,




(d)

has acted as a consultant to the employer,




(e)

is a partner of or practises with a health professional described
in this subsection, or




(f)

is otherwise in circumstances that could result in a reasonable
apprehension of bias.




(6)

If the appeal tribunal determines that independent assistance or
advice from a health professional would assist in reaching a
decision on an appeal, the presiding member may retain a health
professional from the list described in subsection (2) to provide
such assistance or advice.




(7)

When a health professional is retained under subsection (6), the
presiding member must set the terms of reference for the advice,
including requiring a written report, setting any time periods for
providing the report and specifying any questions to be answered
in the report.




(8)

If the health professional retained under subsection (6) considers
it necessary to examine a worker in order to provide the
independent assistance or advice set out in the terms of reference
under subsection (7), the health professional may require the
worker to attend for an examination by giving the worker written
notice.




(9)

If the worker fails to present himself or herself for the
examination required under subsection (8) or obstructs that
examination without reasonable cause, the appeal tribunal may,
after giving notice to the worker, do one or more of the
following:




(a)

direct the health professional to reschedule the examination of
the worker and give the worker notice of the rescheduled
examination;




(b)

direct the health professional to provide a report without
examining the worker;




(c)

make a determination that the worker has abandoned the appeal.




(10)

The appeal tribunal must give a copy of the health professional's
written report to the parties to the appeal.




(11)

The parties to an appeal may make submissions to the appeal
tribunal in respect of the report provided to them under
subsection (10).




(12)

The appeal tribunal may suspend an appeal until a health
professional's report to be provided under this section in respect
of that appeal is received by the appeal tribunal.




(13)

Subsection (5) does not prohibit the appeal tribunal in an appeal




(a)

from requesting a health professional to provide it with medical
evidence or to clarify or interpret medical evidence previously
provided by the health professional, or




(b)

from compensating the health professional for the services
described in paragraph (a).




(14)

Evidence or advice given under subsection (13) is not independent
assistance or advice within the meaning of this section.






Appeal tribunal decision-making




250

(1)


The appeal tribunal may consider all questions of fact and law
arising in an appeal, but is not bound by legal precedent.




(2)

The appeal tribunal must make its decision based on the merits and
justice of the case, but in so doing the appeal tribunal must
apply a policy of the board of directors that is applicable in
that case.




(3)

Despite subsection (1), the appeal tribunal is bound by a prior
decision of a panel appointed under section 238 (6) unless




(a)

the specific circumstances of the matter under appeal are clearly
distinguishable from the circumstances addressed in the prior
decision,




(b)

subsequent to the prior decision, a policy of the board of
directors that the panel relied upon in the prior decision was
repealed, replaced or revised, or




(c)

the prior decision has been overruled under subsection (3.1) of
this section.




(3.1)

Despite subsection (3), a panel appointed under section 238 (6)
may overrule a prior decision of another panel appointed under
that section.




(4)

If the appeal tribunal is hearing an appeal respecting the
compensation of a worker and the evidence supporting different
findings on an issue is evenly weighted in that case, the appeal
tribunal must resolve that issue in a manner that favours the
worker.






Application of policies of board of directors




251

(1)


The appeal tribunal may refuse to apply a policy of the board of
directors only if the policy is so patently unreasonable that it
is not capable of being supported by the Act and its regulations.




(2)

If, in an appeal, the appeal tribunal considers that a policy of
the board of directors should not be applied, that issue must be
referred to the chair and the appeal proceedings must be suspended
until the chair makes a determination under subsection (4) or the
board of directors makes a determination under subsection (6), as
the case may be.




(3)

As soon as practicable after an issue is referred under subsection
(2), the chair must determine whether the policy should be
applied.




(4)

If the chair determines under subsection (3) that the policy
should be applied, the chair must refer the matter back to the
appeal tribunal and the tribunal is bound by that determination.




(5)

If the chair determines under subsection (3) that the policy
should not be applied, the chair must




(a)

send a notice of this determination, including the chair's written
reasons, to the board of directors, and




(b)

suspend any other appeal proceedings that are pending before the
appeal tribunal and that the chair considers to be affected by the
same policy until the board of directors makes a determination
under subsection (6).




(6)

Within 90 days after receipt of a notice under subsection (5) (a),
the board of directors must review the policy and determine
whether the appeal tribunal may refuse to apply it under
subsection (1).




(7)

On a review under subsection (6), the board of directors must
provide the following with an opportunity to make written
submissions:




(a)

the parties to the appeal referred to in subsection (2);




(b)

the parties to any appeals that were pending before the appeal
tribunal on the date the chair sent a notice under subsection (5)
(a) and that were suspended under subsection (5) (b).




(8)

After the board of directors makes a determination under
subsection (6), the board of directors must refer the matter back
to the appeal tribunal, and the appeal tribunal is bound by that
determination.




(9)

The chair must not make a general delegation of his or her
authority under subsection (3), (4) or (5), but if the chair
believes there may be a reasonable apprehension of bias the chair
may delegate this authority to a vice chair or to a panel of the
appeal tribunal for the purposes of a specific appeal.






Suspension of appeal proceedings




252

(1)


On application of the appellant or on the chair's own initiative,
the chair may suspend appeal proceedings if a Board's decision
respecting a matter that is related to the appeal is pending.




(2)

Within 30 days after the Board's decision referred to in
subsection (1) is made, the appellant may request the appeal
tribunal to continue the appeal proceedings and, on receipt of
that request, the appeal tribunal must continue the proceedings.




(3)

If the appellant requests the appeal tribunal to continue the
appeal proceedings before the Board's decision referred to in
subsection (1) is made, the chair may




(a)

direct the appeal tribunal to continue the proceedings, or




(b)

continue the suspension until the Board's decision is made.




(4)

On application, and where the chair is satisfied that




(a)

special circumstances existed which precluded the making of a
request within the time required in subsection (2), and




(b)

an injustice would otherwise result,


the chair may extend the time to make a request under subsection
(2) even if the time to make the request has expired.






Decision




253

(1)


On an appeal, the appeal tribunal may confirm, vary or cancel the
appealed decision or order.




(2)

appeal tribunal may make one of the following decisions:

the matter that is the subject of the application under section 96
(2) must be reopened;




(b)

the matter that is the subject of the application under section 96
(2) may not be reopened.




(3)

The appeal tribunal's final decision on an appeal must be made in
writing with reasons.




(4)

Subject to any suspensions of the appeal proceedings permitted
under this Part, the appeal tribunal must make its final decision
on an appeal

within 180 days after the appeal tribunal receives a copy of the
records provided under section 245 (3) respecting the matter under
appeal, or




(b)

if a shorter time period is prescribed by the Lieutenant Governor
in Council, within that shorter time period.




(5)

The chair may extend the applicable time period under subsection
(4) if




(a)

the complexity of the proceedings in the appeal or of the matter
under appeal makes the time period impractical, or




(b)

the appellant requests a delay in the proceedings to submit new
evidence or make additional submissions.




(6)

If the appellant has requested a delay for a reason referred to in
subsection (5) (b), the chair may extend the time for not more
than 45 days.




(7)

If the time is extended under subsection (6), the chair, on
application, must extend the time for an additional period not
exceeding that granted under subsection (6) to allow the other
parties to the appeal to submit new evidence or to make additional
submissions.




(8)

The chair may extend the time under this section even if the
applicable time period under subsection (4) has expired.

an accidental or inadvertent error, omission or other similar
mistake;

an arithmetical error made in a computation.

parties have been served with the final decision.

may apply to the appeal tribunal for clarification of the final
decision and the appeal tribunal may amend the final decision only
if the appeal tribunal considers that the amendment will clarify
the final decision.




(4)

The appeal tribunal may not amend a final decision other than in
those circumstances described in subsections (1) to (3).




(5)

This section must not be construed as limiting the appeal
tribunal's ability, on request of a party, to reopen an appeal in
order to cure a jurisdictional defect.

(1)  The average earnings and earning capacity of a worker must
be determined with reference to the average earnings and earning
capacity at the time of the injury, and may be calculated on the
daily, weekly or monthly wages or other regular remuneration which
the worker was receiving at the time of the injury, or on the
average yearly earnings of the worker for one or more years prior to
the injury, or on the probable yearly earning capacity of the worker
at the time of the injury, as may appear to the board best to
represent the actual loss of earnings suffered by the worker by
reason of the injury, but not so as in any case to exceed the
maximum wage rate, except that where, owing to the shortness of time
during which the worker was in the employment of his or her
employer, or in any employment, or the casual nature of his or her
employment, or the terms of it, it is inequitable to compute average
earnings in the manner described in this subsection, regard may be
had to the average daily, weekly or monthly amount which, as shown
by the records of the board, was being earned during the one or more
years or other period previous to the injury by a person in the same
or similar grade or class of employment.


(2)  The average earnings of ambulance drivers and attendants
and members of fire brigades working without remuneration is deemed
to be the same in amount as the average earnings in their regular
employment or employments, not, however, to be less than the amount
on which the employer has been assessed.


(3)  Where the board is satisfied that the average earnings of
the worker at the time of injury by reason of the worker's age or
the worker being in the course of learning a trade, occupation,
profession or calling do not truly represent the worker's average
yearly earnings or earning capacity, it may, in the case of
temporary disability, adjust from time to time the payments of
compensation to take into account the probable increase in average
earnings and may, in the case of permanent disability, calculate the
award by taking into account the probable increase in average
earnings.
