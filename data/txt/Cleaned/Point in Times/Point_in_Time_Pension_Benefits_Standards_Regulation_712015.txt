(b)

without limiting any other obligation on the plan contributor to
make payments under this section in relation to any previous
unfunded liability of the defined benefit component, if the current
actuarial valuation report establishes the existence of an unfunded
liability for the defined benefit component, a series of equal

must be sufficient, in the opinion of the reviewer who prepared that
actuarial valuation report, to amortize the unfunded liability
within the unfunded liability payment period applicable to it;




(c)

without limiting any other obligation on the plan contributor to
make payments under this section in relation to any previous
solvency deficiency of the defined benefit component, if the current

31, 2019.



Section 57 (3) and (12) BEFORE amended by BC Reg 264/2019, effective
December 31, 2019.




(3)

Instead of making the payments referred to in subsection (2) (b), in
the case of an unfunded liability, or the payments referred to in
subsection (2) (c), in the case of a solvency deficiency, the plan
contributor may elect to make payments into the plan under this
subsection if




(a)

the payments are made at least monthly over the unfunded liability
payment period or solvency deficiency payment period, as the case
may be, that is applicable to that unfunded liability or solvency
deficiency,




(b)

the payment amounts are identical and are calculated as a percentage
of the payroll or as an average amount per hour of employment that,
as at the review date of the actuarial valuation report by which the
existence of the unfunded liability or solvency deficiency was
established, was projected for the members, and




(c)

the actuarial present value of the payments over the period referred
to in paragraph (a), or any shorter period selected by the
administrator for the purposes of this subsection, is equal to that
unfunded liability or solvency deficiency.




(12)

If a plan contributor is required under subsection (2) or (3) to
make payments in relation to an unfunded liability or a solvency
deficiency, the plan contributor may make larger payments, more
frequent payments or earlier payments than what is required, and, in
that event, the plan contributor may, despite subsections (2) and
(3), reduce or eliminate subsequent payments provided that




(a)

the unfunded liability or solvency deficiency is eliminated within
the applicable unfunded liability payment period or solvency
deficiency payment period, as the case may be, and




(b)

the balance of the unfunded liability or solvency deficiency never
exceeds the amount of that unfunded liability or solvency deficiency
that would have existed had the full amount of the payments required
under subsection (2) or (3) been made.



Section 57 (4) to (9) BEFORE repealed by BC Reg 264/2019, effective
December 31, 2019.




(4)

Without limiting subsections (2) and (3), each unfunded liability
and solvency deficiency must be funded by a separate series of
payments under subsection (2) (b) or (c) or (3) and must not be
combined with any other unfunded liability or solvency deficiency.




(5)

If the current actuarial valuation report establishes that the
defined benefit component of the plan has no solvency deficiencies,
the reviewer may, in that actuarial valuation report, recalculate
the payments, if any, that are, under subsection (2) or (3),
required to be made in relation to any remaining unfunded liability
of the plan component and the plan contributors may pay into the
plan the recalculated payments instead of the payments that were
required before that recalculation.




(6)

If the current actuarial valuation report prepared on a going
concern basis in relation to a pension plan establishes that the
total amount of all unfunded liabilities of the plan component is
less than the total amount of all unfunded liabilities projected for
the plan component in the previously filed actuarial valuation
report, the amount of that actuarial gain must be used




(a)

to eliminate every unfunded liability of the plan component, or




(b)

if the amount of that actuarial gain is insufficient to eliminate
every unfunded liability of the plan component, to reduce the
unfunded liabilities of the plan component, with the unfunded
liabilities of the plan component being eliminated or reduced
chronologically, beginning with the oldest unfunded liability.




(7)

If the defined benefit component's actuarial gain is used in the
manner referred to in subsection (6) (b) to reduce the amount of an
unfunded liability, the payments that are, under subsection (2) or
(3), required to be made in relation to that unfunded liability may
be




(a)

reduced, on a prorated basis, and paid over




(i)

the remainder of the applicable unfunded liability payment period,
or




(ii)

a shorter period, or




(b)

left unreduced and paid over a shorter period than the applicable
unfunded liability payment period.




(8)

If the current actuarial valuation report prepared in relation to a
pension plan establishes that the total amount of all solvency
deficiencies of the plan component is less than the total amount of
all solvency deficiencies projected for the plan component in the
previously filed actuarial valuation report, the amount of that
actuarial gain must be used




(a)

to eliminate every solvency deficiency of the plan component, or




(b)

if the amount of that actuarial gain is insufficient to eliminate
every solvency deficiency of the plan component, to reduce the
solvency deficiencies of the plan component, with the solvency
deficiencies of the plan component being eliminated or reduced
chronologically, beginning with the oldest solvency deficiency.




(9)

If the defined benefit component's actuarial gain is used in the
manner referred to in subsection (8) (b) to reduce the amount of a
solvency deficiency, the payments that are, under subsection (2) or
(3), required to be made in relation to that solvency deficiency may
be




(a)

reduced, on a prorated basis, and paid over




(i)

the remainder of the applicable solvency deficiency payment period,
or




(ii)

a shorter period, or




(b)

left unreduced and paid over a shorter period than the applicable
solvency deficiency payment period.
