In this Instrument:


(a)
"recognized SRO"
means an SRO that is recognized as a self-regulatory organization
by the securities regulatory authority; and


(b)
"retail client"
means


(i)  an individual, unless the individual has a net worth
exceeding $5 million, or


(ii)  a person or company, other than an individual, unless
the person or company has total assets or annual revenues

Part 2 - Leverage Disclosure




Leverage Disclosure



2.1

(1)  When a registrant opens an account for a retail client
or when a registrant makes a recommendation to a retail client to
purchase securities using in whole or in part borrowed money, or
otherwise becomes aware of a retail client's intent to purchase
securities using in whole or in part borrowed money, the
registrant shall deliver to the retail client, before the retail
client purchases those securities, a written disclosure statement
in substantially the following words:


Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities
involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only.
If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to
repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains
the same even if the value of the securities purchased declines.


(2)  Before executing an order on behalf of a retail client
purchasing securities who to the knowledge of the registrant is
using in whole or in part borrowed money in connection with the
purchase, the registrant shall obtain an acknowledgement from the
retail client that specifically refers to the written disclosure
statement required by subsection (1) and confirms that the retail
client has read the written disclosure statement.


(3)  A registrant is not required to comply with subsections
(1) and (2) if:


(a) the registrant has delivered the written disclosure
statement required by subsection (1) to the retail client and the
client has delivered an acknowledgement within the six month
period prior to the registrant making the recommendation for
purchasing securities by using in whole or in part borrowed money,
or otherwise becoming aware of a retail client's intent to
purchase securities using in whole or in part borrowed money, or


(b) the registrant is subject to and complies with the
leverage disclosure by-laws, rules, regulations or policies of a
recognized SRO.





Exemption for Margin Accounts



2.2

Section 2.1 does not apply to purchases of securities by a retail
client on margin if the client's margin account is maintained with
a registrant that is a member of a recognized SRO and the margin
account is operated in accordance with the by-laws, rules,
regulations or policies of the recognized SRO.

revoke the consent referred to in paragraph (b), and the effect of
the revocation; and

necessary to provide the specific product or service that the
retail client has requested.

client consent to disclose confidential retail client information
