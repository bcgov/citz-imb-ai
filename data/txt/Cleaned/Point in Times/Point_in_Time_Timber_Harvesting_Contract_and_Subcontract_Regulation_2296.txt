Rate test





26.01

(a)

(b)


rates agreed to under another contract by either the licence holder or contractor for similar timber harvesting services;






(c)


rates agreed to under another contract by either the licence holder, the contractor or another person for each phase or component of a similar timber harvesting operation;

rates agreed to by other persons for similar timber harvesting services;






(e)


if necessary to make meaningful comparisons to any of the rates agreed to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, the impact on fair market rates likely to arise from differences between the timber harvesting operations that pertain to the rate in dispute, and the timber harvesting operations that pertain to any rate described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), including the following:

(ix)


differences in the cost of moving to a new operating area, if any;






(f)


any other similar data or criteria that the arbitrator considers relevant.






(3)


In determining fair market rates under subsection (1) an arbitrator must not include any consideration or goodwill associated with purchasing a replaceable contract or otherwise acquiring the right to provide timber harvesting services pursuant to a replaceable contract.






(4)


In determining a fair market rate under subsection (1), an arbitrator may consider rates for timber harvesting services on land other than Crown land.
