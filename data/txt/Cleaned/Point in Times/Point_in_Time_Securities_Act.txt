94

For the purposes of this Part,

another class


(i)  if, whether or not on conditions, it is or may be
convertible into or exchangeable for a security of the other
class, whether of the same or another issuer, or

one or more offers to acquire securities of a class, the
securities subject to any such offer or offers to acquire are
deemed to be securities subject to the offer to acquire of each

Acting jointly or in concert



96

(1)  For the purposes of this Part, it is a question of fact
as to whether a person is acting jointly or in concert with an

solely in an agency capacity for the offeror in connection with a
take over bid or an issuer bid and not executing principal
transactions for the registered dealer's own account in the class
of securities subject to the offer to acquire or performing
services beyond customary dealer's functions is not to be presumed
solely by reason of such agency relationship to be acting jointly
or in concert with the offeror in connection with the bid.

or to the acquisition or ownership of securities or to control or
direction over securities is to be construed to include a direct
