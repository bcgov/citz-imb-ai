1.2


(1) 							For the purposes of calculating a percentage of securities that are owned, held or under the direction of a person or company in the definition of "influential securityholder"


(a) the determination shall be made


(i)  first, by including in the calculation only voting securities or equity securities that are outstanding, and


(ii)  second, if the person or company is not an influential securityholder by reason of a calculation under subparagraph (i), by including all voting securities or equity securities that would be outstanding if all outstanding securities that are convertible or exchangeable into voting securities or equity securities, and all outstanding rights to acquire securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for, or carry the right to acquire, voting securities or equity securities, are considered to have been converted, exchanged or exercised, as the case may be, and


(b) securities held by a registrant in its capacity as an underwriter in the course of a distribution are considered not to be securities that the registrant holds, has the power to direct the voting of, or has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of.


(2)
A person or company is a related issuer of another person or company if


(a) the person or company is an influential securityholder of the other person or company,


(b) the other person or company is an influential securityholder of the person or company, or


(c) each of them is a related issuer of the same third person or company.

(2)
For a distribution of special warrants or a distribution made under a prospectus no registrant shall act


(a) as an underwriter if the registrant is the issuer or selling securityholder in the distribution; or

(3)
Subsection (2) does not apply to a distribution


(a) in which


(i)  at least one registrant acting as direct underwriter acts as principal, so long as an independent underwriter underwrites not less than the lesser of


(A)  20 percent of the dollar value of the distribution, and


(B)  the largest portion of the distribution underwritten by a registrant that is not an independent underwriter, or


(ii)  each registrant acting as direct underwriter acts as agent and is not obligated to act as principal, so long as an independent underwriter receives a portion of the total agents' fees equal to an amount not less than the lesser of


(A)  20 percent of the total agents' fees for the distribution, and


(B)  the largest portion of the agents' fees paid or payable to a registrant that is not an independent underwriter; and


(b) the identity of the independent underwriter and disclosure of the role of the independent underwriter in the structuring and pricing of the distribution and in the due diligence activities performed by the underwriters for the distribution is contained in
