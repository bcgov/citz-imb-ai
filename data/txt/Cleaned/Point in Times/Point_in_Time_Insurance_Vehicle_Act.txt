Third party rights




21


(1)
Even though he or she does not have a contractual relationship with the corporation, a person having a claim against an insured for which indemnity is provided by an owner's certificate under a plan or part of a plan is entitled, on recovering judgment against the insured or settlement with the corporation, to have the insurance money payable under a plan or part of a plan applied toward his or her judgment or the settlement and toward any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity; and he or she may, if a settlement is not made, on behalf of himself or herself and all persons having judgments or claims, maintain an action against the corporation to have the insurance money so applied.


(2)
For the purpose of this section, the corporation may at any stage compromise or settle the claim.


(3)
A creditor of the insured is not entitled to share in the insurance money payable under a certificate unless the creditor's claim is one for which indemnity is provided by that certificate.


(4)
No


(a) assignment, transfer, surrender, cancellation, suspension, waiver or discharge of a certificate, or of a provision of a plan or part of a plan, or of an interest in it or of insurance money payable under it, made by the insured after the event giving rise to a claim under the certificate occurs,


(b) act or default of the insured before or after that event in contravention of this Act, the regulations or a plan, or


(c) contravention of the

Criminal Code

or of a law or statute of any province, state or country by the owner or driver of the motor vehicle designated in the certificate


prejudices the right of a person entitled under subsection (1) to have the insurance money applied on his or her judgment or claim, or is available to the corporation as a defence to his or her action.


(5)
Despite subsection (4), if the limits of a contract of insurance that provides extension insurance in respect of the motor vehicle or trailer are in excess of the limits that apply to that motor vehicle or trailer under a plan or part of a plan of universal compulsory automobile insurance, the corporation may avail itself, against a person claiming under this section in respect of property damage, of any defence that the corporation is entitled to set up against the insured to the extent to which the limits of the insurance exceed the limits prescribed for the universal compulsory automobile insurance.


(6)
Without limiting section 30.1, if the corporation has paid an amount to a person under this section, by way of settlement or otherwise, that it would not otherwise be liable to pay, and has personally delivered or forwarded by registered mail to the last known address of the insured a demand for reimbursement of that amount, the insured is liable to reimburse the corporation that amount, and the corporation may enforce the right by action in court.


(7)
If the corporation denies liability to an insured under a plan or part of a plan, it may issue and serve a third party notice and be made a third party in any action to which the insured is a party and in which a claim is made against the insured by a party with respect to which it is or might be asserted that indemnity is provided under a plan or part of a plan, whether or not the insured has filed a defence in the action.


(8)
On being made a party under subsection (7), the corporation has the right to contest the insured's liability to any party claiming against the insured, and to contest the amount of any claim made against the insured, as if it were a defendant in the action, including, for that purpose, the right to


(a) deliver a statement of defence to the claim of any party claiming against the insured,


(b) deliver other pleadings,


(c) have production and discovery from any party adverse in interest, and


(d) examine and cross examine witnesses at trial.


(9)
If an insured agrees that the corporation would not, except for this section, be or become liable to make a payment in respect of a claim against the insured, he or she may at any time undertake to reimburse the corporation, by


(a) giving a written undertaking to repay the corporation the amount paid by it, and


(b) executing a consent to the payment by the corporation of that amount.


(10)
Subject to subsections (8) and (9), the corporation may, on payment of an amount under this section it would not otherwise be liable to pay, require an assignment of the judgment from the judgment creditor in a form registrable under the land title legislation, to the extent of that payment.


(11)
If the insured fails to dispute his or her liability to reimburse the corporation within 30 days after demand for reimbursement under subsection (6), in writing delivered to the head office of the corporation, the corporation is entitled to register the assignment under the land title legislation.


(12)
If the corporation has paid money in satisfaction of a claim, settlement or judgment under this section or by agreement under subsection (9), and the insured has not reimbursed the amount required under subsection (6) or (9), section 20 (12), (13) and (15) applies.


(13)
If


(a) a person obtains a judgment against an insured and is entitled to bring an action under subsection (1), and


(b) the corporation admits liability to the insured under the plan but considers that


(i)  there are or may be other claimants, or


(ii)  there is no willing person capable of giving and authorized to give a valid discharge for payment,


the corporation may apply to the court without notice to any person for an order for payment of the insurance money into court, and the court may so order, on the notice, if any, it considers necessary.


(14)
The receipt of the registrar or other proper officer of the court is a sufficient discharge to the corporation for money paid into court under subsection (13) and the money must be dealt with as the court orders on the application of any interested person.

Nothing in this section precludes the corporation from demanding from the claimant, as a condition precedent to payment, a release to the extent of the payment.


(4)
In an action in respect of bodily injury or death caused by a motor vehicle or trailer or its use or operation, the amount of benefits paid, or to which the claimant is or would have been entitled, must not be referred to or disclosed to the court or jury until the court has assessed the award of damages.

(b) may bring action in the name of the insured or in its own name to enforce the rights referred to in paragraph (a).


(2)
If money is recovered under subsection (1) and the burden of the loss is shared by the insurer and insured, the net amount, after deduction of the costs of recovery, must be divided between them in the same proportions as they bear the loss.


(3)
If the interest of the insured referred to in subsection (1) is limited to loss of or damage to a motor vehicle or loss of its use, the corporation has conduct of the action.


(4)
If the insured's interest is not one described in subsection (3), and the insured and the corporation cannot agree as to

Structured judgments




55

Negligence Act

, to the plaintiff for the net income loss that the plaintiff suffered in that period as a result of the accident, and


(b) the court must determine the degree to which defendants who are not designated defendants were at fault for that loss of income, and those defendants


(i)  are liable, in accordance with the

Negligence Act

, for that portion of the difference between


(A)  the net income loss that the plaintiff suffered in that period as a result of the accident, and


(B)  the gross income that the plaintiff would have earned in that period had the accident not occurred
