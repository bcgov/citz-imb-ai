on any of the following grounds:

• the decision of the housing cooperative is not reasonably supported by the facts, or


• the decision of the housing cooperative is not authorized by section 35 of the

.



Information about Appealing a Termination of Membership


1







1


The appeal of a termination of membership in a housing cooperative is governed by the

Cooperative Association Act

and Rule 18-3 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules. If you wish to appeal the decision to terminate your membership in the housing cooperative, you must first file a Notice of Appeal (Form 59, attached) in a Supreme Court registry within 30 days after the day you receive this Notice. (If you do not know where nearest the court registry is, consult the provincial government listings in the telephone directory.)




2


The Notice of Appeal is a notice to the housing cooperative that you are appealing its decision to terminate your membership and that a hearing has been scheduled with a judge to determine how the appeal should proceed. This hearing is

not

the appeal itself; it is an initial application to a judge for directions as to how the appeal should proceed. (The judge may give any direction he or she considers necessary for the proper hearing and determination of the appeal. The judge may, for example, order that certain documents be produced at the appeal or set time limits within which you and/or the housing cooperative must take certain steps.)




3


After completing the Notice of Appeal, except for the section that sets out the place and time of the hearing, the Notice of Appeal is ready to be filed at the court registry. On payment of a filing fee


†


, a date for the hearing will be set by the court registry when you present the Notice of Appeal for filing.




4


Within 14 days after the date on which you file your Notice of Appeal, you must inform the housing cooperative of your appeal and the date scheduled for a hearing by serving a copy of the Notice of Appeal on the housing cooperative. (The Notice of Appeal may be served on the housing cooperative by leaving it at its registered office; sending it by registered mail to the registered office of the housing cooperative; personally serving it on the directors or officers; or serving it in any manner listed in Rule 4-3 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules.)




5


You are advised to serve the Notice of Appeal on the housing cooperative immediately after it has been filed. (The Supreme Court Civil Rules require that there must be at least 7 days between the time the cooperative is served with a Notice of Appeal and the day of the hearing.)




6


After the initial hearing at which the judge issues directions as to how the appeal is to proceed, you must obtain a date from the court registrar for the hearing of the appeal. This is best accomplished in consultation with the housing cooperative to ensure that one of its representatives will be available to attend the hearing.




7


After the registrar gives you a date for the hearing of the appeal, you must file with the registrar a Notice of Hearing of Appeal (Form 59B, attached) and serve a copy of it on the housing cooperative. (The Notice of Hearing of Appeal may be served in the same manner as the Notice of Appeal.) The appeal of your termination of membership will be heard by a judge at the time and place set out in the Notice of Hearing of Appeal, and you will have an opportunity to present your appeal in accordance with any directions that were issued by the judge at the initial hearing for directions.




8


If after you've filed or served the Notice of Hearing of Appeal you decide not to proceed with the appeal, you must file a Notice of Abandonment of Appeal (Form 59C, attached) at the court registry and serve a copy of the Notice on the housing cooperative. Failure to properly notify the court registry and the housing cooperative may result in your having to pay the costs of an application to the court by the housing cooperative to dismiss the appeal and any other costs the court awards against you.




9


If you do not appeal the decision to terminate your membership, the housing cooperative is entitled to apply for an order of possession of the residential premises under section 172 of the

Cooperative Association Act

.







1.



You may represent yourself in the appeal or obtain legal representation, or you may have some other person represent you, provided that the person does not receive any compensation from you for acting on your behalf.

Legal assistance is available at no cost to certain persons. To determine whether you are eligible for such assistance, you must contact the Legal Services Society. Since appeals must be commenced within 30 days after the date on which you received this Notice, you are advised to contact the Legal Services Society as soon as possible.







†.



The housing cooperative is required to pay the fee for filing the Notice of Appeal if you are not in arrears for any monthly housing charge. If there is a dispute about the amount of the monthly housing charge the housing cooperative is still required to pay the filing fee provided that you are not in arrears for the amount of the monthly housing charge that is

not

in dispute.

You must make your request to the housing cooperative in writing within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Right to Appeal. If the housing cooperative pays the filing fee and you are not successful in your appeal, the housing cooperative is entitled to recover the amount of the filing fee from you.

If you are not eligible to require the housing cooperative to pay the filing fee, you may wish to contact the Legal Services Society for information about applying for legal aid or a court registry for details as to how to apply for indigent status. Since appeals must be commenced within 30 days after the date you received this Notice, you are advised to investigate the various options for payment of the filing fee as soon as possible.
