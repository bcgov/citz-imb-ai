If costs are ordered to be assessed as increased costs, the registrar must fix the fees that would have been allowed if an order for special costs had been made under Rule 61 (1), and must then allow 1/2 of those fees, or a higher or lower proportion as the court or justice may order.

(3)

Certain duties of the registrar

On an assessment of party and party costs, the registrar must allow those fees under Appendix B that were proper or reasonably necessary to conduct the proceeding.






(3)


In addition to the fees allowed on an assessment, the registrar must allow a reasonable amount for expenses and disbursements that were necessarily or properly incurred in the conduct of the proceeding.






(4)


If tax is payable by a party in respect of legal services, the registrar must allow an additional percentage, calculated on the monetary value of the units assessed, equal to the percentage rate of tax payable in respect of the legal services.






(5)


If tax is payable by a party in respect of disbursements, the registrar must allow an additional percentage, calculated on the monetary value of the disbursements as assessed, equal to the percentage rate of tax payable in respect of the disbursements.








Costs when party uses an employee as the party's lawyer





64



A party is not disentitled to costs on the ground that the lawyer who represented the party is an employee of the party.








Costs of particular issues or of any part of proceedings





65



The court or a justice may award costs that relate to some particular issue or part of the proceeding or may award costs except insofar as they relate to some particular issue or part of the proceeding.








Costs out of estate or property

If it is ordered that any costs must be paid out of an estate or property, the court or a justice may direct out of what portion of the estate or property the costs must be paid.

If a party entitled to receive costs is liable to pay costs to another party, the registrar may






(a)


assess the costs the party is liable to pay,

adjust the costs by way of deduction or set-off, or






(c)


delay the allowance of the costs the party is entitled to receive until the party has paid or tendered the costs the party is liable to pay.






(2)


If the costs of one party against a second party ought to be paid by a third party, the court or a justice may






(a)


order payment to be made by the third party to the first party directly, or

(b)


prepare a bill of costs in Form 30,

(d)


if the party intends to rely on facts at the assessment, obtain an affidavit to support those facts,






(e)

(f)


at least 5 days before the assessment, serve one filed copy of the appointment and supporting material on each person against whom costs are to be assessed.






(2)


The registrar may order that notice of an assessment of costs be given to a person whose interest, whether in a fund or estate or otherwise, may be affected.






(3)


If a party does not attend at the time appointed for an assessment of costs, the registrar may assess the costs in the party's absence.


[am. B.C. Regs. 62/2002, s. 5; 127/2010, s. 10.]








Certification of costs and enforcement





69



(1)


On the conclusion of an assessment, or if the person charged has consented to the amount, the registrar must, either by endorsing the original bill of costs or by signing a certificate in Form 31, certify the amount of costs awarded, and the party assessing costs may file the certificate.






(2)


If a certificate under subrule (1) has been filed, it may be enforced as if it were a judgment of the court referred to in section 22 of the Act.








Review of registrar's decision





70



A person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the registrar on an assessment may, within 7 days after the registrar has certified the costs, apply to a justice for a review of the assessment under section 10 (3) of the Act.








Consequences for solicitors for unnecessary or wasted costs





71



(1)


If the court or a justice considers that a solicitor for a party has caused costs to be incurred without reasonable cause, or has caused costs to be wasted through delay, neglect or some other fault, the court or justice may do one or more of the following:






(a)


disallow any fees and disbursements between the solicitor and the solicitor's client or, if those fees or disbursements have been paid, order that the solicitor repay some or all of them to the client;

Appendix B — Party and Party Costs







Application





1



Unless a special tariff is provided for in an enactment, this Appendix applies to the assessment of costs that are payable as between party and party in all appeals, applications for leave to appeal and all other proceedings in the Court of Appeal commenced after September 5, 1995.








Scale of costs





2



(1)


If a party is entitled to costs, the costs must be assessed under Scale 1 unless the court or a justice otherwise orders.






(2)


In fixing the scale of costs, the court or a justice must have regard to the following principles:






(a)


Scale 1 is for matters of ordinary difficulty;






(b)


Scale 2 is for matters of more than ordinary difficulty or importance;






(c)


Scale 3 is for matters of unusual difficulty or importance.






(3)


In fixing the appropriate scale under which costs will be assessed, the court or a justice may take into account the following:






(a)


whether a difficult issue of law, fact or construction is involved;






(b)


whether an issue is of importance to a class or body of persons, or is of general interest;






(c)


whether the result of the proceeding effectively determines the rights and obligations as between the parties beyond the relief that was actually granted or denied.








Value of units





3



(1)


The value for each unit allowed on an assessment is as follows:






(a)


Scale 1 — $60 for each unit;






(b)


Scale 2 — $80 for each unit;






(c)


Scale 3 — $100 for each unit.






(2)


If maximum and minimum numbers of units are provided for in an Item in the Tariff of Costs, the registrar has the discretion to allow a number within that range of units.






(3)


If the Tariff of Costs indicates a range of units in relation to costs to be assessed, the registrar must have regard to the following principles:






(a)


the fewest number of units is for matters on which little time should ordinarily have been spent;






(b)


the maximum number of units is for matters on which a great deal of time should ordinarily have been spent.








Discretion as to costs





4



(1)


The court or a justice may order, under section 2 (1), that






(a)


costs be awarded in an amount fixed by the court or justice, or






(b)


no costs be awarded against a party.






(2)


Without limiting subsection (1), the court or a justice may,






(a)


with the consent of the parties, fix a lump sum as the costs of the whole proceeding, either inclusive or exclusive of disbursements and expenses, and






(b)


on application by a party, or by consent, fix a lump sum as the costs of an application within the proceeding, either inclusive or exclusive of disbursements and expenses.






(3)


Without limiting subsection (1), if anything is done or omitted improperly or unnecessarily by or on behalf of a party, the court or a justice may order






(a)


that any costs arising from the act or omission not be allowed to the party, or






(b)


that the party pay the costs incurred by any other party by reason of the act or omission.








Apportionment if appeals heard together





5



If 2 or more appeals have, by order, been heard at the same time or heard one after the other and no order has been made to apportion costs, the registrar may






(a)


assess 2 or more bills as one bill,






(b)


allow an item once or more than once, or






(c)


apportion the costs of an item or of the whole bill between the appeals.








Preparation if activity does not take place





6



If, in the Tariff of Costs, units may be allowed for preparation of a record or for preparation for an application, conference or hearing, the registrar may allow units, up to the maximum number allowable, for that preparation even though the record is not ultimately required or the application, conference or hearing does not take place or is adjourned.








Offer to settle bill of costs





7



(1)


A party to an assessment may deliver to another party an offer to settle the amount of the bill of costs in Form 32 and, after the assessment has been completed, may produce the offer to the registrar.






(2)


If an offer is produced to the registrar under subsection (1), the registrar must determine whether the offer should have been accepted and, if so, may do one or more of the following as appropriate:






(a)


disallow, to the party presenting the bill, items of the tariff that relate to the assessment;






(b)


allow the party making the offer, by way of set off, items of the tariff that relate to the assessment;






(c)


allow to the party presenting the bill and making the offer double the value of items of the tariff that relate to the assessment.
