Notes to Table 1





1.


All values are in µg/g unless otherwise stated. Substances
must be analyzed using methods specified in protocols approved
under section 53 of the Contaminated Sites Regulation, B.C.
Reg. 375/96, or alternate methods acceptable to the director.








2.


The site-specific factors of human intake of contaminated soil
and toxicity to soil invertebrates and plants specified in
this matrix apply at all sites.








3.


Standard has been derived based on results of clinical studies
at sites. Standard represents the rounded sum of the
toxicologically-based value plus the soil ingestion clinical
study factor. For AL, PL and RL the soil ingestion clinical
study factor is 80 µg/g. For CL soil ingestion the clinical
study factor is 240 µg/g.








4.


Intake pathway of exposure modeled is inadvertent ingestion of
soil.








5.


Standard has been adjusted based on a reference provincial
background soil concentration. Standard represents the rounded
sum of the toxicologically-based value plus the reference
provincial background soil concentration. For all land uses,
the reference provincial background soil concentration is 14.9
µg/g.








6.


NS - no standard. Insufficient acceptable scientific data
exists, so no standard is calculated.





Notes to Table 2





7.


All values in µg/g unless otherwise stated. Substances must be
analyzed using methods specified in protocols approved under
section 53 of the Contaminated Sites Regulation, B.C. Reg.
375/96, or alternate methods acceptable to the director.








8.


The site-specific factors of human intake of contaminated soil
and toxicity to soil invertebrates and plants specified in
this matrix apply at all sites.








9.


If land is used to grow produce for human consumption, the
standard is 3 µg/g; if not, the standard is 35 µg/g.








10.


The 3 µg/g standard has been derived based on results of
clinical studies at sites. It represents the rounded remainder
of the toxicologically-based value, 35 µg/g, minus the soil
ingestion clinical study factor, 32 µg/g.








11.


Intake pathway of exposure modeled is inadvertent ingestion of
soil.








12.


The pH is the pH of the soil at a site.








13.


Standard has been adjusted based on a reference provincial
background soil concentration. Standard represents the rounded
sum of the toxicologically-based value plus the reference
provincial background soil concentration. For all land uses,
the reference provincial background soil concentration is 1.3
µg/g.








14.


NS - no standard. Insufficient acceptable scientific data
exists, so no standard is calculated.

16.


The site-specific factors of human intake of contaminated soil
and toxicity to soil invertebrates and plants specified in
this matrix apply at all sites.








17.


Intake pathway of exposure modeled is inadvertent ingestion of
soil.








18.


Standard is for chromium+6.








19.


Standard is for chromium (total).








20.


Standard has been adjusted based on a reference provincial
background soil concentration. Standard represents the rounded
sum of the toxicologically-based value plus the reference
provincial background soil concentration. For all land uses,
the reference provincial background soil concentration is 58.9
µg/g.








21.


Standard is for chromium+3.








22.


Standard is set equal to the Canadian Council of Ministers of
the Environment, 1999 - Nutrient and energy cycling check
value.








23.


Standard is applicable to both chromium+3 and chromium+6.





Notes to Table 4





24.


All values in µg/g unless otherwise stated. Substances must be
analyzed using methods specified in protocols approved under
section 53 of the Contaminated Sites Regulation, B.C. Reg.
375/96, or alternate methods acceptable to the director.








25.


The site-specific factors of human intake of contaminated soil

26.


Intake pathway of exposure modeled is inadvertent ingestion of
soil.








27.


The pH is the pH of the soil at a site.








28.


Standard has been adjusted based on a reference provincial
background soil concentration. Standard represents the rounded
sum of the toxicologically-based value plus the reference
provincial background soil concentration. For all land uses,
the reference provincial background soil concentration is 74.0
µg/g.








29.


Standard is applicable to livestock other than sheep. Consult
director for further advice.








30.


NS - no standard. Insufficient acceptable scientific data

and toxicity to soil invertebrates and plants specified in

33.


Intake pathway of exposure modeled is inadvertent ingestion of
soil.








34.


Standard has been derived based on clinical studies at sites.
Standard represents the rounded sum of the
toxicologically-based value, 115 µg/g, plus the soil ingestion
clinical study factor, 385 µg/g. For CL soil ingestion the
clinical study factor is 650 µg/g.








35.


The pH is the pH of the soil at a site.








36.


Standard has been adjusted based on a reference provincial
background soil concentration. Standard represents the rounded

Schedule 10.1 was enacted by BC Reg 243/2016 (as amended by BC Reg

Schedule 12 table items "manure" and "plant matter derived from
processing plants" BEFORE amended by BC Reg 7/2019, effective
February 28, 2019.




manure

animal excreta from pets, animals in zoological facilities,
fish held in commercial aquaculture or aquarium facilities,
livestock, farmed game or poultry, this does not include the
management of animal excreta (manure) on farms as defined as
agricultural waste in B.C. Reg. 131/92 but does include animal
excreta (manure) not included within the scope of B.C. Reg.
131/92.




plant matter derived from processing plants


fruit, vegetable and vegetative material derived from fruit
and vegetable processing plants, these are materials which
have been removed from an agricultural operation and no longer
fit within the definition of agricultural waste (agricultural
vegetation waste) as defined in B.C. Reg. 131/92.
