Written disclosure of a netback




(a)

Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 412/2007, App. A, s. 4 (g).]




(b)

must reflect netbacks calculated by subtracting royalties and
operating costs from revenues; and

BOEs and McfGEs




5.14


If written disclosure includes information expressed in BOEs,
McfGEs or other units of equivalency between oil and gas




(a)

the information must be presented




(i)

in the case of BOEs, using BOEs derived by converting gas to oil
in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of
oil (6 Mcf:1 bbl);




(ii)

in the case of McfGEs, using McfGEs derived by converting oil to
gas in the ratio of one barrel of oil to six thousand cubic feet
of gas (1 bbl:6 Mcf); and




(iii)

with the conversion ratio stated;




(b)

if the information is also presented using BOEs or McfGEs derived
using a conversion ratio other than a ratio specified in paragraph
(a), the disclosure must state that other conversion ratio and
explain why it has been chosen;




(c)

if the information is presented using a unit of equivalency other
than BOEs or McfGEs, the disclosure must identify the unit, state
the conversion ratio used and explain why it has been chosen; and




(d)

the disclosure must include a cautionary statement to the effect
that:



"BOEs [or McfGEs or other applicable units of equivalency] may be
misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion
ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl [or An McfGE conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf]
is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily
applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value
equivalency at the wellhead".

financial year


c = the change during the most recent financial year in
estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves


d = the change during the most recent financial year in
estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and
probable reserves


x = additions to proved reserves during the most recent
financial year, expressed in BOEs or other unit of equivalency


y = additions to proved reserves and probable reserves
during the most recent financial year, expressed in BOEs or other
unit of equivalency




(b)

the disclosure must include




(i)

the results of both methods of calculation under paragraph (a) and
a description of those methods;




(ii)

if the disclosure also includes a result derived using any other
method of calculation, a description of that method and the reason
for its use;




(iii)

for each result, comparative information for the most recent
financial year, the second most recent financial year and the
averages for the three most recent financial years;




(iv)

a cautionary statement to the effect that:



"The aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred
in the most recent financial year and the change during that year
in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect
total finding and development costs related to reserves additions
for that year"; and




(v)

the cautionary statement required under paragraph 5.14 (d).

1.
Consolidated Financial Disclosure
— If the reporting issuer files consolidated financial statements,
and if a significant portion of the reporting issuer's economic
interest in future net revenue is attributable to a consolidated
subsidiary in which there is a significant minority interest,
disclose that fact and the approximate portion of the economic
interest in future net revenue attributable to the minority
interest.



Form 51-101F1, item 2.4, Instruction (3) BEFORE repealed by BC Reg
380/2010, effective December 30, 2010.


(
3
)

Constant prices and costs are prices and costs used in an estimate
that are:



(
a
)

the reporting issuer's prices and costs as at the effective date
of the estimation, held constant throughout the estimated lives of
the properties to which the estimate applies;



(
b
)

if, and only to the extent that, there are fixed or presently
determinable future prices or costs to which the reporting issuer
is legally bound by a contractual or other obligation to supply a
physical product, including those for an extension period of a
contract that is likely to be extended, those prices or costs
rather than the prices and costs referred to in paragraph (a).




For the purpose of paragraph (a), the reporting issuer's prices
will be the posted price for oil and the spot price for gas, after
historical adjustments for transportation, gravity and other
factors.




Form 51-101F1, item 3.1 BEFORE amended by BC Reg 380/2010, effective
December 30, 2010.





Item 3.1  Constant Prices Used in Supplemental Estimates



If supplemental disclosure under Item 2.2 is made, then disclose,
for each product type, the benchmark reference prices for the
countries or regions in which the reporting issuer operates, as at
the last day of the reporting issuer's most recent financial year,
reflected in the reserves data disclosed in response to Item 2.2.



Form 51-101F1, item 3.2, instruction (2) BEFORE amended by BC Reg
380/2010, effective December 30, 2010.



(2) The term "constant prices and costs" and the defined term
"forecast prices and costs" include any fixed or presently
determinable future prices or costs to which the reporting issuer
is legally bound by a contractual or other obligation to supply a
physical product, including those for an extension period of a
contract that is likely to be extended. In effect, such
contractually committed prices override benchmark reference prices
for the purpose of estimating reserves data. To ensure that
disclosure under this Part is not misleading, the disclosure
should reflect such contractually committed prices.




Form 51-101F1, item 4.1, instruction (5) was added by BC Reg
380/2010, effective December 30, 2010.

or for its financial year then ended.




(5) This Form 51-101F1 sets out minimum requirements. A reporting
issuer may provide additional information not required in this
Form 51-101F1 provided that it is not misleading and not
inconsistent with the requirements of NI 51-101, and provided that
material information required to be disclosed is not omitted.

consolidated subsidiaries (whether or not wholly-owned); and


(ii) if a significant portion of reserves referred to in clause (i)
is attributable to a consolidated subsidiary in which there is a
significant non-controlling interest, disclose that fact and the
approximate portion of such reserves attributable to the
non-controllling interest;


(b)
Proportionate Consolidation
— if the reporting issuer files financial statements in which
investments are proportionately consolidated, the reporting issuer's
disclosed reserves must include the reporting issuer's proportionate
share of investees' oil and gas reserves; and


(c)
Equity Accounting
— if the reporting issuer files financial statements in which
investments are accounted for by the equity method, do not include
investees' oil and gas reserves in disclosed reserves of the
reporting issuer, but disclose the reporting issuer's share of
investees' oil and gas reserves separately.




Item 2.4  Future Net Revenue Disclosure Varies with
Accounting



1.
Consolidated Financial Disclosure

and if a significant portion of the reporting issuer's economic
interest in future net revenue is attributable to a consolidated
subsidiary in which there is a significant non-controlling interest,
disclose that fact and the approximate portion of the economic
interest in future net revenue attributable to the non-controllling
interest.


2.
Equity Accounting
— If the reporting issuer files financial statements in which
investments are accounted for by the equity method, do not include
investees' future net revenue in disclosed future net revenue of the
reporting issuer, but disclose the reporting issuer's share of
investees' future net revenue separately, by country and in the
aggregate.


INSTRUCTIONS



(1) Do not include, in reserves, oil or gas that is subject to
purchase under a long-term supply, purchase or similar agreement.
However, if the reporting issuer is a party to such an agreement
with a government or governmental authority, and participates in
the operation of the properties in which the oil or gas is
situated or otherwise serves as "producer" of the reserves (in
contrast to being an independent purchaser, broker, dealer or
importer), disclose separately the reporting issuer's interest in
the reserves that are subject to such agreements at the effective
date and the net quantity of oil or gas received by the reporting
issuer under the agreement during the year ended on the effective
date.




(2) Future net revenue includes the portion attributable to the
reporting issuer's interest under an agreement referred to in
Instruction (1).

REPORT ON RESERVES DATA BY INDEPENDENT QUALIFIED RESERVES
EVALUATOR OR AUDITOR



This is the form referred to in item 2 of section 2.1 of National
Instrument 51-101
Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities
("NI 51-101").


1. Terms to which a meaning is ascribed in NI 51-101 have the
same meaning in this form.


2. The report on reserves data referred to in item 2 of section
2.1 of NI 51-101, to be executed by one or more qualified reserves
evaluators or auditors independent of the reporting issuer, must in
all material respects be as follows:


Report on Reserves Data


To the board of directors of [name of reporting issuer] (the
"Company"):


1. We have [audited] [evaluated] [and reviewed] the Company's
reserves data as at [last day of the reporting issuer's most
recently completed financial year]. The reserves data are estimates
of proved reserves and probable reserves and related future net
revenue as at [last day of the reporting issuer's most recently
completed financial year], estimated using forecast prices and
costs.


2. The reserves data are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
reserves data based on our [audit] [evaluation] [and review].


We carried out our [audit] [evaluation] [and review] in accordance
with standards set out in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation
Handbook (the "COGE Handbook") prepared jointly by the Society of
Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (Calgary Chapter) and the Canadian
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy & Petroleum (Petroleum Society).


3. Those standards require that we plan and perform an [audit]
[evaluation] [and review] to obtain reasonable assurance as to
whether the reserves data are free of material misstatement. An
[audit] [evaluation] [and review] also includes assessing whether
the reserves data are in accordance with principles and definitions
presented in the COGE Handbook.


4. The following table sets forth the estimated future net
revenue (before deduction of income taxes) attributed to proved plus
probable reserves, estimated using forecast prices and costs and
calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent, included in the
reserves data of the Company [audited] [evaluated] [and reviewed] by
us for the year ended xxx xx, 20xx, and identifies the respective
portions thereof that we have [audited] [evaluated] [and reviewed]
and reported on to the Company's [management/board of directors]:

5. In our opinion, the reserves data respectively [audited]
[evaluated] by us have, in all material respects, been determined
and are in accordance with the COGE Handbook, consistently applied.
We express no opinion on the reserves data that we reviewed but did
not audit or evaluate.


6. We have no responsibility to update our reports referred to
in paragraph 4 for events and circumstances occurring after their
respective preparation dates.


7. Because the reserves data are based on judgements regarding
future events, actual results will vary and the variations may be
