(4.1)
In determining the percentage change in the average CPI for the purposes of subsections (3.1) (a) (i) and (4) (a), the average CPI for any January 1 is deemed to be the greater of


(a) the average CPI calculated for that date, and


(b) the highest average CPI calculated for any preceding January 1.


(5)
Subject to subsections (3.1) and (4), the cost of living benefits granted on any January 1 must be calculated to provide all retired members a uniform percentage increase in the portions of their pensions eligible for adjustment.

Division 2 - Highest Average Salary





Calculation of highest average salary — full time service




97


(1)
This section applies only to a member whose service was full time during the 60 months immediately preceding termination of employment.


(2)
Subject to subsection (3), the highest average salary of a member who is entitled to a pension is the average of 1/12th of the annual salary that the member earned, or is deemed to have earned, in each fiscal year


(a) during the 5 years of service in which the member received, or is deemed to have received, his or her highest salary before the date on which the member begins receiving a pension, or


(b) during the member's actual period of pensionable service, if the member's period of pensionable service is less than 5 years.


(3)
If a member does not terminate employment at the end of a fiscal year and, if the annualized salary for that partial year is equal to or higher than the annual salaries received, or deemed to have been received, in each of the 5 full years of highest annual salary as determined under subsection (2), the partial year may be combined as required with a portion of the salary of the lowest of the 5 years in order to calculate a highest annual salary for the combined year, and the combined year can be used in place of the lowest of the 5 years, but in no case can the total of the 2 portions exceed one year of salary.






Calculation of highest average salary — less than full time service




98


(1)
This section applies only to a member whose service was less than full time during the 60 months immediately preceding termination of employment.


(2)
The highest average salary of a member who is entitled to a pension is the greater of


(a) the average of 1/12th of the annual salary that the member earned, or is deemed to have earned, in each fiscal year during the 5 years of service immediately before the date on which the member begins receiving a pension, adjusted in each of those years by an additional amount which is calculated by using salary from a year or multiple years of previous service, to compensate for those periods in a year that the member was not working, multiplied by the ratio that the pension index for the calendar year before the year of adjustment bears to the pension index for the calendar year of previous service, and


(b) subject to subsection (3), the average of 1/12th of the annual salary that the member earned, or is deemed to have earned, in each fiscal year


(i)  during the equivalent of 5 full time years of service in which the member received, or is deemed to have received, his or her highest salary before the date on which the member begins receiving a pension, or


(ii)  during the member's actual period of pensionable service, if the member's period of pensionable service is less than the equivalent of 5 full time years,


adjusted to its full time equivalent.


(3)
For the purpose of calculating the highest average salary in subsection (2) (b), if a member does not terminate employment at the end of a fiscal year and, if the annualized full time equivalent of the salary for that partial year as determined under subsection (2) (b) is equal to or higher than the annual salaries received, or deemed to have been received, in each of the equivalent of 5 full time years of highest annual salary as determined under subsection (2) (b), the partial year may be combined as required with a portion of the salary of the lowest of the equivalent of 5 full time years in order to calculate a highest annual salary for the combined year, and the combined year can be used in place of the lowest of the 5 years, but in no case can the total of the 2 portions exceed one year of full time equivalent salary.

(a) by the ratio that the pension index of the year ending December 31, 1980 bears to the pension index of the calendar year in which the member terminated employment, and


(b) by the method set out in subsection (5) from January 1, 1981 to the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the pension is to be granted.


(4)
If an inactive member, whose employment terminated on or after January 1, 1981, is entitled to and applies to receive a pension under this Plan, the plan administrative agent must adjust the highest average salary of the member, as determined under section 97 or 98, by the method set out in subsection (5) from the first of the month following the month in which termination of employment occurred to the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the pension is to be granted.


(5)
The inactive member's highest average salary is increased in each calendar year during the period referred to in subsections (3) and (4) by the percentage, for each of those calendar years, as follows:


(a) if the member's pension is granted in the same calendar year as the year in which termination of employment occurred, the proration, for the number of complete months from the date of termination of employment to the end of the month immediately preceding the effective date of the pension benefit, of the percentage increase granted to pensions on January 1 of the calendar year of termination;

(iii)  the proration, for the number of complete months from January 1 of the year the pension is granted to the end of the month immediately preceding the effective date of the pension benefit, of the percentage increase granted to pensions on January 1 of that calendar year.
