3

(1)


Subject to section 5, a permit holder must pay annually a fee for

(2)

Subject to subsection (5), the fee for each permit under

type, as specified in Column 2 of Schedule A opposite the permit
type in Column 1, to the sum of the fees for each contaminant
authorized under the permit.




(3)

The fee for each contaminant under subsection (2) is calculated by
multiplying the quantity of the contaminant authorized by permit
for the 12 months prior to the anniversary date of the permit by
the unit fee for that contaminant, as specified in Schedule B, C
or D for the applicable payment date as set out in Column 2
opposite the contaminant in Column 1.




(4)

The quantity of each contaminant discharged that is used to
calculate the annual fee is determined from




(a)

the maximum authorized discharge rate and concentration specified
in the permit or by regulation, and




(b)

the discharge factors as determined in accordance with procedures
approved by the director if the permit does not specify the
concentration of the contaminants contained in the discharges.

(b)

is required under section 3.1 (1) of the Organic Matter Recycling

(6)

If a permit is amended after its anniversary date and, as a
result, the amount of the annual fee changes, the change to the
annual fee takes effect on the next anniversary date.
