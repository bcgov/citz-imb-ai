GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:



General



(1) This Form describes the disclosure required in a
simplified prospectus of a mutual fund. Each Item of this Form
outlines disclosure requirements. Instructions to help you provide
this disclosure are printed in italic type.




(2) Terms defined in National Instrument 81-101 Mutual Fund
Prospectus Disclosure, National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds
or National Instrument 81-105 Mutual Fund Sales Practices and used
in this Form have the meanings that they have in those national
instruments.




(3) A simplified prospectus shall state the required
information concisely and in plain language. Reference should be
made to Part 3 of Companion Policy 81-101CP for a discussion
concerning plain language and presentation.




(4) Respond as simply and directly as is reasonably possible
and include only as much information as is necessary for an
understanding of the fundamental and particular characteristics of
the mutual fund. Brevity is especially important in describing
practices or aspects of a mutual fund's operations that do not
differ materially from those of other mutual funds.




(5) National Instrument 81-101 requires the simplified
prospectus to be presented in a format that assists in readability
and comprehension. This Form does not mandate the use of a
specific format to achieve these goals. However, mutual funds are
encouraged to use, as appropriate, tables, captions, bullet points
or other organizational techniques that assist in presenting the
required disclosure clearly and concisely.




(6) Each Item shall be presented under the heading or
sub-heading stipulated in this Form; references to the relevant
Item number are optional. If no sub-heading for an Item is
stipulated in this Form, a mutual fund may include sub-headings,
under the required headings, at its option.




(7) A simplified prospectus may contain photographs and
artwork only if they are relevant to the business of the mutual
fund, mutual fund family or members of the organization of the
mutual fund and are not misleading.




(8) Any footnotes to tables provided for under any Item in
this Form may be deleted if the substance of the footnotes is
otherwise provided.



Contents of a Simplified Prospectus



(9) A simplified prospectus shall pertain to one mutual fund,
and shall consist of two sections, a Part A section and a
Part B section.




(10) The Part A section of a simplified prospectus contains
the response to the Items in Part A of this Form and contains
introductory information about the mutual fund, general
information about mutual funds and information applicable to the
mutual funds managed by the mutual fund organization.




(11) The Part B section of a simplified prospectus contains
the response to the Items in Part B of this Form and contains
specific information about the mutual fund to which the simplified
prospectus pertains.




(12) Despite securities legislation, a simplified prospectus
shall present each Item in the Part A section and each Item
in the Part B section in the respective order provided for in
this Form. However, the Part B section of the simplified
prospectus may be placed in any location in the simplified
prospectus. For a single SP, this means that the Part B
section may be placed before the Part A section, somewhere in
the middle of the Part A section or after the Part A
section, except for the covers.




(13) Subsection 5.1 (3) of National Instrument 81-101 permits
certain documents to be attached to, or bound with, a simplified
prospectus. Those documents consist of the documents incorporated
by reference into the simplified prospectus, educational material,
account application documents, registered tax plan applications
and documents and any point of sale disclosure documents required
by securities legislation. No other documents may be attached to,
or bound with, a simplified prospectus.




Consolidation of Simplified Prospectuses into a Multiple SP




(14) Subsection 5.1 (1) of National Instrument 81-101 states that
simplified prospectuses shall not be consolidated to form a
multiple SP unless the Part A sections of each simplified
prospectus are substantially similar. The Part A sections in a
consolidated document need not be repeated. These provisions
permit a mutual fund organization to create a document that
contains the disclosure for a number of mutual funds in the same
family.




(14.1) Subsection 5.1 (4) of National Instrument 81-101 states
that a simplified prospectus of an alternative mutual fund must
not be consolidated with a simplified prospectus of another mutual
fund that is not an alternative mutual fund.




(15) As with a single SP, a multiple SP will consist of two
Parts:




1. A Part A section that contains general information about the
mutual funds, or the mutual fund family, described in the
document.




2. A number of Part B sections, each of which will provide
specific information about one mutual fund. The Part B
sections shall not be consolidated with each other so that, in a
multiple SP, information about each of the mutual funds described
in the document shall be provided on a fund by fund or catalogue
basis and shall set out for each mutual fund separately the
information required by Part B of this Form. Each Part B section
shall start on a new page.




(16) For a multiple SP in which the Part A and Part B
sections are bound together, the Part B sections may be
placed at any location in the document; that is, before the
Part A section, somewhere in the middle of the Part A
section or after the Part A section, except for the back
cover. If the Part B sections are bound with the Part A
section, the Part B sections shall be kept together in the
document.




(17) Section 5.3 of National Instrument 81-101 permits the
Part B sections of a multiple SP to be bound separately from the
Part A section of the document. If one Part B section is
bound separately from the Part A section of the document, all
Part B sections must be separate from the Part A section
of the document.




(18) Subsection 5.3 (2) of National Instrument 81-101 permits Part
B sections that have been bound separately from the related Part A
section to either be bound individually or together, at the option
of the mutual fund organization. There is no prohibition against
the same Part B section of a multiple SP being bound by itself for
distribution to some investors, and also being bound with the Part
B section of other mutual funds for distribution to other
investors.




(19) Section 3.2 of National Instrument 81-101 provides that
the requirement under securities legislation to deliver a
prospectus for a mutual fund will be satisfied by the delivery of
a simplified prospectus, either with or without the documents
incorporated by reference. Mutual fund organizations that bind
separately the Part B sections of a multiple SP from the
Part A section are reminded that, since a simplified
prospectus consists of a Part A section and a Part B
section, delivery of both sections is necessary in order to
satisfy the delivery obligations in connection with the sale of
securities of a particular mutual fund.




(20) In Items 1 through 4 of Part A of this Form, specific
instructions are provided for a single SP and a multiple SP and in
some cases for a multiple SP for which the Part A section is
either bound with, or separate from, the Part B sections of
the document. The remainder of Part A of this Form generally
refers to disclosure required for "a mutual fund" in a "simplified
prospectus". This disclosure should be modified as appropriate to
reflect multiple mutual funds covered by a multiple SP.



Multi-Class Mutual Funds



(21) A mutual fund that has more than one class or series
that are referable to the same portfolio may treat each class or
series as a separate mutual fund for purposes of this Form, or may
combine disclosure of one or more of the classes or series in one
simplified prospectus. If disclosure pertaining to more than one
class or series is combined in one simplified prospectus, separate
disclosure in response to each Item in this Form must be provided
for each class or series unless the responses would be identical
for each class or series.




(22) As provided in National Instrument 81-102, a section,
part, class or series of a class of securities of a mutual fund
that is referable to a separate portfolio of assets is considered
to be a separate mutual fund. Those principles are applicable to
National Instrument 81-101 and this Form.

legislation of a number of jurisdictions to the effect that a
mutual fund shall not make an investment in respect of which a
related person will receive any fee or compensation except for
fees paid pursuant to a contract disclosed in, among other things,
a prospectus. Another example is the requirement of some
jurisdictions that certain statements be included in a simplified
prospectus of a mutual fund with a non-Canadian manager.

(2) Specify each sales charge option as a percentage. For an
initial sales charge, include a range for the amount that can be
charged, if applicable. For a deferred sales charge, provide the
full sales charge schedule.




(3) Specify each sales charge option in dollar terms. For an
initial sales charge, include a range for the amount that can be
charged on every $1,000 investment, if applicable. For a deferred
sales charge, include a range for the amount that can be charged
on every $1,000 redemption.




(4) Provide a brief overview of the key elements of how each sales
charge option works, including:



• whether the amount payable is negotiable;



• whether the amount payable is deducted from the amount paid at
the time of purchase or from the amount received at the time of
sale;




• who pays and who receives the amount payable under each sales
charge option.




In the case of a deferred sales charge, the disclosure must also
briefly state:



• any amount payable as an upfront sales commission;



• who pays and who receives the amount payable as the upfront
sales commission;




• any free redemption amount and key details about how it works;




• whether switches can be made without incurring a sales charge;
and




• how the amount paid by an investor at the time of a redemption
of securities is calculated; for example, whether it is based on
the net asset value of those securities at the time of redemption
or another time.
