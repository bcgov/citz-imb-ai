A judge may, in any year, elect to forgo up to 5 days of his vacation leave entitlement for that year and to take that vacation leave at a later time, but the maximum amount of vacation leave entitlement that may be accumulated in this way is 30 days.

If the chief judge considers that the operational needs of the court are best served by allowing a judge to forgo more than the 5 days, or to accumulate more than the 30 days provided for under subsection (1), the judge may exceed these limits as authorized by the chief judge.
