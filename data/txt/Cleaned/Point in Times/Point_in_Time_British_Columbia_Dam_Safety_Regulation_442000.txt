Rating




Loss of Life




Economic and

Social Loss




Environmental and

Cultural Losses





VERY HIGH


Large potential for multiple

loss of life involving residents

and working, travelling and/or recreating public. Development within inundation area (the area that could be flooded if the dam fails) typically includes communities, extensive commercial and work areas,

main highways, railways, and locations of concentrated recreational activity. Estimated fatalities could exceed 100.


Very high economic losses

affecting infrastructure, public

and commercial facilities in and beyond inundation area. Typically includes destruction of or extensive damage to large residential areas, concentrated commercial land uses, highways, railways, power lines, pipelines and other utilities. Estimated direct and indirect (interruption of service) costs could exceed $100 million.


Loss or significant deterioration

of nationally or provincially

important fisheries habitat

(including water quality), wildlife

habitat, rare and/or endangered

species, unique landscapes or

sites of cultural significance.

Feasibility and/or practicality

of restoration and/or compensation

is low.




HIGH


Some potential for multiple

loss of life involving residents,

and working, travelling and/or recreating public. Development within inundation area typically includes highways and railways, commercial and work areas, locations of concentrated recreational activity and scattered residences. Estimated fatalities less than 100.


Substantial economic losses

affecting infrastructure, public

and commercial facilities in

and beyond inundation area. Typically includes destruction

of or extensive damage to concentrated commercial land uses, highways, railways, power lines, pipelines and other utilities. Scattered residences may be destroyed or severely damaged. Estimated direct and indirect (interruption of service) costs could exceed $1 million.


Loss or significant deterioration of nationally or provincially important fisheries habitat (including water quality), wildlife habitat, rare and/or endangered species, unique

landscapes or sites of cultural significance. Feasibility and

practicality of restoration and/or compensation is high.




LOW


Low potential for multiple loss of life. Inundation area is typically undeveloped except for minor roads, temporarily inhabited or non- residential farms and rural activities. There must be a reliable element of natural warning if larger development exists.


Low economic losses to limited infrastructure, public and commercial activities. Estimated direct and indirect (interruption of service) costs could exceed $100 000.


Loss or significant deterioration of regionally important fisheries habitat (including water quality), wildlife habitat, rare and endangered species, unique landscapes or sites of cultural significance. Feasibility and practicality of restoration and/or compensation is high. Includes situations where recovery would occur with time without restoration.




VERY LOW


Minimal potential for any loss of life. The inundation area is typically undeveloped.


Minimal economic losses typically limited to owner's property not to exceed $100 000. Virtually no potential exists for future development of other land uses within the foreseeable future.


No significant loss or deterioration of fisheries habitat, wildlife habitat, rare or endangered species, unique landscapes or sites of cultural significance.

Operation, Maintenance, and Surveillance Manual.







(a).



Site surveillance may consist of visual inspections and/or monitoring of automated data acquisition systems. Reduced frequencies of visual inspections may be determined by seasonal conditions.







(b).



Formal Inspections are intended as more thorough inspections performed by the appropriate representative of the owner responsible for safety surveillance.







(c).



A Dam Safety Review involves collection of all available dam records, field inspections, detailed investigations and possibly laboratory testing. It then proceeds with a check of structural stability and operational safety of the dam, beginning with a reappraisal of basic features and assumptions. The level of detail required in a Dam Safety Review should be commensurate with the importance and complexity of the dam, as well as the consequences of failure.







(d).



Dam owners must conduct an annual review of conditions downstream of their dam and notify a dam safety officer if the downstream consequence classification level increases. The downstream consequence classification guide is shown in Schedule 1.
