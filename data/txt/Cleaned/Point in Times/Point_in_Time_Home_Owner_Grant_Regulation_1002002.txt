EXPLANATORY NOTES — HOME OWNER GRANT




These notes are intended for general guidance only and

are subject to the detailed provisions in the Act and regulations.



To obtain the grant, you must complete and submit an application form. If you qualify for the additional grant (see below) and wish to obtain it, you must complete the box on the application form that best describes your qualification and provide the required information and forms.





Who may qualify




1


You may qualify for a grant if


(a) you are an owner (as defined in the

Local Government Act

and the

Taxation (Rural Area) Act

, which includes a lessee under a registered lease of 99 years or more who is required to pay the current year taxes),


(b) you are a permanent resident of British Columbia (either a Canadian citizen or a landed immigrant), and


(c) you occupy as your principal residence the dwelling described on your application form.






2


You and your spouse together may qualify for only one grant on one residence in British Columbia in any one calendar year even if you live in separate residences (unless you are legally separated).






3


If you are the spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister of a qualifying deceased owner, you may be eligible for the grant in the year of the owner's death if the residence was your principal residence at the time of death.






4


You may qualify for the additional grant if


(a) you are over 65 (please state your birth date on the application form), or


(b) you have a permanent disability, or are the spouse, child, grandchild, parent, step-parent or person standing in the place of a parent, grandparent, brother or sister of a person with a permanent disability who resides in your home (complete the required forms which are available from your collector).

Corporations are not eligible for a grant unless they qualify as owners of eligible buildings, land cooperatives or multi-dwelling leased parcels, as defined in the

Home Owner Grant Act

7


If an owner is unable to apply in person, the owner's committee or a person appointed in writing as the owner's attorney (Power of Attorney) or authorized representative (Representation Agreement) may apply on behalf of the owner.

To avoid penalty for late payment of your taxes, you must apply for a grant on or before the tax due date (you may apply before the tax due date even if you are not paying your taxes before the due date).

INSTRUCTIONS TO PROPERTY OWNER






1


If you are a property owner and have a permanent disability, or you are the spouse or relative of a person with a permanent disability who resides in your principal residence, you may be eligible for an additional grant under Schedule 2 of the

Home Owner Grant Act

.


Note:

"Relative"

means a child, grandchild, brother, sister, parent, step-parent or grandparent of the person with disabilities or a person who stands in place of a parent to the person with disabilities.






2


To be eligible to receive the additional grant, you must have original receipts and documentation showing that in order to manage normal daily functioning in the principal residence you, on your own behalf or on behalf of your relative or spouse,


(a) are incurring costs for physical assistance in your principal residence that exceed $150 per month, or


(b) have incurred costs for structural modifications to your principal residence that exceed an aggregate of $2 000.






3


If a provincial or federal government agency or private insurer covers the costs for the physical assistance or structural modifications through the provision of benefits or payments (for example, workers compensation benefits, Insurance Corporation of British Columbia payments, or Canada Pension Plan disability benefits), the costs incurred are not eligible costs under the Home Owner Grant Regulation.






4


To apply, you must submit a certificate in Form B. Once a medical doctor has completed Part A in respect of the person with disabilities and you have completed Part B, forward the certificate to your municipal or provincial tax collector, along with your application for the Home Owner Grant, before the tax due date in the first year in which you apply for the additional grant.




GENERAL INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES



The following guidelines should be considered by

physicians

when providing information about a patient in Part A and by

owners

when completing Part B:





1


The intent of section 6 of the Home Owner Grant Regulation is to allow a home owner an additional grant under Schedule 2 of the

Home Owner Grant Act

if either the owner has a permanent disability or the owner is the spouse or relative of a person with a permanent disability who resides in the owner's principal residence and that person requires physical assistance or structural modifications to the home in order to manage normal daily functioning in the principal residence.






2


The disability must be of a permanent nature and there must be no remedial therapy available to the individual which would significantly lessen the disability.






3


A person does not necessarily qualify if he or she is in receipt of a disability pension or workers compensation benefits.






4



"Physical assistance"

means regular and extensive supervision or care that is necessary for the person with disabilities to manage normal daily functioning in their principal residence (for example, meal preparation, assistance with personal care or hygiene) but does not include assistance for activities outside the principal residence.






5



"Structural modifications"

means structural changes to the principal residence that are necessary for the person with disabilities to manage normal daily functioning in the principal residence (for example, access ramps, widening of doorways, installation of an elevator or other lifting device).







Schedule 3 was enacted by BC Reg 197/2021, effective July 15, 2021.
