Petroleum and Natural Gas Act


Petroleum and Natural Gas Grid Regulation





Definitions



1

(1)  In this regulation,
"Act"
means the
Petroleum and Natural Gas Act
.


(2)  For the purposes of the Act and this regulation:


"block"
means an area described in section 5;


"Peace River Block"
means that area of land described in Schedule 1;


"unit"
means an area described in section 4.





Application



2

The petroleum and natural gas grid is used to determine the
location in British Columbia of petroleum and natural gas tenures
under the Act, geothermal resource tenures under the
Geothermal Resources Act
and coal tenures under the
Coal Act
.





Petroleum and natural gas grid



3

(1)  The petroleum and natural gas grid is defined by a set
of universal transverse mercator map projection coordinates for
the northeast corner of each unit, all as described in Schedule 3.


(2)  The petroleum and natural gas grid unit coordinates are
based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), a system of
latitudes and longitudes defined by the positions of Provincial
geodetic control monuments based on the international geocentric
ellipsoid of revolution reference system titled Geodetic Reference
System 1980.


(3)  Notwithstanding subsection (1), the defining of the
petroleum and natural gas grid using universal transverse mercator
map projection coordinates does not affect existing rights and
recognized the historical petroleum and natural gas grid using the
North American Datum of 1927 system of latitudes and longitudes.





Units



4

A unit is an area defined by the coordinates given in Schedule 3
for its northeast corner and the coordinates of those units which
have their northeast corners common to the northwest, southwest
and southeast corners of the unit.





Blocks



5

(1)  A block consists of 100 units.


(2)  Within a block, units are numbered from 1 to 100, from
right to left, as follows:


(a) unit number 1 has its southeast corner nearest an even
degree of latitude or an even multiple of 5 minutes therefrom and
nearest an even degree of longitude or an even multiple of 7
minutes and 30 seconds therefrom referenced to NAD83, and with
unit number 1 in the southeast corner of the block;


(b) unit number 10 is in the southwest corner of the block;


(c) unit number 91 is in the northeast corner of the block;


(d) unit number 100 is in the northwest corner of the block.


(3)  Blocks are identified by the letters A through L, with
one letter assigned to each block, starting in the southeast
corner of the group, and are identified from right to left, in 3
rows of 4 columns each, as A, B, C, D, H, G, F, E, I, J, K and L
.





Groups



6

(1)  A group consists of 12 blocks, identified by the letters
A through L as described in section 5 (3).


(2)  Groups are named, for the purposes of identification
only, in accordance with the nearest whole map sheet of the
National Topographic Series system of mapping, using the 15
minutes of latitude by 30 minutes of longitude breakdown.





Prescribed areas



7

For the purposes of section 58 (2) of the Act, the prescribed
areas are set out in Schedule 2.
