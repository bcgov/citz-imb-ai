protection of the public, and they may isolate the person in the

cannot conveniently be had in the place where he or she was found.

and neglected state, or is inhabited by too many persons, the

prejudicial to health or any health hazard is found to exist
within its jurisdiction, and if after the local board has required
the removal or termination of the thing or health hazard within a
specified time the local board finds that default in the removal
or termination has been made, and the case seems to the local
board one involving considerations of difficulty, because the
removal or termination involves the expenditure or loss of a
considerable sum of money, or because any trade or industry is
seriously interfered with, or because of other circumstances, the
local board may apply to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to
appoint a person to investigate and report on the case.

the health hazard or thing, the local board or any person
aggrieved may apply to the Supreme Court for an order for the
removal or termination of the health hazard or thing, and to
restrain the proprietor of any trade or industry referred to in
subsection (1) from carrying on that trade or industry until
the health hazard or thing has been terminated to the satisfaction
of the minister, and the court may issue the order on the report
of the person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and
