estimate is for an amount that is different from the actual amount
of the lien as established under subsections (3) and (4), the
director may correct the amount by registering a new lien in the
revised amount and discharging the original lien, but for the
purpose of subsection (7) the new registration is deemed to be
registered at the same time as the registration it revises.

(a)

on the oral or written request of a person, disclose in writing
whether a lien is registered against the personal or real property

to provide to the director the records and information required by
the director to confirm or rebut that belief.




(11)

The director may determine that the corporations are associated
corporations for the purposes of this section if




(a)

a corporation that has been requested to provide records or
information to the director under subsection (10) fails or refuses
to comply with that request within a period of time considered by
the director to be reasonable in the circumstances, or

may register a lien under this section against the real and
personal property of the corporation.

registered under subsection (12) at any time after the

on those assets until the later of




(a)

the date that is 90 days after the date on which the notice
required under subsection (12) (a) was sent to the corporation,
and




(b)

if a notice of appeal is served on the minister in respect of the
determination within the time provided by section 56, the date on
which the minister upholds the determination under that appeal.

corporations were not associated within the meaning of section 256
of the
Income Tax Act
(Canada) at the time that the lien was registered under subsection
(12) (b) of this section or if the minister or a court of
competent jurisdiction upholds the corporation's appeal against
the director's determination on the basis that the corporations
were not associated at the time that the lien was registered, the
director must,




(a)

if the director has not realized on any of the assets against
which the lien was registered, promptly release the lien, and




(b)

if the director has realized on some or all of the assets against
which the lien was registered, promptly release the lien against
the remaining assets and pay the proceeds realized from the sale
of the realized assets, minus any costs or expenses incurred in
the sale,




(i)

to the corporation, or




(ii)

if the director considers it appropriate to do so, into the
Supreme Court under Rule 10-3 of the Supreme Court Civil
Rules.




(15)

The release of the lien under subsection (14) (a) or the release
of the lien and payment of the applicable net sale proceeds under
subsection (14) (b) is deemed to be full satisfaction of all
claims any person, including the corporation, might have arising
out of or in any way connected with the determination made under
subsection (11), the registration of the lien or the seizure or
sale of any or all of the assets against which the lien was
registered.
