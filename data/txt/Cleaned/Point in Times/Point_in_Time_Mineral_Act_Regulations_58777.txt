Cost statements submitted only on the Statement of Exploration and Development will not be considered.


(2)
In a separate section clearly defined and tabulated in a table of contents, the applicant shall submit, in support of the claimed cost, an itemized cost statement setting forth


(a) number of days, rates per day, specific date and total

wages

paid every person employed,


(b) number of days, rates per day, specific dates documenting food and

accommodation

charges for all persons employed during the investigation,

Geological mapping and the report thereon, done by a geologist, geological engineer or mining engineer not registered as in section 5 (2) may be acceptable at the discretion of the ministry; provided that a statement of qualifications is included in the report and demonstrates that the author has documented relevant training and experience.


(4)
The geological mapping must be suitably detailed and comprehensive, and must contribute significantly to knowledge of the geology of the claims area and mine workings. Accounts of brief property examinations are therefore generally unacceptable. Reports which are predominantly expressions of opinion or compilations of published material, or those based on scanty data, are not acceptable. Resubmission of previously accepted documents is not desired and can delay acceptance of reports.


(5)
The text must describe the lithology and structure of the rocks and any mineralization observed in them. Wherever identifiable, ore minerals, such as chalcopyrite, should be named and not merely reported as copper mineralization.


(6)
The report must include a geological map or maps which show the location and outline of outcrops, the name of the rock exposed, and significant geological structures and mineralization. The map must have a legend which identifies the symbols used and the rock types. The units on the map must be coded with numbers or patterns to conform with numbered or patterned map units in the legend. Coding by colour is not acceptable.


(7)
Geological mapping of underground workings may be acceptable, provided that:


(a) the outline of the workings and the geological observations are shown on a plan or plans at a standard scale of 1:1 200 (1 inch = 100 feet) or more detailed. A standard scale of 1:500 (1 inch = approximately 40 feet) is recommended. Generally only one level should be shown on each plan; 2 or more levels can be shown only if their data do not overlap. Raises, stopes and other non-horizontal workings should be shown in section. The elevation of the workings must be given;


(b) multiple workings are tied together with a co-ordinate system;


(c) a surface plan is included which adequately ties the workings into identifiable surface features and the index map.


(8)
Geological mapping of trenches that expose bedrock may be acceptable providing that the outline of the trenches and the detailed geological observations are shown on a plan or plans at a standard scale of 1:1 200 (1 inch =100 feet) or more detailed. A standard scale of 1:500 (1 inch = approximately 40 feet) is recommended.

Spurious results from a malfunctioning instrument are of no value and should be omitted. Suspect results should be identified by a suitable symbol or note.


(7)
The report must contain a drawing or drawings showing the numerical values obtained and their location. If the results are presented in profile or pseudo profile form, a plan map is required at a scale of 1:12 000 (1 inch = 1 000 feet) or more detailed, showing the survey grid in relation to the claims and such surface features as will correlate it with the index map.


(8)
An interpretation and evaluation of the results must be submitted. Information relevant to this interpretation (geology, topography, etc.) must be included.


(9)
In a report on a magnetic survey, the map or profiles should show whether the values represent the total intensity of the magnetic field or the vertical component, whether the values are absolute or relative, and the units these values are recorded in. The text should state whether the values were corrected for diurnal variation and the method used to achieve this. The values so corrected constitute basic data and should be submitted. Results of any other mathematical treatments should be shown on separate drawings.


(10)
In a report on an electromagnetic survey, the method and array should be clearly identified. The location of the transmitter for a very low radio frequency (VLF) survey should be stated.

(b) the geophysical results and the flight lines must be accurately located in relation to each other and the claims and identifiable geographic features. Terrain clearance must also be stated;


(c) at his discretion, the chief gold commissioner may accept, in addition to surveys made of the property, surveys extending beyond the boundaries of the property, to include an area containing up to 10 times the area of the mineral claims held by the applicant. Thus for each claim unit of 25 hectares held, there may be credited an airborne geophysical survey of 250 hectares, including the claim unit. Surveys extending beyond the limits outlined may be submitted for portable assessment credit under section 12 (1) (b);


(d) upon demand, at any time up to 3 years from the anniversary date following approval of credit, the applicant must submit to the chief gold commissioner records showing all geophysical observations, including copies of all airborne geophysical tapes or other records, a continuous record of elevations above the ground, and data used to relate airborne readings to ground positions.

Portable assessment credit (PAC) accounts




12


(1)

PAC Deposits



(a)

Assessment reports

— Upon approval of technical reports submitted pursuant to these regulations, the

value of work requested

will be applied to the claims as designated on the Statement of Exploration and Development. Approved

value in excess of that requested

to be applied to the claims will be credited in a PAC account to registered owners and/or operators as designated on the Statement of Exploration and Development, on approval of the chief gold commissioner.


(b)

Other reports

— Information from any technical exploration work begun in British Columbia after April 30, 1977, and

not submitted under section (12) (1) (a)

may be submitted in accordance with the assessment report format outlined in sections 1 to 4, for PAC consideration. The

total

value of such reports approved by Resource Data staff will be credited to the submitter's PAC account. Reports must document work performed within 3 years of the time of submission for PAC consideration.


All reports in this category should be submitted directly to the Resource Data Section, Geological Division, Mineral Resources Branch.


(c)

Deposits from claims

— In the case of an expropriation of a claim located on land over which a park is created subsequent to the location of the claim, the chief gold commissioner may, as part of the compensation settlement, authorize the deposit to the title holder's PAC account of the value of all or a portion of the recorded technical work credits applied to the expropriated claim.


(2)

PAC Withdrawals — Assessment Work Credit



(a) If desired by the owner or operator, PAC credits may be used for assessment work credit on the following basis. Upon submission of an Assessment Report, up to 30% of the value of the assessment work approved on the Statement of Exploration and Development may be taken from the owner's or operator's PAC account and added to the work value to make up the total value of work requested to be applied to the claims (approved to the nearest $100).


(b) When this procedure is chosen by the owner or operator, recording fees must be paid on the total value requested to be applied to the claims at the time of recording the Statement of Exploration and Development.





Example 1:



$






Total value of assessment work done (and approved) ............


22 500






PAC account transferral request*..............................................


6 750






Total ..................................................................................


29 250






* Maximum 30% of $22 500








Value to be applied as per application ......................................


29 200






(Recording fees payable at time of application ...........................


1 460)






(Excess value returned to owner's PAC account ....................


50)







Example 2:









(Work on 4 units, maximum allowable value under the


Mineral Act



2


is 4 x $200 x 10 years = $8 000.)



$






Total value of assessment work done (and approved) .............

(In this case, addition of the maximum 30% PAC allowance

of $2 100 would exceed 10 year limit.)






(3)

PAC Withdrawals — Recording Fee Refunds



(a) Upon submission of original mining receipts, and a refund application signed by the PAC account depositor, fees paid for the recording of assessment work may be refunded to the free miner named on the receipt on the basis of a deduction of $100 from the owner's or operator's PAC account for every $5 recording fee refund.


(b) Such requests must be submitted annually, during the month of May, to the Resource Data Section, Geological Division, Mineral Resources Branch. Refunds will be considered for all fees paid for recording work beginning January 1, 1978. Refund submissions must apply to mining receipts dated in the previous calendar year only. The first annual submissions from owners would be in May 1979.


(4)

PAC Withdrawals — Extension of 10 Year Limit



In the case where there has been a minimum of 10 years work recorded on a claim, and no further work has been done to extend title within 60 days prior to forfeiture, the owner may, upon application and submission of recording fees, use his PAC deposit on the basis of $200 per 2 post claim per year or $200 per unit per year, to hold that identical claim up to a maximum additional 5 years. Only one such extension of this nature can be applied for.


(5)

General



(a) PAC depositors will be notified by letter to their last known address whenever additions or subtractions are made to their PAC accounts.


(b) With respect to Assessment Reports (12 (1) (a)), PAC credits will be entered in the name of the registered owner(s) and/or operator(s) (company(ies) paying for the work) designated on the Statement of Exploration and Development.


(c) With respect to other reports (12 (1) (b)), PAC credits will be entered in the name of the company or individual submitting the report.


(d) The Resource Data Section reserves the right to reject reports that are considered to be essentially a duplication of previously submitted information, regardless of authorship.


(e) Physical Work and Prospecting Reports are not acceptable for Portable Assessment Credit.


(6)

PAC Withdrawals — Assessment Work Credit As Compensation



In the case of an expropriation of a claim on land over which a park is created subsequent to the location of the claim, the chief gold commissioner may, as part of the compensation settlement, authorize an assessment credit from the title holder's PAC account to be applied to one or more claims held by the recorded title holder under the requirements in section 29 of the Act. Credit must be applied to the claim in accordance with the values specified in section 19 (1) and (2) of B.C. Reg. 297/88, the
