For the purpose of section 74.1 of the Act, a pension plan that suspended or reduced the benefits of a former member under the authority of section 22.1 must resume the payment of full benefits, effective on the coming into force of this section, in accordance with the schedule of periodic payments that existed immediately before the suspension or reduction.






(3)


The actual payment of full benefits under subsection (2) must be made not later than 90 days after the date this section comes into force.

(5)


The calculation of a reduction under subsection (4) must be based on an assumed age for the former member, and spouse if applicable, calculated in accordance with the method described in section 22 (4) or as provided for in section 22 (6).






(6)


A pension plan that suspended or reduced the benefits of a former member under section 22.1 must continue to contain an appeal procedure, including a right of appeal within a reasonable period of time by the former member to the board of trustees of the plan, regarding

a decision by the plan to suspend or reduce the former member's benefits, and

(9)


For the purpose of subsection (8), if the suspension or reduction has lasted for 6 months or longer, before calculating the amount of the survivor benefit the former member's pension must be recalculated under subsections (4) and (5) as if the former member had qualified for a resumption of benefit payments starting on the date on which he or she died.

Interest on contributions





24



(1)


Subject to this section, the rate of interest to be applied for the purposes of section 31 (4) of the Act is






(a)


the rate specified in subsection (3), or






(b)


the rate of interest calculated on the basis of the average of the yields of 5-year personal fixed term chartered bank deposit rates, published in the Bank of Canada Banking and Financial Statistics as CANSIM Series B 14045, over a reasonably recent period, such that the averaging period does not exceed 12 months.






(2)


The method first selected under subsection (1) to calculate the rate of interest may not be changed without the prior written consent of the superintendent.






(3)


Subject to this section, the rate of interest to be applied to contributions for the purposes of section 31 (2) and (3) of the Act is the amount determined under the plan as the gross rate of interest earned by the pension fund that holds those contributions, for the most recently completed period for which interest is to be applied, less the rate attributable to any expenses of administering the plan relating to that period that are not required to be paid by the employer.






(4)


Interest must be calculated at least annually, promptly after the end of each fiscal year.






(5)


Interest must be applied at least annually as follows:






(a)


to member contributions, additional voluntary contributions and, if applicable, employer contributions made to the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the most recently completed fiscal year, together with prior interest credited on those contributions, at the applicable interest rate prescribed by subsection (1) or (3);






(b)


to member contributions, additional voluntary contributions and, if applicable, employer contributions made during the most recently completed fiscal year at one half of the applicable interest rate prescribed by subsection (1) or (3).






(6)


If a person becomes entitled to have a refund of contributions, interest must be applied, with respect to all member contributions, additional voluntary contributions and, if applicable, employer contributions, to the end of the month immediately preceding






(a)


the date of payment or return of contributions, or






(b)


the first payment in a series of payments,


at whichever of the following rates is provided for in the plan:






(c)


the rate calculated by dividing 365 into the product of the number of days in the uncompleted fiscal year with respect to which interest is to be paid and the applicable rate provided for by subsection (1) at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year;






(d)


the actual net rate of interest earned by the plan during that portion of the uncompleted fiscal year as determined under subsection (3);






(e)


an estimate of the actual net rate of interest determined solely on the basis of information regarding the performance of the investments of the assets of the plan during that portion of the uncompleted fiscal year, as reported to the administrator by the fund holder or the person making the plan investments.






(7)


If, in a defined benefit plan, the rate determined under subsection (6) would result in a negative interest rate, the interest rate to be applied under that subsection is zero.






(8)


Once the method of calculating the rate under subsection (6) has been chosen in respect of a fiscal year, that method must be used with respect to all benefit payments from the plan to be made during that fiscal year.






(9)


Notwithstanding subsections (5) and (6), the plan may provide for interest on contributions referred to in those subsections to be calculated in another manner and at other rates as the superintendent considers reasonable.






(10)


For the purposes of section 31 (1) of the Act,

"contributions"

does not include contributions returned to a member of a plan or to an employer who participated in a plan if the contributions are returned to avoid revocation of the plan's registration under the

Every transfer must be made in accordance with this section.






(3)


If a plan has a solvency ratio of 1 or more, a transfer shall not be deemed to impair the solvency of the plan for the purposes of section 60 (3) of the Act but the superintendent may, on the written request of an administrator, permit the administrator to refuse the transfer if the superintendent agrees with the administrator's assessment that the transfer would in fact materially impair the solvency of the plan.






(4)


If the commuted value under a plan is higher than the amount that would result if the definition of

"commuted value"

in section 1 (1) of the Act were applied, the administrator must ensure that supplementary calculations are made to ensure that the solvency of the plan will not be materially impaired by the transfer.






(5)

(b)


the transfer deficiency for any person is less than 5% of the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings for the year in which the transfer is made and the total of all transfer deficiencies since the last review date does not exceed 5% of the market value of the assets of the plan at the time of transfer.

(7)


Subject to section 60 (3) of the Act, a transfer deficiency that remains untransferred must be transferred within 5 years of the initial transfer and must include interest, at a rate that is not less than the rate of interest that was assumed in determining the commuted value of the benefit, up to the end of the month immediately preceding the date when the last or only transfer is made.






(8)


If the administrator is unable to make the transfer under subsection (7) following the expiry of the 5 year period because the person has not provided a forwarding address, the person entitled to the transfer must notify the administrator as to where the transfer is to be made.






(9)


Notwithstanding subsection (7), if a person who is entitled to the transfer dies during the 5 year period, the transfer deficiency becomes immediately payable.

Life income fund type payments from pension plans





30.1



(1)


A pension plan may provide for payments of pension benefits similar to the method of payments available from a life income fund, provided that






(a)


the payments are permitted under the

Income Tax Act

(Canada) and the regulations under the

Income Tax Act

(Canada),






(b)


the plan text contains provisions governing the payments, including the amount of income paid during a year,

(e)


the administrator, within 90 days of the beginning of each calendar year, provides to the member or former member the information described in section (12) (a), as if the member or former member's pension entitlement from which the payments are being derived was being operated as a life income fund under section 30, and






(f)


the member or former member continues to have the entitlements provided by section 33 of the Act as long as the pension entitlement from which the payments are being derived remains in the plan.

[am. B.C. Regs. 337/94, s. 3; 455/99, s. 21.]








Integration formula

Canada Pension Plan

(Canada) or the

Quebec Pension Plan

(Quebec) calculated as of the date of termination of that person's employment or membership, and




B

the number of months of employment or membership, not to exceed 420, credited to the person under the pension plan.











Maximum commutable amounts





33



(1)

[am. B.C. Reg. 455/99, s. 22.]








Conversion on shortened life expectancy





34



(1)


For the purposes of section 40 (2) of the Act, the conversion of a pension or a part of it to a payment or series of payments must be done using actuarial assumptions that do not take into account the shortened life expectancy of the person referred to in that subsection.






(2)


For the purposes of section 40 (2) of the Act, the person referred to in that subsection may make an election only if the spouse of the person has waived the joint and survivor pension entitlement in the form and manner set out in Form 2 of Schedule 2.








Solvency tests and funding of plans





35



(1)


This section and section 35.1 apply only to pension plans that contain one or more defined benefit provisions.






(2)


For the purposes of sections 41 (1.1) and (2) of the Act, every plan to which this section applies must be funded in accordance with the tests for solvency of pensions set out in this section and, to the extent if any applicable, with section 35.1.






(3)


Subject to subsection (4) and section 35.1, every employer must pay into a plan,






(a)


in respect of current employment, employer contributions made at least quarterly in an amount that is equal to the normal actuarial cost allocated to the employer as stated in the most recent actuarial valuation report filed,






(b)


if the plan has an unfunded liability, equal payments made at least quarterly in an amount that is sufficient to amortize the unfunded liability over a period not exceeding 15 years from the review date that established the unfunded liability, and






(c)


if the plan has a solvency deficiency, equal payments made at least quarterly in an amount that is sufficient to amortize the solvency deficiency as follows:






(i)


with respect to a solvency deficiency determined on or after January 1, 1993 and before January 1, 1998, payments must be made over a period from the review date that established the solvency deficiency and ending no later than January 1, 2003;






(ii)


with respect to a solvency deficiency determined on or after January 1, 1998, payments must be made over a period not exceeding 5 years from the review date that established the solvency deficiency.






(3.1)


If a plan is terminated under the conditions referred to in section 51 (2) of the Act, a schedule of special payments must be established as of the date of termination for the solvency deficiency to be amortized over a period of 5 years.






(3.2)


For the purposes of section 4 (3), 6 (2) (d), this section and section 51 (2) of the Act, the solvency deficiency must be considered to have been retired if a subsequent valuation reveals that there is no longer a solvency deficiency.






(3.3)


For the purposes of section 51 (2) of the Act, the assets of a plan are to be distributed, as soon as approval is granted under section 55 (1) of the Act, on a prorated basis according to the solvency ratio of the plan as of the date of termination, with the remaining portion of the member's entitlement to be distributed within 5 years of the date of termination.






(4)


Notwithstanding the special payments referred to in subsection (3) (b) and (c), the employer may elect instead to make payments at least quarterly, such that






(a)


each payment is a constant percentage of the future payroll of the members projected as of the date of the original establishment of the unfunded liability or solvency deficiency, and






(b)


the actuarial present value of all the payments over the period selected for the purposes of this section is equal to that liability or solvency deficiency.






(5)


Each unfunded liability or solvency deficiency must be funded separately and not combined with any other unfunded liability or solvency deficiency.






(6)


If a solvency deficiency has been amortized, the reviewer may recalculate any special payments for any unfunded liability that has not been amortized and the employer may make the special payments as recalculated instead of the special payments calculated at the review date relating to the establishment of that unfunded liability.






(7)


If the filed actuarial valuation report reveals that the plan has actuarial gains, the actuarial gains must be used to amortize or, where insufficient to amortize, to reduce the outstanding balance of any unfunded liability, with the oldest established unfunded liabilities being amortized or reduced before later ones.






(8)


If actuarial gains are used in the manner referred to in subsection (7), further special payments may be






(a)


reduced on a prorated basis over the remainder of the period referred to in subsection (3),






(b)


made over a shorter period than that referred to in subsection (3), or






(c)


on a basis that is a combination of paragraphs (a) and (b).






(9)


Notwithstanding subsection (8), actuarial gains in a multi-employer plan may be separately determined, allocated and used in respect of a particular participating employer or group of participating employers, but, in relation to the specific employer or group of employers respecting whom the actuarial gains are used, subsection (8) otherwise applies.






(10)


If no unfunded liability exists and no solvency deficiency exists, surplus assets may






(a)


be used to increase benefits,






(b)


be left in the plan,






(c)


subject to sections 41 (1.2) and 62 of the Act and section 36 of this regulation, be applied to reduce the employer contributions referred to in subsection (3) (a), or






(d)


subject to sections 61 and 62 of the Act and section 42 of this regulation, be paid or transferred to the employer.






(11)


The rate of amortization of an unfunded liability or solvency deficiency established under subsection (3) or (4) may be increased at any time by






(a)


increasing the amount of special payments,






(b)


making special payments in advance, or






(c)


making additional payments of any kind,


and where, in respect of a fiscal year, the rate of amortization is so increased or actuarial gains are allocated to reduce or amortize an unfunded liability, the amount of a special payment for a subsequent fiscal year may be reduced.






(12)


Notwithstanding subsection (11), the outstanding balance of any unfunded liability or solvency deficiency, taking into account any reduction of an unfunded liability by virtue of subsection (7), must at no time be greater than it would have been had the full special payments required by subsection (3) or (4) for the subsequent fiscal years been made and the rate of amortization had not been increased under subsection (11).






(13)


Notwithstanding subsection (3) and section 6 (4), if a plan is reviewed or the latest review is revised under section 6 (4), the applicable periods referred to in subsection (3) (b) and (c) respectively must be treated as commencing to run from the date when the amendment is made.






(14)


If a plan has a transfer agreement, as defined in section 18 (1) of the Act, the reviewer must establish the basis for transfers so that any transfer will not impair the solvency of the plan.






(15)


If employer contributions to a defined benefit multi-employer negotiated cost plan are based on a fixed rate of dollars or portions of dollars per hour of employment, the reviewer must perform supplementary tests to demonstrate that the rate and amount of contributions are sufficient to meet the solvency and funding tests, including the normal actuarial cost and special payments, and, if that sufficiency cannot be demonstrated, the reviewer must so advise the administrator.






(16)


If the contributions to a defined benefit multi-employer negotiated cost plan are not sufficient to meet the funding requirements of this regulation, the reviewer must, within 60 days, propose options to the administrator that will have the result that the required contributions will be sufficient to provide the benefits under the plan.






(17)


Within 90 days of receiving the options proposed by the reviewer under subsection (16), the administrator must notify the superintendent that the sufficiency cannot be demonstrated and the steps that will be taken so that the amount of contributions will become sufficient to meet the funding requirements of this regulation or, subject to section 59 (3) of the Act, to reduce benefits or entitlements under the plan.






(18)


If an insured plan established before January 1, 1993 is funded by level premiums to pensionable age for each individual member, the insured plan shall be deemed to meet the solvency tests.






(19)


If a fiscal year is longer or shorter than 12 months, the amount required to be paid under this section must be increased or reduced proportionately.






(20)


If, on any subsequent review date after the initial review date, the sum of the solvency assets and the solvency asset adjustment exceeds the liabilities of a plan determined on a plan termination basis, the special payments under subsection (3) (c) with respect to solvency deficiencies arising before the subsequent review date that are scheduled for payment after that subsequent review date may be adjusted as follows:






(a)


if the excess is greater than or equal to the present value of the special payments under subsection (3) (c), the special payments may be reduced to zero;






(b)


if the excess is less than the present value of the special payments under subsection (3) (c), the monthly rate of the special payments must not be changed but the amortization period or periods for the special payments may be reduced so as to reduce the excess to zero.






(21)


Despite subsection (20), if






(a)


the benefits of a plan are reduced under section 59 of the Act, and






(b)


a subsequent review of the plan under section 6 (4) of this regulation indicates an improvement in the financial position of the plan due to that reduction,


further special payments may, with the written consent of the superintendent,






(c)


be reduced on a prorated basis over the remainder of the period referred to in subsection (3),






(d)


be made over a shorter period than that referred to in subsection (3), or






(e)


be made on a basis that is a combination of paragraphs (c) and (d).

(a)


has not received any document that the administrator is required to send to the holder under subsection (6) and, so far as applicable, subsection (7), (8) or (11), and

has not received notice that the pension plan is or is about to be terminated,


then the holder must, on the next business day, demand payment for the full amount of the letter of credit.

ensure that the interest payments referred to in paragraph (a) are included in the amount covered by the letter of credit.






(22)


The employer must pay any fees related to the establishment and maintenance of the conforming letter of credit separately, and those fees may not be included in the letter of credit or charged as a cost to the pension plan.






(23)


When a person becomes entitled to receive a benefit payment, other than an ongoing pension payment, from the pension plan and while some or all of the solvency deficiency payments remain covered by a conforming letter of credit, the employer must






(a)


make one lump sum payment to the plan in an amount that is equal to any transfer deficiency that exists and to the extent that it relates to the person, before making the payment to or on behalf of the person, or






(b)


include a payment in the same amount in the next remittance of contributions.






(24)

I am the same gender as, and have been living with, the member or former member in a marriage like relationship for the preceding 2 years.




3


I understand that my spouse wishes to transfer his/her pension benefit to a Life Income Fund (LIF), or to receive LIF-type payments directly from the pension plan, and that my written consent is required to enable my spouse to do so.




4


I understand that






(a)


transferring the pension benefit to a LIF will allow my spouse to manage his or her own pension fund money, and will allow some flexibility in determining when the money is used,






(b)


the remaining funds in the LIF or in the pension plan may be used to purchase a life annuity at any time, but there is no requirement that the remaining funds be used to purchase a life annuity at any time, and






(c)


if the remaining funds are used to purchase a life annuity, the life annuity must be a joint and last survivor annuity unless I waive my entitlements by signing a separate spousal waiver form within 90 days before the start of the annuity.




5


I further understand that before purchasing a life annuity, the LIF or the pension plan, as the case may be, will allow my spouse to withdraw some of the money each year, subject to minimum and maximum withdrawal limits. The maximum withdrawal limit is designed to try to ensure that sufficient money remains to provide a lifetime income. I understand, however, that if






(a)


my spouse elects to withdraw the maximum amount permitted each year, and/or






(b)


the investment performance of the fund is poor,






the level of pension income or survivor benefit available to me in later years may be significantly reduced.




6


Nevertheless, I consent to the transfer of locked-in funds to a LIF, or the receipt of LIF-type payments directly from the pension plan, and certify that






(a)


I have read this form and understand it,






(b)


I have read the LIF transfer document and understand it,






(c)


neither my spouse nor anyone else has put any pressure on me to sign this form,






(d)


my spouse is not present while I am signing this form,






(e)


I realize that








(i)


this form gives only a general description of the legal rights I have under the

Pension Benefits Standards Act

and regulations, and








(ii)


if I wish to understand exactly what my legal rights are I must read the

Pension Benefits Standards Act

and regulations, and/or seek legal advice, and






(f)


I realize that I am entitled to a copy of this consent form, and a copy of the LIF contract.
