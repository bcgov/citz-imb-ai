77

(1)  If the administrator has knowledge or suspects that a
person is or is about to become indebted or liable to make a
payment to a producer, the administrator may demand that the
person pay all or part of the money otherwise payable to the
producer to the administrator on account of the producer's
liability under this Act.


(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), if the administrator
has knowledge or suspects that a person is about to advance money
to, or make a payment on behalf of, or make a payment in respect
of a negotiable instrument issued by a producer, the administrator
may demand that the person pay to the administrator on account of
the producer's liability under this Act the money that would
otherwise be advanced or paid.


(3)  If under this section the administrator demands that a
person pay to the administrator, on account of the liability under
this Act of a producer, money otherwise payable by that person to
the producer as interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an
annuity or other periodic payment, the demand


(a) applies to all of those payments to be made by the person
to the producer until the liability under this Act is satisfied,
and


(b) operates to require payments to the administrator, out of
each payment, of the amount stipulated by the administrator in
that demand.


(4)  Money or a beneficial interest in money in a savings
institution


(a) on deposit to the credit of a producer at the time a
demand is served, or


(b) deposited to the credit of a producer after a demand is
served


is money for which the savings institution is indebted to a
producer within the meaning of this section, but money on deposit
or deposited to the credit of a producer as described in paragraph
(a) or (b) does not include money on deposit or deposited to the
credit of a producer in the producer's capacity as a trustee.


(5)  A demand under this section continues in effect until

(a) the demand is satisfied, or

(b) 90 days after the demand is mailed or served,

whichever is earlier.

(6)  Despite subsection (5), a demand made in respect of a
periodic payment referred to in subsection (3) continues in effect
until it is satisfied unless no periodic payment is made or is
liable to be made within 90 days after the demand is mailed or
served, in which case the demand ceases to have effect on the
expiration of that period.


(7)  A person who fails to comply with a demand under
subsection (1) or (3) is liable to pay to the government an amount
equal to the amount that the person was required under subsection
(1) or (3), as the case may be, to pay to the administrator.


(8)  A person who fails to comply with a demand under
subsection (2) is liable to pay to the government an amount equal
to the lesser of


(a) the aggregate of the money advanced or paid, and


(b) the amount that the person was required under subsection
(2) to pay to the administrator.


(9)  The receipt of the administrator for money paid under
this section is a good and sufficient discharge of the original
liability to the extent of the payment.


(10)  Money paid by any person to the administrator in
compliance with a demand under this section is deemed to have been
paid by that person to the producer in respect of which the demand
was made.


(11)  If a person carries on business under a name or style
other than the person's own name, a demand under subsection (1),
(2) or (3) may be addressed to the name or style under which the
person carries on business and, in the case of personal service,
is deemed to be validly served if it is left with an adult person
employed at the addressee's place of business.


(12)  If persons carry on a business in partnership, a demand
under subsection (1), (2) or (3) may be addressed to the
partnership in its name and, in the case of personal service, is
deemed to be validly served if served on one of the partners or
left with an adult person employed at the partnership's place of
business.

produced at the well are not sufficient to pay all costs and
expenses of and incidental to the proceedings, investigations and
measures taken, and the minister directs that the balance of the
costs and expenses or any part of it is to be paid by the owner of
the well, then the provisions of section 106 regarding the
use of the deposit and regarding the further liability of the
owner of the well with respect to the costs referred to in that
section apply to the use of the deposit, and to the further
liability of the owner, to defray the balance of the costs and
