Requirements Applicable to All Disclosure




2.1


All disclosure of scientific or technical information made by an issuer, including disclosure of a mineral resource or mineral reserve, concerning a mineral project on a property material to the issuer must be based upon information prepared by or under the supervision of a qualified person.






All Disclosure of Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves




2.2


An issuer must not disclose any information about a mineral resource or mineral reserve unless the disclosure


(a) uses only the applicable mineral resource and mineral reserve categories set out in sections 1.2 and 1.3;


(b) reports each category of mineral resources and mineral reserves separately, and states the extent, if any, to which mineral reserves are included in total mineral resources;


(c) does not add inferred mineral resources to the other categories of mineral resources; and


(d) states the grade or quality and the quantity for each category of the mineral resources and mineral reserves if the quantity of contained metal or mineral is included in the disclosure.






Prohibited Disclosure




2.3


(1) 							An issuer must not make any disclosure of the


(a) quantity, grade, or metal or mineral content of a deposit that has not been categorized as an inferred mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource, a measured mineral resource, a probable mineral reserve or a proven mineral reserve; or


(b) results of an economic analysis that includes inferred mineral resources.


(2)
Despite paragraph (1) (a), an issuer may disclose in writing the potential quantity and grade, expressed as ranges, of a potential mineral deposit that is to be the target of further exploration if the disclosure


(a) includes a statement that the potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource; and


(b) states the basis on which the disclosed potential quantity and grade has been determined.


(3)
Despite paragraph (1) (b), an issuer may disclose a preliminary assessment that includes inferred mineral resources if


(a) the results of the preliminary assessment are a material change or a material fact with respect to the issuer; and


(b) the disclosure


(i)  includes a statement that the preliminary assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized; and


(ii)  states the basis for the preliminary assessment and any qualifications and assumptions made by the qualified person.


(4)
An issuer must not use the term preliminary feasibility study, pre-feasibility study or feasibility study when referring to a study unless the study satisfies the criteria set out in the definition of the applicable term in section 1.1.






Disclosure of Historical Estimates

INSTRUCTIONS:




(1) The objective of the technical report is to provide a summary of scientific and technical information concerning mineral exploration, development and production activities on a mineral property that is material to an issuer. This Form sets out specific requirements for the preparation and contents of a technical report.




(2) Terms used in this Form that are defined or interpreted in National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the "Instrument") will bear that definition or interpretation. In addition, a general definition instrument has been adopted as National Instrument 14-101 Definitions that contains definitions of certain terms used in more than one national instrument. Readers of this Form should review both these national instruments for defined terms.




(3) The qualified person preparing the technical report must use all of the headings of the items in this Form and may create sub-headings. If unique or infrequently used technical terms are required, clear and concise explanations must be included.




(4) No disclosure need be given in respect of inapplicable items and, unless otherwise required by this Form, negative answers to items may be omitted. Disclosure included under one heading is not required to be repeated under another heading.




(5) The technical report is not required to include the information required in Items 6 through 11 of this Form to the extent that the required information has been previously filed in a technical report for the property being reported on, the previous technical report is referred to in the technical report and there has not been any material change in the information.




(6) The technical report for development properties and production properties may summarize the information required in the items of this Form, except for Item 25, provided that the summary includes the material information necessary to understand the project at its current stage of development or production.




(7) The technical report may only contain disclaimers that are in accordance with section 6.4 of the Instrument and Item 5 of this Form.
