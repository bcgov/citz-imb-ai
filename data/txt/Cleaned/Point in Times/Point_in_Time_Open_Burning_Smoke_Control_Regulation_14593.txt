Open Burning Smoke Control Code of Practice




Part 1 — Purpose








Purpose





1



The purpose of this Code is to describe practices for open burning of debris that will reduce the health impact of smoke emissions and ensure that debris which is open burned is handled in an environmentally sound manner.








Application





2



(1)


While recognizing that fire is a natural part of many ecosystems and can be used as a tool to maintain plant diversity and animal life, this Code applies to fires used to manage ecosystems for purposes such as






(a)


silviculture management,






(b)


forest fuel management,






(c)


wildlife habitat enhancement, and






(d)


domestic range improvement.






(2)


This Code applies to debris disposal burning from operations such as land clearing and forest harvesting.






(3)


This Code does not apply to the following types of open burning:






(a)


the burning of leaves, foliage, weeds, crops or stubble for domestic or agricultural purposes or in compliance with the

Weed Control Act

;






(b)


fires set or controlled by a person acting under a notice of a designated forest official as that term is defined in the

Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act

, or under an order issued by a local assistant as that term is defined in the

Fire Services Act

.




Part 2 — Category Classification








Category A and B areas





3



(1)


Every place in British Columbia where smoke could have a high impact is designated in Schedule 1 as a Category A area.






(2)


Every place in British Columbia that is not in a Category A area is designated as a Category B area.








Change of category classification





4



(1)


A local government may request a change of category classification by making application to a director, after first having had a public consultation involving the local government, the stakeholders and other concerned persons and having passed a resolution that identifies the boundaries of the area to be changed.






(2)


After review of the application under subsection (1), the director of the Air Resources Branch may recommend to the Lieutenant Governor in Council that






(a)


a place that is in a Category B area be designated as a Category A area, or






(b)


a place that is in a Category A area be designated as a Category B area.




Part 3 — Smoke Emission Reduction Requirements








Duration of the smoke release from open burning





5



(1)


Within a Category A area, the smoke release period for each parcel of land must not be greater than 72 consecutive hours.






(2)


Repealed. [B.C. Reg. 262/98, s. 7 (b).]






(3)


Within a Category B area, the smoke release period for each parcel of land must not be greater than 96 consecutive hours. If, after 96 hours, smoke is being released from more than 5% of the debris that was initially ignited, the piled debris must be broken apart, scattered or re-piled. Portions of the piled debris still burning may be re-piled or used to ignite new piles of debris. Open burning initiated in this manner will be considered a new smoke release period and must comply with all the restriction of the regulations and this Code.






(4)


It is the responsibility of the person conducting the burn to ensure that satisfactory control of the feeding of the fire is maintained and that adequate equipment and staff are available to ensure that the limits set in this Code are followed.








Smoke free period





6



Within a Category A area, open burning of debris may proceed if no open burning has occurred on the parcel of land at any time during the 15 days preceding the open burning.








Burn periods per year





7



Within a Category A area, smoke may be released during open burning on a parcel of land on no more than 4 separate occasions during a calendar year.








Favourable weather for smoke dispersion





8



(1)


Unless otherwise specified for smoke management purposes in a burning permit issued by, or in a burn plan approved by, the ministry of the minister responsible for the administration of Part 3 of the

Forest and Range Practices Act

, open burning of debris must not be initiated unless the ventilation index is forecast as






(a)


"good" for the day the open burning is to be started, and






(b)


"good" or "fair" on the second day the debris is anticipated to release smoke.






(2)


If the ventilation index required by subsection (1) is not publicly available, a person who proposes to open burn debris must conduct a test burn, lasting no longer than 60 minutes, of sufficient debris on the site to evaluate the weather conditions so as to ensure that smoke from any subsequent open burning, initiated on the same day as the test burn, will not negatively impact on a nearby population or cause pollution.






(3)


Open burning of debris must not be initiated if the local air flow will cause the smoke to negatively impact on a nearby population or cause pollution.






(4)


Unless otherwise exempted for smoke management purposes by a burning permit issued by, or in a burn plan approved by, the ministry of the minister responsible for the administration of Part 3 of the

Forest and Range Practices Act

, open burning of debris must not be initiated if atmospheric mixing at the site where the debris is to be burned is insufficient to provide rapid dispersion of the smoke.








Smoke reduction if weather changes





9



Unless otherwise exempted for smoke management purposes by a burning permit issued by, or in a burn plan approved by, the ministry of the minister responsible for the administration of Part 3 of the

Forest and Range Practices Act

, debris must not be added to the open burn if






(a)


weather conditions change and the ventilation index becomes "poor",






(b)


local winds make the dispersion of the smoke inadequate, or






(c)


an inversion forms trapping smoke near the surface.
