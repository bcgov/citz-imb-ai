Remedy for lack of quorum




22


(1)
When the number of directors who, because of this Part, are disqualified from participating in a meeting is such that at that meeting the remaining directors are not of sufficient number to constitute a quorum, the corporation may apply to the court, without notice to any person, for an order authorizing the remaining directors to consider, discuss and vote on the matter out of which the pecuniary interest arises.


(2)
The court, on application under subsection (1) and after giving any direction as to service that the court considers appropriate, may declare that section 19 does not apply to the board of directors in respect of the matter in relation to which the application was brought, and the board of directors may then consider, discuss and vote on the matter in the same manner as though none of the directors had any pecuniary interest in the matter, subject only to any conditions and directions that the judge considers appropriate and orders.






Application to court




23


(1)
Subject to subsection (3), a resident of the region may, within 6 weeks after the resident becomes aware that a director may have contravened section 19, apply to the court in the manner prescribed by the Rules of Court for a determination of the question of whether the director has contravened section 19.

The applicant must state the grounds for alleging a contravention of section 19 by the director.


(3)

(a) must, subject to subsection (2), in the case of an individual currently holding office as a director, declare the office of the director vacant, and


(b) may, if the contravention has resulted in financial gain, require the individual to make restitution to the party suffering the loss or, if that party is not readily ascertainable, to the corporation.


(2)
If the court determines that an individual who is currently holding the office of director contravened section 19 and finds that the contravention was committed through inadvertence or because of a good faith error in judgment, the court need not declare that individual's office vacant under subsection (1).


(3)
An office declared vacant under subsection (1) must remain vacant if the decision to declare the office vacant is appealed and no appointment to fill the office may be made until the final determination of the matter or until the end of the director's term of office, whichever is earlier.






Proceedings voidable




25


The failure of an individual to comply with section 19 does not of itself invalidate any proceedings of the board of directors, but the proceedings are voidable at the instance of the board within 2 years after the date of the passing of the resolution in respect of which the failure occurred, unless invalidation of the proceedings would adversely affect the rights of another person who


(a) acquired those rights under or by virtue of the proceedings, and


(b) acted in good faith and without actual notice of the failure to comply with section 19.
