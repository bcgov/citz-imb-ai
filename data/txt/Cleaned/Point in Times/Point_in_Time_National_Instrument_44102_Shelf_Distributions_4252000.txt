At-the-market distributions of equity securities under shelf





9.1

Despite section 7.2 of NI 41-101, equity securities may be distributed by way of an at-the-market distribution using the shelf procedures if the market value of equity securities distributed does not exceed 10% of the aggregate market value of the issuer's outstanding equity securities of the same class as the class of securities distributed, calculated in accordance with section 9.2, as at the last trading day of the month before the month in which the first trade under the at-the-market distribution is made.






(2)


No underwriter or dealer distributing equity securities by way of an at-the-market distribution, or any affiliate of such an underwriter or dealer, or any person or company acting jointly or in concert with such an underwriter or dealer, shall, in connection with the distribution, over-allot the securities or effect a transaction that is intended to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities.






(3)


An issuer shall include in a base shelf prospectus or shelf prospectus supplement pertaining to an at-the-market distribution a statement that no underwriter or dealer involved in the distribution, no affiliate of such an underwriter or dealer and no person or company acting jointly or in concert with such an underwriter or dealer has over-allotted, or will over-allot, securities in connection with the distribution or effect any other transactions that are intended to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities.

Market value calculation





9.2



(1)


For the purposes of this Part,






(a)


the aggregate market value of the equity securities of an issuer on a date is the aggregate of the market value of each class of its equity securities on the date, calculated by multiplying






(i)


the total number of equity securities of the class outstanding on the date, by






(ii)


the closing price on the date of the equity securities of the class on the exchange in Canada on which that class of equity securities is principally traded; and






(b)


instalment receipts may, at the option of the issuer, be deemed to be equity securities if






(i)


the instalment receipts are listed and posted for trading on an exchange in Canada, and






(ii)


the outstanding equity securities, the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by the instalment receipts, are not listed and posted for trading on an exchange in Canada.






(2)


For the purposes of subsection (1), in calculating the total number of equity securities of a class outstanding, an issuer shall exclude those equity securities of the class that are beneficially owned, or controlled or directed, directly or indirectly, by persons or companies that, alone or together with their respective affiliates and associated parties, beneficially own, or control or direct, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the outstanding equity securities of the issuer.






(3)


Despite subsection (2), if a portfolio manager of a pension fund or investment fund, alone or together with its affiliates and associated parties, exercises control or direction, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate over more than 10% of the outstanding equity securities of an issuer, and the fund beneficially owns, or controls or directs, directly or indirectly, 10% or less of the issued and outstanding equity securities of the issuer, the securities that the fund beneficially owns, or controls or directs, directly or indirectly, are not excluded unless the portfolio manager is an affiliate of the issuer.
