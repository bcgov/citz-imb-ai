Supreme Court Civil Rules
Court Rules Act
1
The receiver and the surety hereby jointly and severally covenant
with Her Majesty the Queen in right of British Columbia that the
receiver will, from time to time, duly account for what the
receiver has already received since the date of the order
appointing the receiver and will hereafter receive or for what
since the date of the order the receiver has or will hereafter
become liable to pay or account for as receiver [
and manager
] and will pay every sum of money and deliver every property that
the court may direct.
2
If the receiver does not, for every successive 12 months
computed from the date of the receiver's appointment, pay at the
office of the surety the annual premium noted above, then the
surety may apply to be relieved from all further liability under
this guarantee, except in respect of any damage or loss occasioned
by any act or default of the receiver in relation to the
receiver's duties as receiver [
and manager
] prior to the hearing and determination of the application.
3
A statement under the hand of the registrar of the amount that the
receiver is liable to pay and has not paid under paragraph 1 and
that the loss or damage has been incurred through the act or
default of the receiver is conclusive evidence in any action by
Her Majesty against the receiver and surety, or either of them, or
by the surety against the receiver, of the truth of the contents
of the statement and constitutes a binding charge not only against
the receiver and the receiver's personal representatives, but also
against the surety and its funds and property without it being
necessary for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the
surety and the surety's funds and property and without it being
necessary for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the
receiver for the recovery thereof and without any further or other
proof being given in that behalf in any action to enforce this
guarantee.
4
The liability of the surety under this guarantee is limited to the
sum noted above, provided that the registrar may give his or her
approval in writing to the reduction of the liability of the
surety, in which event the surety's maximum liability with respect
to any acts or omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of
the approval is reduced accordingly and provided further that an
endorsement executed by the surety increasing the liability of the
surety will be binding on the surety with respect to any acts or
omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of that
endorsement.
5
The receiver will, on being discharged from office or on ceasing
to act as receiver [
and manager
], promptly give written notice of that discharge to the surety,
and also within 7 days after the notice give the surety a
copy of any order discharging the receiver.
6
The receiver and the receiver's personal representatives will at
all times hereafter indemnify the surety against all loss, damage,
costs, and expenses that the surety sustains by reason of the
surety having executed this guarantee.
