Water Act
Ground Water Protection Regulation
B.C. Reg. 299/2004
Water Act
Explanation
Optional
=
A closure plug is not required, but is recommended in cases
where there is a significant potential for contaminants to
enter the well either at the time of construction or at a
later date.
3 V
=
The length of the closure plug must be at least 3 feet, unless
a qualified professional who has competency in the field of
hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering or an engineer under
the
Water Act
confirms in writing that a lesser length will not
significantly increase the risk of a contaminant entering the
well or aquifer. In wells to be closed, the closure plug
should extend a minimum 3 feet below the base of any
excavation dug to remove the pitless adapter.
15 V
=
The length of the closure plug must be at least 15 feet,
unless a qualified professional who has competency in the
field of hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering or an
engineer under the
Water Act
confirms in writing that a lesser length will not
significantly increase the risk of a contaminant entering the
well or aquifer.
Retain
=
Keep a copy of the well closure report at least 5 years and
make it available on request.
Submit
=
Submit the final well closure report to the Comptroller of
Water Rights.
Note:
If it is not desirable to have the closure plug exposed at the
ground surface, the closure plug may extend to within 1 foot
of the ground surface to allow for 1 foot of backfill
materials but must still have a total length at least equal to
that specified in the Table.
