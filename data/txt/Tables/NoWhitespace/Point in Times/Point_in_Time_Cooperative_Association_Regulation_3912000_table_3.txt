1
The appeal of a termination of membership in a housing
cooperative is governed by the
Cooperative Association Act and Rule 49 of the Supreme Court
Rules.
If you wish to appeal the decision to terminate your
membership in the housing cooperative, you must first file a
Notice of Appeal (Form 59, attached) in a Supreme Court
registry within 30 days after the day you receive this Notice.
(If you do not know where nearest the court registry is,
consult the provincial government listings in the telephone
directory.)
4
Within 14 days after the date on which you file your Notice of
Appeal, you must inform the housing cooperative of your appeal
and the date scheduled for a hearing by serving a copy of the
Notice of Appeal on the housing cooperative. (The Notice of
Appeal may be served on the housing cooperative by leaving it
at its registered office; sending it by registered mail to the
registered office of the housing cooperative; personally
serving it on the directors or officers; or serving it in any
manner listed in Rule 11 of the Supreme Court Rules.)
5
You are advised to serve the Notice of Appeal on the housing
cooperative immediately after it has been filed. (The Supreme
Court Rules require that there must be at least 7 days between
the time the cooperative is served with a Notice of Appeal and
the day of the hearing.)
