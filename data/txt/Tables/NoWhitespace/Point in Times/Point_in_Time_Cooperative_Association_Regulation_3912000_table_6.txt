Cooperative Association Regulation
B.C. Reg. 391/2000
â€ .
The housing cooperative is required to pay the fee for filing
the Notice of Appeal if you are not in arrears for any monthly
housing charge. If there is a dispute about the amount of the
monthly housing charge the housing cooperative is still
required to pay the filing fee provided that you are not in
arrears for the amount of the monthly housing charge that is
not
in dispute.
You must make your request to the housing cooperative in
writing within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Right to
Appeal. If the housing cooperative pays the filing fee and you
are not successful in your appeal, the housing cooperative is
entitled to recover the amount of the filing fee from you.
If you are not eligible to require the housing cooperative to
pay the filing fee, you may wish to contact the Legal Services
Society for information about applying for legal aid or a
court registry for details as to how to apply for indigent
status. Since appeals must be commenced within 30 days after
the date you received this Notice, you are advised to
investigate the various options for payment of the filing fee
as soon as possible.
