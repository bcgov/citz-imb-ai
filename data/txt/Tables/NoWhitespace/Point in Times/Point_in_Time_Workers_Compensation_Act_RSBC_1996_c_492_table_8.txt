continued to be free from evidence of tuberculosis for 6
months after being so employed (except in primary tuberculosis
as proven by a negative tuberculin test at time of
employment). In the case of an employee previously compensated
for tuberculosis, any subsequent tuberculosis after the
disease has become inactive and has remained inactive for a
period of 3 years or more shall not be deemed to have occurred
as a result of the original disability for the purpose of the
Act, unless the worker is still engaged in employment listed
above or the board is satisfied that the subsequent
tuberculosis is the direct result of the tuberculosis for
which the worker has been compensated.
