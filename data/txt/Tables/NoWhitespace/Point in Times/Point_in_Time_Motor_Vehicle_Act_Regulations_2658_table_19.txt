(the "delivering carrier"), in addition to any other

jointly and severally liable with that other carrier for
that loss or damage.
Recovery from connecting carrier

The original contracting carrier or the delivering carrier,
as the case may be, is entitled to recover from any other
carrier to whom the goods are or have been delivered the
amount of loss or damage that the original contracting
carrier or delivering carrier, as the case may be, may be
required to pay under this bill of lading resulting from any
loss of or damage to the goods while they were in the
custody of such other carrier.
Remedy by consignor or consignee
Article 4:
Nothing in Article 2 or 3 deprives a consignor or a
consignee of any rights the consignor may have against any
carrier.
Exception from liability
Article 5:
The carrier is not liable for the following:
(a)
loss, damage or delay to any of the goods described in this
bill of lading caused by an Act of God, the Queen's or
public enemies, riots, strikes, a defect or inherent vice in
the goods, the act or default of the consignor, owner or
consignee, authority of law or quarantine;
(b)
unless caused by the negligence of the carrier or the
carrier's agent or employee:
(i)
damage to fragile articles that are not packed and unpacked
by the contracting carrier or by that carrier's agent or
employee(s);
(ii)
damage to the mechanical, electronic or other operations of
radios, phonographs, clocks, appliances, musical instruments
and other equipment, irrespective of who packed or unpacked

performed by the contracting carrier or by that carrier's
agent or employee(s);
(iii)
deterioration of or damage to perishable food, plants or
pets;

loss of contents of consignor packed articles, unless the
containers used are opened for the carrier's inspection and
articles are listed on this bill of lading and receipted for
by the carrier;
(c)
damage to or loss of a complete set or unit when only part
of such set is damaged or lost, in which event the carrier

damaged piece or pieces;
(d)
damage to the goods at place or places of pick-up at which
the consignor or the consignor's agent is not in attendance;
(e)
damage to the goods at place or places of delivery at which
the consignee or the consignee's agent is not in attendance
and cannot give receipt for goods delivered.
For the purpose of paragraph (b), the burden of proving
absence of negligence is on the carrier.
Delay
Article 6:
(a)
At the time of acceptance of the contract, the original
contracting carrier must provide the consignor with a date
or time period within which delivery is to be made. Failure
by the carrier to effect delivery within the time specified
on the face of the bill of lading renders the carrier liable
for reasonable food and lodging expenses incurred by the
consignee.
(b)
Failure by the consignee to accept delivery when tendered
within the time specified on the bill of lading renders the
consignee liable for reasonable storage in transit, handling
and redelivery charges incurred by the carrier.
Routing by the carrier
Article 7:
If, because of physical necessity, the carrier forwards the
goods by a conveyance that is not a licensed for hire
vehicle, the liability of the carrier is the same as though
the entire carriage were by licensed for hire vehicle.
Stoppage in transit
Article 8:
If goods are stopped or held in transit at the request of
the party entitled to so request, the goods are held at the
risk of that party.
Valuation
Article 9:
Subject to Article 10, the amount of any loss or damage for
which the carrier is liable, whether or not the loss or
damage results from negligence of the carrier or the
carrier's employees or agents, is to be computed on the
basis of the value of the lost or damaged article(s) at the
time and place of shipment.
Maximum liability
Article 10:
(a)
The amount of any loss or damage computed under Article 9
must not exceed the greater of
(i)
the value declared by the shipper, or
(ii)
$4.41 per kilogram computed on the total weight of the
shipment,
provided that if the consignor, in writing, releases the
shipment to a value of $1.32 per kilogram per article or
less the amount of any loss or damage computed under Article
9 must not exceed such lower amount.
(b)
If paragraph (a) (i) or (ii) applies, additional charges to
cover the additional coverage over $1.32 per kilogram per
article must be paid by the consignor.
Consignor's risk
Article 11:
If it is agreed that the goods are carried at the risk of
the consignor of the goods, that agreement covers only those
risks that are necessarily incidental to transportation and
the agreement does not relieve the carrier from liability
for any loss or damage or delay that may result from any
negligent act or omission of the carrier or the carrier's
agents or employees, and the burden of providing absence of
negligence is on the carrier.
Notice of claim
Article 12:
(a)
A carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay to any
goods carried under this bill of lading unless notice of the
loss, damage or delay setting out particulars of the origin,
destination and date of shipment of the goods and the
estimated amount claimed in respect of such loss, damage or
delay is given in writing to the original contracting
carrier or the delivering carrier within 60 days after
delivery of the goods, or, in the case of failure to make
delivery, within 9 months after the date of shipment.
(b)
The final statement of the claim must be filed within 9
months after the date of shipment.
(c)
Either the original contracting carrier or the delivering
carrier, as the case may be, must acknowledge receipt of
claim within 30 days after receipt of the claim.
Articles of extraordinary value
Article 13:
A carrier is not bound to carry any documents, specie or any
articles of extraordinary value unless by a special
agreement to do so. If such goods are carried without a
special agreement and the nature of the goods is not
disclosed on the face of this bill of lading, the carrier is
not liable for any loss or damage.
Freight charges
Article 14:
(a)
If required by the carrier, the freight and all other lawful
charges accruing on the goods must be paid before delivery,
provided that, if the total actual charges exceed by more
than 10% the total estimated charges, the consignee must be
allowed 15 days after the day on which the goods are
delivered (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) to pay
the amount by which the total actual charges exceed 110% of
the total estimated charges.
(b)
The 15 days extension provided in paragraph (a) does not
apply if the carrier notified the consignor of the total
actual charges immediately after the goods are loaded, or if
the carrier receives a waiver of the extension provision
signed by the consignor.
Dangerous goods
Article 15:
Every person, whether as principal or agent, shipping
explosives or dangerous goods without previous full
disclosure to the carrier as required by law, must indemnify
the carrier against all loss, damage or delay caused by
those explosives or dangerous goods, and such goods may be
warehoused at the consignor's risk and expense.
Undelivered goods
Article 16:
(a)
If, through no fault of the carrier, the goods cannot be
delivered, the carrier must immediately give notice to the
consignor and consignee that delivery has not been made, and
must request disposal instructions.
(b)
Pending receipt of such disposal instructions,
(i)
the goods may be stored in the warehouse of the carrier,
subject to a reasonable charge for storage, or
(ii)
provided that the carrier has notified the consignor of the
carrier's intention, the goods may be removed to, and stored
in, a public or licensed warehouse, at the expense of the
consignor, without liability on the part of the carrier, and
subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful charges,
including a reasonable charge for storage.
Alterations
Article 17:
Subject to Article 18, any additional limitation on the
carrier's liability on the bill of lading, and any
alteration or addition or erasure on the bill of lading,
must be signed or initialed by the consignor or the
consignor's agent and the original contracting carrier or
that carrier's agent and unless so acknowledged is without
effect.
Weights
Article 18:
It is the responsibility of the original contracting carrier
or that carrier's agent to show the correct tare, gross and
net weights on this bill of lading by use of a certified
public scale, and attach the weigh scale ticket to the
original contracting carrier or that carrier's agent's copy
of this bill of lading. If certified public scales are not
available at origin or at any point within a radius of 16
kilometres of that point, a constructive weight based on 112
kilograms per cubic metre of properly loaded van space must
be used.
