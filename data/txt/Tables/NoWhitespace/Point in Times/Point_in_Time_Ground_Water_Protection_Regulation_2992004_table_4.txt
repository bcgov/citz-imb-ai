Water Act
Explanation
Optional
=
A surface seal is not required but is recommended in cases
where there is a significant potential for contaminants to
enter the well either at the time of drilling or at a later
date.
3 V
=
The length of the surface seal must be at least 3 feet, unless
a qualified professional who has competency in the field of
hydrogeology or geotechnical engineering or an engineer under
the Water Act confirms in writing that a lesser length will
not significantly increase the risk of a contaminant entering
the well or aquifer.
Note:
If it is not desirable to have the sealant exposed at the
ground surface, the sealant may extend to within 1 foot of the
ground surface to allow for 1 foot of backfill materials but
must still have a total length at least equal to that
specified in the Table.
