Motor Vehicle Act Regulations
Motor Vehicle Act
Article 1:
The carrier of the goods described in this bill of lading is
liable for any loss or damage to the goods accepted by the carrier
or the carrier's agent except as provided in these Articles.
Article 2:
In the case of a shipment handled by 2 or more carriers, the
carrier issuing the bill of lading (the "originating carrier"),
and the carrier who assumes responsibility for delivery to the
consignee (the "delivering carrier"), in addition to any other
liability under these Articles, are, if the goods being
transported are lost or damaged while they are in the custody of
any other carrier to whom these goods are or have been delivered,
jointly and severally liable with that other carrier for that loss
or damage.
Article 3:
The originating carrier or the delivering carrier, as the case may
be, is entitled to recover from any other carrier to whom the
goods are or have been delivered the amount of the loss or damage
that the originating carrier or delivering carrier, as the case
may be, may be required to pay under these Articles resulting from
loss or damage to the goods while they were in the custody of such
other carrier.
Article 4:
Nothing in Article 2 or 3 deprives a consignor or a consignee of
any remedy or right of action that the consignor or consignee may
have against any carrier.
Article 5:
The carrier is not liable for
(a)
loss, damage or delay to any of the goods described in this bill
of lading because of an act of God, the King's or public
enemies, riots, strikes or a defect or inherent vice in the
goods being transported, or
(b)
loss or damage resulting from the act or default of the
consignor, the owner of the goods or the consignee, the
authority of law, quarantine or differences in weights of grain,
seed or other commodities caused by natural shrinkage.
Article 6:
The carrier is not bound to transport the goods referred to in
this bill of lading by any particular vehicle or in time for any
particular market or otherwise than with due dispatch unless by
agreement specifically endorsed on this bill of lading and signed
by the parties to it.
Article 7:
In case of physical necessity, the carrier has the right to
forward the said goods by any conveyance or route between the
point of shipment and the point of destination, but the liability
of the carrier remains the same as though the entire carriage were
by highway.
Article 8:
If goods are stopped and held in transit at the request of a party
entitled to make such request, the goods are held at the risk of
that party.
Article 9:
Subject to Article 10, the amount of any loss or damage for which
the carrier is liable, whether or not such loss or damage results
from negligence, is to be computed on the basis of the value of
the goods at the place and time of shipment (including the freight
and other charges if paid and the duty if paid or payable and not
refundable) unless a lower value has been represented in writing
by the consignor or has been agreed on between the parties to this
bill of lading, or is determined by the classification or tariff
on which the rate is based, in any of which events such lower
value is the amount that governs the computation of the maximum
liability of the carrier.
Article 10:
The amount of any loss or damage computed under Article 9
must not exceed $4.41 per kg ($2 per lb),
computed on the total weight of the shipment, unless a higher
value is declared on the face of the bill of lading by the
consignor.
Article 11:
If it is agreed between the parties that goods are to be carried
at the risk of the consignor, that agreement covers only those
risks that are necessarily incidental to transportation and does
not relieve the carrier from liability for any loss or damage or
delay that may result from any negligent act or omission of the
carrier or the carrier's agents or employees, and the burden of
proving freedom from that negligence or omission is on the
carrier.
Article 12a:
The carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay to any of the
goods transported under this bill of lading unless notice of the
loss, damage or delay, setting out particulars of the origin,
destination and date of shipment of the goods and the estimated
amount claimed in respect of such loss, damage or delay, is given
in writing to the originating carrier (or the delivering carrier)
within 60 days after the delivery of the goods, or, in the
case of failure to make delivery, within 9 months after the
date of shipment of the goods.
Article 12b:
The final statement of the claim must be filed within
9 months after the date of shipment, together with a copy of
the paid freight bill.
Article 13:
A carrier is not bound to carry any documents, specie or any
articles of extraordinary value unless by special agreement to do
so. If such goods are carried without a special agreement and the
nature of the goods is not disclosed in this bill of lading, the
carrier is not liable for any loss or damage in excess of the
maximum liability stipulated in Article 10 of these
Conditions of Carriage.
Article 14a:
If required by the carrier, the freight and all other lawful
charges accruing on the goods must be paid before delivery, and if
on inspection it is ascertained that the goods shipped are not
those described in this bill of lading, the freight charges must
be paid on the goods actually shipped, with any additional charges
lawfully payable on those goods.
Article 14b:
Should the consignor fail to indicate on this bill of lading that
a shipment is to be transported prepaid, or should the consignor
fail to indicate the basis on which the shipment is to be
transported, the carrier is entitled to transport the shipment on
a freight collect basis.
Article 15:
Every person, whether as principal or agent, shipping explosives
or dangerous goods without previous full disclosure to the carrier
or its agent of the nature of such goods is liable for all loss or
damage caused by those explosives or dangerous goods and such
goods may be warehoused at the consignor's risk and expense.
Article 16:
If, through no fault of the carrier, goods cannot be delivered,
the carrier after having given notice to the consignor and the
consignee that delivery has not been made, and after requesting
disposal instructions, may, pending receipt of such disposal
instructions, store the goods in the warehouse of the carrier
subject to a reasonable charge for storage, or, after notifying
the consignor of the carrier's intention, may cause the goods to
be removed to and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the
expense of the consignor without liability on the part of the
carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful
charges, including a reasonable charge for storage.
Article 17:
If notice has been given by the carrier under Article 16 and
no disposal instructions have been received within 10 days
after the date of that notice, the carrier may return to the
consignor at the consignor's expense all undelivered shipments
with respect to which the notice has been given.
Article 18:
Subject to Article 19, any alteration, addition or erasure in
the bill of lading must be signed or initialled by the consignor
or the consignor's agent and the originating carrier or that
carrier's agent, and unless so acknowledged is without effect, and
this bill of lading is enforceable according to its original
tenor.
Article 19:
It is the responsibility of the consignor to show correct shipping
weights of the shipment on the bill of lading if completed by the
consignor. Despite Article 18, failure to do this makes the
bill of lading subject to correction in this respect by the
carrier.
