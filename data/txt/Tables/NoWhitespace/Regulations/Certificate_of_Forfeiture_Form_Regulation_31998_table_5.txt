Certificate of Forfeiture Form Regulation
Mineral Land Tax Act
I hereby certify that on ....................................... I
gave notice under s. 13 of the
Mineral Land Tax Act
, that unless the delinquent mineral land taxes, interest and
penalties were fully paid within 90 days from the date the notice
was published in the Gazette, the minerals and the right to work,
win or carry away the minerals located in, under or on the mineral
land (described above), would be absolutely forfeited to the Crown
in the right of the Province of British Columbia. As the
delinquent mineral land taxes, interest and penalties were not
fully paid within the 90 day period, and are still not fully paid,
the minerals and the right to work, win and carry away the
minerals located in, under or on the mineral land are absolutely
forfeited to and vested in the Crown in the right of the Province
of British Columbia free and clear of all encumbrances.
