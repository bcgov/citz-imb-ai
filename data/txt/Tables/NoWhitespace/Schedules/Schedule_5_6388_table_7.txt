Hazardous Waste Regulation
Environmental Management Act
Note:
A generator ordinarily generates and stores hazardous waste
onsite and ships the hazardous waste to a management or
disposal facility. However, some generator facilities may also
be management facilities. If a generator facility is also a
management facility, the generator must also complete Part C.
