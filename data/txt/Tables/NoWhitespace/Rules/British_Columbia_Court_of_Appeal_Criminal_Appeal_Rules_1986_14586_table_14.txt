(PART 2 - Exhibits and Affidavits: This Part shall contain
each document in the order that it was filed. Unless
something turns on the document itself, cheques, notes,
bills and other similar documents need not be reproduced
so long as their effect is stated. Documents having common
characteristics shall be arranged in separate groups in
order of their dates, and exhibits and affidavits to be
reproduced in facsimile may, if numerous or of a special
size, be grouped together.
Where evidence from the matter under appeal consisted of
affidavit evidence, all affidavits shall be reproduced in
this Part.)
