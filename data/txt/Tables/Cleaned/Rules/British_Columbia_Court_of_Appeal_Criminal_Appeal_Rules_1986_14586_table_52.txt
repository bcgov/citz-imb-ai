3.


If the appellant wishes to appeal against conviction, he must
write the word "conviction". If he wishes to appeal against
sentence, he must write the word "sentence". If he wishes to
appeal against both conviction and sentence he must write the
words "conviction and sentence". If an appellant convicted of more
than one offence wishes to appeal against only some of the
convictions or sentences, he must state clearly the convictions or
sentences against which he wishes to appeal.
