Table 26-6: Requirements for radio controlled carriages




• These carriages are fitted with and controlled by an onboard
computerized radio control system. This radio system is operated
independently through a transmitter separated from that of the
yarder.




• The yarding and carriage frequencies must be separate,
registered and coordinated through the WCB co-ordination system to
ensure that one does not interfere with the other or with another
operation. Contact the WCB for more information.




• An audible signal must be sounded at the carriage and not at the
yarder. This signal must have a tone different from that of the
yarder signal.




• Standard skyline signals will apply at the yarder.
