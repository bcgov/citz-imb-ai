1

Energy Storage Facilities.









Criteria:


(1)

Subject to subsection (2),




(a)

a new liquefied natural gas facility with the design
capacity to store ≥ 136 000 m
3
of liquefied natural gas, or




(b)

any other energy storage facilities for a project with a
total design capacity to store one or more energy
resources in a quantity that can yield by combustion
≥ 3 PJ of energy.



(2)

Development or use of naturally occurring underground
reservoirs for the storage of petroleum or natural gas
is not reviewable under subsection (1) if those
reservoirs are located in the Western Canadian
Sedimentary Basin of northeast British Columbia within
the map groups and blocks set out in Appendix 2.









Criteria:


(1)

Subject to subsections (2) and (3), modification of an
existing project if




(a)

the existing project, or the project after modification,
were it a new project, would meet the criteria set out
opposite in Column 2, and




(b)

the modification results in an increase in the
capability of the project to store one or more energy
resources, other than electricity, by a quantity that
can yield by combustion ≥ 3 PJ of energy or,
for liquefied natural gas, increase by
≥ 136 000 m
3
.



(2)

Replacement of project components solely for maintenance
purposes is not reviewable under subsection (1).



(3)

Development or use of naturally occurring underground
reservoirs for the storage of petroleum or natural gas
is not reviewable under subsection (1) if those
reservoirs are located in the Western Canadian
Sedimentary Basin of northeast British Columbia within
the map groups and blocks set out in Appendix 2.











2

Oil Refineries.









Criteria:


(1)

A new project, including a heavy oil upgrader, with an
input capacity of ≥ 10 000 m
3
/day.









Criteria:


(1)

Modification of an existing project that would result in
an increase in input capacity of ≥ 50% and total
input capacity of ≥ 10 000 m
3
/day.











3

Natural Gas Processing Plants.









Criteria:


(1)

A new natural gas processing plant facility that will
result in sulphur emissions to the atmosphere of
≥ 2 tonnes/day.









Criteria:


(1)

Modification of an existing facility if




(a)

the existing facility, or the existing facility after
modification, were it a new facility, would meet the
criteria set out opposite in Column 2, and




(b)

the modification results in an incremental increase in
sulphur emissions to the atmosphere of
≥ 2 tonnes/day.











4

Transmission Pipelines.









Criteria:


(1)

Subject to subsection (2), a new transmission pipeline
facility with




(a)

a diameter of ≤ 114.3 mm and a length of
≥ 60 km,




(b)

a diameter of between 114.3 and 323.9 mm and a
length of ≥ 50 km, or




(c)

a diameter of > 323.9 mm and a length of
≥ 40 km,





if the land on which the pipeline is built is not
alongside and contiguous to an area of land previously
developed for a transmission line, transmission
pipeline, public highway or railway.



(2)

Assessment of a new facility under subsection (1) does
not include the dismantling and abandonment phases.









Criteria:


(1)

Subject to subsections (2), modification of an existing
facility if




(a)

the existing facility, or the existing facility after
modification, were it a new facility, would meet the
criteria set out opposite in Column 2, and




(b)

the modification results in




(i)

for a facility that when modified will have a diameter
of < 114.3 mm, an extension of
≥ 60 km in length on land, in which the
modified pipeline is built, that is not alongside and
contiguous to an area of land previously developed for a
transmission line, transmission pipeline, public highway
or railway,




(ii)

for a facility that when modified will have a diameter
of between 114.3 and 323.9 mm, an extension of
≥ 50 km in length on land, in which the
modified pipeline is built, that is not alongside and
contiguous to an area of land previously developed for a
transmission line, transmission pipeline, public highway
or railway




(iii)

for a facility that when modified will have a diameter
of > 323.9 mm, an extension of
≥ 40 km in length on land, in which the
modified pipeline is built, that is not alongside and
contiguous to an area of land previously developed for a
transmission line, transmission pipeline, public highway
or railway.



(2)

Assessment of the modification of an existing facility
described in subsection (1) does not include the
dismantling and abandonment phases.











5

Offshore Oil or Gas Facilities.









Criteria:


(1)

A new offshore oil or gas facility.









Criteria:


(1)

Modification of an existing facility if




(a)

the existing facility, or the existing facility after
modification, were it a new facility, would meet the
criteria set out opposite in Column 2, and




(b)

the chief executive assessment officer has determined
that the modification has the potential to result in a
significant adverse environmental, economic, social,
cultural or health effect.
