If a CPRC indicates that there is reason to believe that a child

child welfare worker conducting the CPRC will make a report to a
local child welfare worker for further assessment under the CFCSA.

If a CPRC indicates that the applicant currently has an open child
protection file, the delegated child welfare worker conducting the
CPRC will notify the child welfare worker with conduct of the open
file that the applicant is seeking guardianship under the FLA.

In response to a CPRC, a judge may order that records under the
CFCSA or predecessor legislation be provided to the court.

applicant's ability and willingness to satisfy the needs of the
child under section 211 of the FLA.

The director of the CFCSA may apply for leave to intervene in the
guardianship proceedings under the FLA if the director considers
