Hazardous Waste Facilities









Criteria:


(1)

Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a project




(a)

for the storage, treatment or disposal of biomedical
waste or hazardous waste if the proposal




(i)

entails facilities of a type specified under subsection
(2), and




(ii)
is for



(A)

construction of a new facility, or




(B)

modification of an existing facility for which the
storage, treatment or disposal of biomedical waste or
hazardous waste has not previously been permitted under
the
Environmental Management Act
, or




(b)

to use hazardous waste at an existing off-site facility
whose principal function is not waste management, and
that has not previously been permitted to use that type
of hazardous waste under the
Environmental Management Act
, if there will be




(i)

off-site use of hazardous waste by combustion or thermal
processes, or




(ii)

off-site use of hazardous waste other than by combustion
or thermal processes if




(A)

one type of hazardous waste listed in Column I of Table
1 of Schedule 6 of the Hazardous Waste Regulation, B.C.
Reg. 63/88, is to be used and the daily maximum use is
≥ 1 000 times greater than the registration
quantity listed in Column II of that table, or




(B)

more than one type of hazardous waste listed in
Column I of Table 1 of Schedule 6 of the Hazardous
Waste Regulation, B.C. Reg. 63/88, is to be used and the
cumulative maximum design use is
≥ 100 000 kg/day or
≥ 100 000 litres/day, as appropriate.



(2)

Subsection (1) (a) applies to the following types of
facilities:




(a)

an off-site incinerator or thermal treatment facility,
excluding




(i)

a thermal treatment facility that uses non-combustion
technologies for the disinfection or sterilization of
biomedical waste, or




(ii)

an incinerator or thermal treatment facility that uses
combustion or other related technologies for the
treatment or disposal of biomedical waste, and that has
a capacity of < 5 tonnes/day;




(b)

an off-site secure building or secure landfill;




(c)

an off-site treatment facility, other than an
incinerator, thermal treatment facility or land
treatment facility,




(i)

if one type of hazardous waste listed in Column I
of Table 1 of Schedule 6 of the Hazardous Waste
Regulation, B.C. Reg. 63/88, is to be treated, and
the daily maximum design treatment capacity is
≥ 1 000 times greater than the registration
quantity listed in Column II of that table, or




(ii)

if more than one type of hazardous waste listed in
Column I of Table 1 of Schedule 6 of the Hazardous Waste
Regulation, B.C. Reg. 63/88, is to be treated, and
the cumulative maximum design treatment capacity is
≥ 100 000 kg/day or
≥ 100 000 litres/day, as appropriate.



(3)

The following are not reviewable under subsections (1)
and (2):




(a)

a facility for the treatment of a hazardous waste that
does not use or propose to use incineration or thermal
treatment if the facility is




(i)

a mobile off-site treatment facility, or




(ii)

a research and demonstration facility;




(b)

a facility for the thermal treatment of drilling mud in
a closed-loop unit if the facility is located at




(i)

a drilling rig site, or




(ii)

a secure landfill;




(c)

discharge to an underground formation, in accordance
with the
Oil and Gas Activities Act
, of




(i)

produced water, or




(ii)

fluids recovered from a well completion or workover;




(d)

any treatment authorized by Part 6 of the Hazardous
Waste Regulation, B.C. Reg. 63/88.









Criteria:


(1)

Subject to subsection (2), modification of an existing
hazardous waste facility if




(a)

the existing facility, or the facility after
modification, were it a new facility, would meet the
criteria set out opposite in Column 2, and




(b)

the modification results in an increase of ≥ 30% in
the total waste discharge from the facility.



(2)

The following are not reviewable under
subsection (1):




(a)

a facility for the treatment of a hazardous waste that
does not use or propose to use incineration or thermal
treatment if the facility is




(i)

a mobile off-site treatment facility, or




(ii)

a research and demonstration facility;




(b)

a facility for the thermal treatment of drilling mud in
a closed-loop unit if the facility is located at




(i)
a drilling pad, or



(ii)
a secure landfill;



(c)

discharge to an underground formation, in accordance
with the
Oil and Gas Activities Act
, of




(i)
produced water, or



(ii)

fluids recovered from a well completion or workover;




(d)

any treatment authorized by Part 6 of the Hazardous
Waste Regulation, B.C. Reg. 63/88.
