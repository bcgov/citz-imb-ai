(c).


A Dam Safety Review involves collection of all available dam
records, field inspections, detailed investigations and
possibly laboratory testing. It then proceeds with a check of
structural stability and operational safety of the dam,
beginning with a reappraisal of basic features and
assumptions. The level of detail required in a Dam Safety
Review should be commensurate with the importance and
complexity of the dam, as well as the consequences of failure.
