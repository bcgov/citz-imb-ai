            If the appellant wishes to appeal against conviction, he must write
            the word "conviction". If he wishes to appeal against sentence, he
            must write the word "sentence". If he wishes toÂ  appeal against both
            conviction and sentence he must write the words "conviction and
            sentence". If an appellant convicted of more than one offence wishes
            to appeal against only some of the convictions or sentences, he must
            state clearly the convictions or sentences against which he wishes
            to appeal.
