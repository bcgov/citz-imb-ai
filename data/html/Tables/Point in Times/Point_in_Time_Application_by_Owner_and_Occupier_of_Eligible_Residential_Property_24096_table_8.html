              What Assessment Relief is Provided Under Section 19 (8) of the
              <em> Assessment Act </em>
              ?
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            This section of the
            <em> Assessment Act </em>
            allows residential property to be assessed at a lower value if the
            owner qualifies and the property has potential for development.
            <br />
            <br />
            Section 19 (8) deals with a residential property's existing use
            versus its potential use. Over time, property tends to be
            redeveloped into different uses, particularly residential property
            that is close to urban areas.
            <br />
            <br />
            Examples of residential property with the potential for development
            are:
            <br />
            <br />
            • a house located on land that has been rezoned for commercial use
            (e.g., allowing for a store or office building), or
            <br />
            • a house located on a five-acre parcel which could be developed
            into one-quarter acre lots.
            <br />
            <br />
            Both examples could qualify for assessment relief.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong> Who Qualifies for Assessment Relief? </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Residential property owners who have been living on property which
            is less than 2.03 hectares (approximately 5 acres) for more than 10
            years, may be eligible for a lower property assessment.
            <br />
            <br />
            To qualify for assessment relief:
            <br />
            <br />
            • the property must be the property owner's principal residence.
            <br />
            • the owner must have owned and occupied the property continuously
            for at least 10 years. In other words, to qualify for assessment
            relief
            <u> next year </u>
            an owner must have owned and occupied their property for at least 10
            years ending October 31 of
            <u> this year </u>
            .
          </td>
          <td colname="c2" valign="top">
            • the property's market value for another use must be higher than
            the property's existing residential value.
            <br />
            • a completed application form must be submitted each year.
            <br />
            • additional qualifying criteria may be required.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong> Who Benefits from Assessment Relief? </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Property owners living in communities or neighbourhoods where land
            use is changing would benefit from assessment relief. If eligible,
            the property owner's property will be valued at its current
            "existing" use instead of its higher "potential" use.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
              Do All Long Term Property Owners Qualify for Assessment Relief?
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            No. To qualify, the property's
            <u> demonstrated </u>
            market value must be higher than its current residential value. For
            example, a home in a large residential subdivision, surrounded by
            other residential dwellings, might not qualify for relief under this
            section of the
            <em> Assessment Act </em>
            simply because the current use reflects the most valuable use of the
            property.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
              How Do Property Owners Apply for Assessment Relief?
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Owners must apply to their local assessment office each year.
            <br />
            <br />
            Owners are advised to file their applications for assessment relief
            at their local BC Assessment office by January 31 of each year. This
            will ensure consideration for the current Assessment Roll.
            <strong>
              <em>
                Note: A new application form must be completed each year.

              How Do I Get More Information on Assessment Relief?
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Application forms and additional information on assessment relief
