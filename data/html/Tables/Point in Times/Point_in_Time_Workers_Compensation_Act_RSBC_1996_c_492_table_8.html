            continued to be free from evidence of tuberculosis for 6 months
            after being so employed (except in primary tuberculosis as proven by
            a negative tuberculin test at time of employment). In the case of an
            employee previously compensated for tuberculosis, any subsequent
            tuberculosis after the disease has become inactive and has remained
            inactive for a period of 3 years or more shall not be deemed to have
            occurred as a result of the original disability for the purpose of
            the Act, unless the worker is still engaged in employment listed
            above or the board is satisfied that the subsequent tuberculosis is
            the direct result of the tuberculosis for which the worker has been
            compensated.
