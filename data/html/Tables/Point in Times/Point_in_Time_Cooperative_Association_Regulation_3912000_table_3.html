            The appeal of a termination of membership in a housing cooperative
            is governed by the
            <em>
              Cooperative Association Act and Rule 49 of the Supreme Court
              Rules.
            </em>
            If you wish to appeal the decision to terminate your membership in
            the housing cooperative, you must first file a Notice of Appeal
            (Form 59, attached) in a Supreme Court registry within 30 days after
            the day you receive this Notice. (If you do not know where nearest
            the court registry is, consult the provincial government listings in
            the telephone directory.)

            Within 14 days after the date on which you file your Notice of
            Appeal, you must inform the housing cooperative of your appeal and
            the date scheduled for a hearing by serving a copy of the Notice of
            Appeal on the housing cooperative. (The Notice of Appeal may be
            served on the housing cooperative by leaving it at its registered
            office; sending it by registered mail to the registered office of
            the housing cooperative; personally serving it on the directors or
            officers; or serving it in any manner listed in Rule 11 of the
            Supreme Court Rules.)

            You are advised to serve the Notice of Appeal on the housing
            cooperative immediately after it has been filed. (The Supreme Court
            Rules require that there must be at least 7 days between the time
            the cooperative is served with a Notice of Appeal and the day of the
            hearing.)
