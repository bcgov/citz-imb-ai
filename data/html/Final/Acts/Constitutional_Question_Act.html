               If in a cause, matter or other proceeding to which this section applies the
          Attorney General of Canada appears, the Attorney General of Canada is a party and, for the
          purpose of an appeal from an adjudication respecting the validity or applicability of a
          law, or respecting entitlement to a constitutional remedy, has the same rights as any
          other party.

               The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to entertain an action at the instance of
          either the Attorney General of Canada or the Attorney General of British Columbia for a
          declaration as to the validity of an Act of the Legislature, though no further relief is
          sought.
