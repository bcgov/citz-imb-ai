          Without limiting section 26 (1), the Lieutenant Governor in Council
          may make regulations respecting any matters that, in the opinion of
          the Lieutenant Governor in Council, are insufficiently provided for,
          or not provided for, in sections 27 to 29 and that are necessary for
          the orderly transition from the application of the former Act to its
          replacement by this Act.
