        <p>
          WHEREAS the recognition and reconciliation of the prior presence of
          Aboriginal peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of
          significant social and economic importance to all British Columbians;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is
          best achieved through negotiation and agreement, rather than through
          litigation;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS, in order to achieve this reconciliation, representatives
          of the Tla'amin Nation, Canada and British Columbia have negotiated
          the Tla'amin Final Agreement in a process facilitated by the British
          Columbia Treaty Commission;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS British Columbia is building a New Relationship with First
          Nations and working to close the social and economic gaps that exist
          between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Tla'amin Final Agreement embodies the principles of
          this New Relationship, including mutual respect, recognition and
          reconciliation of Aboriginal rights and title;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Tla'amin Final Agreement requires that British
          Columbia enact legislation to give effect to the Tla'amin Final
          Agreement;
        </p>
        <p>

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        44. The purpose of the modification referred to in paragraph 42 is to
        ensure that as of the Effective Date:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the Tla'amin Nation has, and can exercise, Tla'amin Section 35 Rights
        as set out in this Agreement, including the attributes and geographic
        extent of those rights, and the limitations to those rights, to which
        the Parties have agreed;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. Canada, British Columbia and all other persons can exercise their
        rights, authorities, jurisdictions and privileges in a manner consistent
        with this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. Canada, British Columbia and all other persons do not have any
        obligations in relation to any of the Tla'amin Nation's aboriginal
        rights, including aboriginal title, to the extent that they might be in
        any way other than, or different in attributes or geographic extent
        from, Tla'amin Section 35 Rights as set out in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        45. For greater certainty, any aboriginal rights, including aboriginal
        title, that the Tla'amin Nation may have are not extinguished, but are
        modified and continue as modified as set out in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> Release of Past Claims </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        46. The Tla'amin Nation releases Canada, British Columbia and all other
        persons from all claims, demands, actions or proceedings, of whatever
        kind, whether known or unknown, that the Tla'amin Nation ever had, now
        has or may have in the future, relating to or arising from any act or
        omission before the Effective Date that may have affected, interfered
        with or infringed any of the Tla'amin Nation's aboriginal rights,
        including aboriginal title, in Canada.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        47. The Tla'amin Nation will indemnify and save harmless Canada or

        Effective Date that may have affected or infringed any of the Tla'amin
        Nation's aboriginal rights, including aboriginal title, in Canada.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        48. The Tla'amin Nation will indemnify and save harmless Canada or

        that Canada, or British Columbia, respectively, may suffer or incur in

        aboriginal right, including aboriginal title, of the Tla'amin Nation in
        Canada that is other than, or different in attributes or geographical
        extent from, Tla'amin Section 35 Rights as set out in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        49. A Party who is the subject of a claim, demand, action or proceeding

      <p align="left">
        <strong> SPECIFIC CLAIMS </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        50. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Tla'amin Nation from
        pursuing any claims, including any claims respecting Teeskwat, that fall
        within the scope of Canada's Specific Claims Policy, in accordance with
        that policy, the
        <em> Specific Claims Tribunal Act </em>
        or in court. For greater certainty, if the Tla'amin Nation pursues a
        specific claim in court, Canada reserves the right to plead all defenses
        available to it including limitation periods, laches and lack of
        admissible evidence.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        51. For greater certainty, the Tla'amin Nation's claims referred to in
        paragraph 50 will not result in any land being declared to be, or being
        set aside as, "Lands reserved for the Indians" within the meaning of the
        <em> Constitution Act, 1867 </em>
        for the Tla'amin Nation or an Indian Reserve for the use and benefit of
        the Tla'amin Nation.

        <strong> OTHER ABORIGINAL PEOPLE </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        52. Nothing in this Agreement affects, recognizes or provides any rights
        under section 35 of the

        for any aboriginal people other than the Tla'amin Nation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        53. Where a superior court of a province, the Federal Court of Canada or
        the Supreme Court of Canada finally determines that any aboriginal
        people, other than the Tla'amin Nation, have rights under section 35 of
        the
        <em> Constitution Act, 1982 </em>
        that are adversely affected by a provision of this Agreement:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the provision will operate and have effect to the extent that it does
        not adversely affect those rights; and

      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. where the provision cannot operate and have effect in a way that it
        does not adversely affect those rights, the Parties will make best
        efforts to amend this Agreement to remedy or replace the provision.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        54. Where Canada or British Columbia enters into a treaty or a land
        claims agreement, within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 of the
        <em> Constitution Act, 1982 </em>
        , with another aboriginal people, and that treaty or land claims
        agreement adversely affects Tla'amin Section 35 Rights as set out in
        this Agreement, Canada or British Columbia, or both, as the case may be,
        will provide the Tla'amin Nation with additional or replacement rights
        or other appropriate remedies.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        55. At the request of the Tla'amin Nation, the Parties will negotiate
        and attempt to reach agreement on the provision of those additional or
        replacement rights or other appropriate remedies under paragraph 54.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> CONSULTATION </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        56. Neither Canada nor British Columbia has any obligation to Consult

        57. Nothing in this Agreement, nor any action or authority taken,
        exercised or carried out by Canada or British Columbia in accordance

        infringement of a Tla'amin Section 35 Right.

        <strong> PERIODIC REVIEW </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        58. The Parties recognize and acknowledge that this Agreement provides a
        foundation for an ongoing relationship amongst the Parties and commit to
        conducting a periodic review of this Agreement in accordance with
        paragraphs 59 to 65.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        59. At least sixty days before each Periodic Review Date, each Party
        will provide the other Parties with written notice if the Party wishes
        to discuss a matter contemplated by paragraph 60, and if no notice is
        provided by any Party, the Parties will forego engaging in a review for
        that Review Period.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        60. The purpose of the periodic review is to provide an opportunity for
        the Parties to meet and discuss:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the practicability of the harmonization of the Tla'amin Nation's
        legal and administrative systems, including law-making authorities that
        are being exercised by the Tla'amin Nation, with those of Canada and
        British Columbia;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the practicability of processes established by the Parties under this

        may be agreed to by the Parties in writing.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        61. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the discussion under paragraph
        60 will take place on the Periodic Review Date and such other dates as
        the Parties agree, but will not exceed the applicable Review Period.
        Within 60 days of the end of that discussion each Party will provide the
        other Parties with its written response on any matter discussed during
        that Review Period.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        62. The periodic review under paragraphs 58 to 65 and all discussions
        and information relating to the periodic review are without prejudice to
        the legal positions of the Parties, unless the Parties otherwise agree.
        Nothing made or done in relation to a periodic review, including the
        discussions or the responses provided by the Parties, except for any
        amendments made pursuant to paragraph 64, creates any legally binding
        rights or obligations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        63. Except for the Parties' commitment to meet and provide written
        responses under paragraph 61, neither the periodic review process under
        paragraphs 58 to 65, nor the decisions or actions of the Parties
        relating in any way to the periodic review process, is:

      <p class="schIndent2">a. subject to the Dispute Resolution Chapter; or</p>

        review under paragraphs 58 to 65;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. where the Parties agree to amend this Agreement, any such amendment
        will be made in accordance with the Amendment Chapter; and

        <strong> INFORMATION AND PRIVACY </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        66. For the purposes of federal and provincial access to information and
        privacy legislation, information that the Tla'amin Nation provides to
        Canada or British Columbia in confidence is deemed to be information
        received or obtained in confidence from another government.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        67. Where the Tla'amin Nation requests disclosure of information from
        Canada or British Columbia, the request will be evaluated as if it were
        a request by a province for disclosure of that information, but Canada
        and British Columbia are not required to disclose to the Tla'amin Nation
        information that is only available to a particular province or
        particular provinces, or that is not available to any provinces.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        68. The Parties may enter into agreements in relation to any one or more
        of the collection, protection, retention, use, disclosure and

        with any applicable legislation, including federal and provincial access
        to information and privacy legislation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        69. Canada or British Columbia may provide information to the Tla'amin
        Nation in confidence if the Tla'amin Nation has made a law or has
        entered into an agreement with Canada or British Columbia, as the case
        may be, under which the confidentiality of the information will be
        protected.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        70. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

        <em> Canada Evidence Act </em>

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. where Federal or Provincial Law allows the disclosure of certain

        Canada and British Columbia are not required to disclose that

        <strong> OBLIGATION TO NEGOTIATE </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">

      <p class="schIndent1">
        72. Where this Agreement provides that the Parties, or any two of them,
        "will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement", those negotiations will
        be conducted as set out in the Dispute Resolution Chapter, but no Party
        is obliged to proceed to arbitration under Stage Three unless, in a
        particular case, they are required to do so under paragraph 27 of the
        Dispute Resolution Chapter.
      </p>

        the Minister may, from time to time, determine that a function carried

        e. that the reliance of the Tla'amin Nation on fiscal transfers should

        that fund;

        room or to transfer revenues or tax authorities to the Tla'amin Nation;

        6. Where the Parties do not reach agreement on a subsequent Fiscal
        Financing Agreement by the expiry date of an existing Fiscal Financing
        Agreement, the existing Fiscal Financing Agreement will:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. continue in effect for up to two years from its original expiry date,
        or for such other period of time as the Parties may agree to in writing;

        ii. the date of commencement of a subsequent Fiscal Financing Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        7. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in a Fiscal Financing

        Tla'amin Nation's law-making authority under this Agreement or the
        exercise of the Tla'amin Nation's law-making authority does not create
        or imply any financial obligation or service responsibility on the part
        of any Party.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        8. For greater certainty, when the Parties agree in the initial Fiscal
        Financing Agreement that Canada will provide one time federal funding to
        the Tla'amin Nation to establish a Fish Fund to support the provision of
        agreed upon implementation activities and Canada duly provides that
        funding, Canada has no further obligation to negotiate and attempt to
        reach agreement on the provision of additional federal funding for those
        implementation activities.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. Any funding required for the purposes of the Fiscal Financing
        Agreement, or any other agreement that is reached as a result of

        Agreement and that provides for financial obligations to be assumed by a
        Party, is subject to the appropriation of funds:

        CHAPTER 26 — DISPUTE RESOLUTION
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> GENERAL </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. In this Chapter, and in Appendices X-1 to X-6, a Party is deemed to
        be directly engaged in a Disagreement where another Party, acting
        reasonably, gives the first Party written notice requiring it to
        participate in a process described in this Chapter to resolve the
        Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">2. The Parties share the following objectives:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. to cooperate with each other to develop harmonious working
        relationships;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">b. to prevent or minimize Disagreements;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. to identify Disagreements quickly and resolve them in the most
        expeditious and cost-effective manner possible; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. to resolve Disagreements in a non-adversarial, collaborative and
        informal atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. Except as otherwise provided, participating Parties may agree in
        writing to vary a procedural requirement contained in this Chapter, or
        in Appendices X-1 to X-6, as it applies to a particular Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. Participating Parties may agree to or the Supreme Court of British
        Columbia on application may order:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. the abridgment of a time limit; or</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the extension of a time limit, despite the expiration of that time
        limit,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">in this Chapter or in Appendices X-1 to X-6.</p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> SCOPE: WHEN THIS CHAPTER APPLIES </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. This Chapter does not apply to all disputes between or among the
        Parties, but is limited to the disputes described in paragraph 6.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">6. This Chapter applies to:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. a dispute respecting:</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. the interpretation, application or implementation of this Agreement;
        or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. a breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. a dispute, where provided for in this Agreement; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. negotiations required to be conducted under any provision of this
        Agreement that provides that the Parties, or any two of them, "will
        negotiate and attempt to reach agreement".
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">7. This Chapter does not apply to:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. an agreement between or among the Parties that is ancillary,
        subsequent, or supplemental to this Agreement unless the Parties have
        agreed that this Chapter applies to that agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">b. the Implementation Plan; or</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">c. disputes, where excluded from this Chapter.</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        8. Nothing in this Chapter limits the application of a dispute
        resolution process, under any law, to a dispute involving a person if
        that dispute is not a Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. Nothing in Federal or Provincial Law limits the right of a Party to
        refer a Disagreement to a process under this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> DISAGREEMENTS TO GO THROUGH STAGES </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        10. The Parties desire and expect that most Disagreements will be
        resolved by informal discussions between or among the Parties, without
        the necessity of invoking this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        11. Subject to this Agreement, Disagreements not resolved informally
        will progress, until resolved, through the following stages:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. Stage One: formal, unassisted efforts to reach agreement between or
        among the Parties, in collaborative negotiations under Appendix X-1;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. Stage Two: structured efforts to reach agreement between or among the
        Parties with the assistance of a Neutral, who has no authority to
        resolve the dispute, in a facilitated process under Appendix X-2, X-3,
        X-4 or X-5, as applicable; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. Stage Three: final adjudication in arbitral proceedings under
        Appendix X-6 or in judicial proceedings.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        12. Except as otherwise provided, no Party may refer a Disagreement to
        final adjudication in Stage Three without first proceeding through Stage
        One and a facilitated process in Stage Two, as required in this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        13. Nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from commencing arbitral or
        judicial proceedings at any time:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. to prevent the loss of a right to commence proceedings due to the
        expiration of a limitation period; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. to obtain interlocutory or interim relief that is otherwise available
        pending resolution of the Disagreement under this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> STAGE ONE: COLLABORATIVE NEGOTIATIONS </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        14. Where a Disagreement is not resolved by informal discussion, and a
        Party directly engaged in the Disagreement wishes to invoke this
        Chapter, that Party will deliver written notice under Appendix X-1 to
        the other Parties, requiring the commencement of collaborative
        negotiations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        15. Upon receiving notice under paragraph 14, each Party directly
        engaged in the Disagreement will participate in the collaborative
        negotiations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        16. A Party not directly engaged in the Disagreement may participate in
        the collaborative negotiations by giving written notice to the other
        Parties, preferably before the collaborative negotiations commence.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        17. If the Parties have commenced negotiations described in subparagraph
        6.c, then, for all purposes under this Chapter, those negotiations will
        be deemed collaborative negotiations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        18. Collaborative negotiations terminate in the circumstances set out in
        Appendix X-1.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> STAGE TWO: FACILITATED PROCESSES </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        19. Within 15 days of termination of collaborative negotiations that
        have not resolved a Disagreement, a Party directly engaged in the
        Disagreement may require the commencement of a facilitated process by
        delivering notice to the other Parties.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">20. Notice under paragraph 19:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. will include the name of the Party or Parties directly engaged in the
        Disagreement and a summary of the particulars of the Disagreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. may propose the use of a particular facilitated process described in
        paragraph 23.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        21. Upon receiving notice under paragraph 19, a Party directly engaged
        in the Disagreement will participate in a facilitated process described
        in paragraph 23.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        22. A Party not directly engaged in the Disagreement may participate in
        the facilitated process by giving written notice to the other Parties
        within 15 days of delivery of notice under paragraph 19.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        23. Within 30 days after delivery of notice under paragraph 19, the
        Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement will attempt to agree to
        use one of the following processes:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. mediation under Appendix X-2;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">b. technical advisory panel under Appendix X-3;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">c. neutral evaluation under Appendix X-4;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. community advisory council under Appendix X-5; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. any other non-binding dispute resolution process assisted by a
        Neutral,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        and, if they fail to agree, they will be deemed to have selected
        mediation under Appendix X-2.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">24. A facilitated process terminates:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. in the circumstances set out in the applicable Appendix; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. as agreed in writing by the participating Parties, if an Appendix
        does not apply.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> NEGOTIATING CONDITIONS </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        25. In order to enhance the prospect of reaching agreement, the Parties
        participating in collaborative negotiations or a negotiation component
        of a facilitated process will:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. at the request of a participating Party, provide timely disclosure of
        sufficient information and documents to enable a full examination of the
        subject matter being negotiated;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. make every reasonable effort to appoint negotiating representatives
        with sufficient authority to reach an agreement, or with ready access to
        such authority; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">c. negotiate in good faith.</p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        26. Any agreement reached in a process under this Chapter:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. will be:</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">i. recorded in writing;</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. signed by authorized representatives of the Parties to the
        agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">iii. delivered to all Parties; and</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. is binding only on the Parties who have signed the agreement.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> STAGE THREE: ADJUDICATION — ARBITRATION </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        27. Where a Disagreement arises out of any provision of this Agreement
        that provides that a dispute will be "finally determined by
        arbitration", the Disagreement will, where a Party directly engaged in
        the Disagreement has delivered a notice of arbitration to all Parties as
        required under Appendix X-6, be referred to and finally resolved by
        arbitration in accordance with that Appendix.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        28. A Disagreement, other than a Disagreement referred to in paragraph
        27, with the written agreement of all Parties directly engaged in the
        Disagreement, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in
        accordance with Appendix X-6.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        29. Where two Parties make a written agreement under paragraph 28, they
        will deliver a copy of the agreement to the other Party that is not
        directly engaged in the Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        30. A Party not directly engaged in a Disagreement will be added as a
        party to the arbitration of that Disagreement, whether or not that Party
        has participated in collaborative negotiations or a required facilitated
        process, upon that Party delivering written notice to the participating
        Parties to the arbitration within 15 days after receiving notice under
        paragraph 27 or copy of a written agreement under paragraph 28.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        31. Notwithstanding paragraph 30, an arbitral tribunal may make an order
        adding a Party as a participating Party at any time if the arbitral
        tribunal considers that:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the participating Parties will not be unduly prejudiced; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the issues stated in the pleadings are materially different from
        those identified in the notice to arbitrate under paragraph 27 or the
        written agreement to arbitrate in paragraph 28,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        and, in that event, the arbitral tribunal may make any order it
        considers appropriate or necessary in the circumstances respecting
        conditions, including the payment of costs, upon which the Party may be
        added.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> EFFECT OF ARBITRAL AWARD </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        32. An arbitral award is final and binding on all Parties whether or not
        a Party has participated in the arbitration.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        33. Notwithstanding paragraph 32, an arbitral award is not binding on a
        Party that has not participated in the arbitration where:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. the Party did not receive copies of:</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. the notice of arbitration or agreement to arbitrate; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. the pleadings and any amendments or supplements to the pleadings; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the arbitral tribunal refused to add the Party as a participating
        Party to the arbitration under paragraph 31.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> APPLICATION OF LEGISLATION </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        34. No legislation of any Party respecting arbitration, except the
        Federal Settlement Legislation and Provincial Settlement Legislation,
        applies to an arbitration conducted under this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        35. A court will not intervene or offer assistance in an arbitration or
        review an arbitral award under this Chapter except as provided in
        Appendix X-6.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> STAGE THREE: ADJUDICATION — JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        36. Nothing in this Chapter creates a cause of action where none
        otherwise exists.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        37. Subject to paragraph 38, at any time a Party may commence
        proceedings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia with respect to a
        Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        38. Subject to paragraph 13, a Party may not commence judicial
        proceedings where the Disagreement:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. is referred to arbitration under paragraph 27 or 28;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. has not been referred to collaborative negotiations or a facilitated
        process as required under this Chapter; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. has been referred to collaborative negotiations or a facilitated
        process that has not yet been terminated.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        39. Nothing in subparagraph 38.a prevents an arbitral tribunal or the
        participating Parties from requesting the Supreme Court of British
        Columbia to make a ruling respecting a question of law as permitted in
        Appendix X-6.

        Works for the purpose of undertaking works to protect any Works located
        within the Lands or within an Excluded Right of Way Area or to protect
        persons or property that may be at risk from such Works, provided that:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent4">
        A. Hydro or TELUS will before commencing such works deliver to the
        Grantor for approval a written work plan describing the proposed work on

        of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not undertaking the
        work. If Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, and the Grantor cannot
        agree on a work plan requested by Hydro or TELUS within 30 days of
        receipt by the Grantor of the proposed work plan, then either party may
        refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under section&nbsp;18 of

        D. if Hydro or TELUS, as the case may be, determines in its reasonable
        judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are imminent safety
        concerns, Hydro and TELUS may, without approval of the Grantor,
        undertake works and take such steps on the Lands as are reasonably
        required to be taken immediately in order to protect the Works, or to
        protect persons or property that may be at risk from the Works, and in
        that event Hydro or TELUS will as soon as reasonably possible thereafter
        notify the Grantor; and

        Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes
        authorized and approved in the Licence, provided however that this
        Consent does not extend so far as to permit British Columbia to
        authorize the Float Home Area Users to alter or enlarge any Improvements
        existing on the Float Home Area on •, or to construct, erect, place,

        British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants,
        invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, to enter onto
        the Upland or to construct, place, erect or install any buildings,

        immediately adjacent to foreshore. If Upland is not in LTO then describe
        land as accurately as possible];
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        A. British Columbia is the owner in fee simple of the parcel or tract of
        land being the foreshore fronting on the Upland and all land covered by
        water adjoining the Upland (the "Foreshore");
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        B. The Upland and Foreshore are adjacent to each other and Tla'amin, as
        owner of the Upland, is entitled to exercise its riparian right of
        access to the Upland by crossing the Foreshore;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        C. British Columbia wishes to interfere with Tla'amin's riparian right
        of access to the Upland by authorizing, under an existing licence of
        occupation (the "Licence"), the use of the identified portions of the
        Foreshore for marine invertebrates aquaculture purposes on the portion
        of the Foreshore shown outlined in bold on the attached Schedule "A"
        ("Aquaculture Area") pursuant to a licence dated for reference • and
        numbered •, which has a term expiring •; and

        D. Tla'amin is prepared to consent to such interference pursuant to the
        provisions set out below.

        NOW THEREFORE THIS CONSENT WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of
        ONE ($1.00) dollar and other good and valuable consideration, now paid
        by British Columbia to Tla'amin (the receipt and sufficiency of which is
        hereby acknowledged), the parties agree as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. Tla'amin, as owner of the Upland, on the terms set forth herein,
        hereby consents to British Columbia, as owner of the Foreshore, and its
        servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees
        and all those claiming through them, interfering, in accordance with the
        Licence, with Tla'amin's right, as owner of the Upland, to pass and
        repass over the Aquaculture Area to gain access to and from the Upland.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. Tla'amin acknowledges and agrees that the Consent hereby given
        entitles British Columbia to authorize its servants, employees, agents,
        contractors, tenants, invitees, licensees, and all those claiming
        through them, in accordance with the Licence (collectively, the
        "Aquaculture Area Users") to:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a) construct, erect, place, install, moor, maintain, replace, renovate
        and repair buildings, structures, works, improvements and chattels
        (collectively, the "Improvements") on all or any part of the Aquaculture
        Area which are reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes
        authorized and approved in the Licence, provided however that this
        Consent does not extend so far as to permit British Columbia to
        authorize the Aquaculture Area Users to alter or enlarge any
        Improvements existing on the Aquaculture Area on •, or to construct,
        erect, place, install or moor new Improvements on the Aquaculture Area
        after •, if such alteration, enlargement, construction, erection,
        placement, installation or mooring would materially interfere with
        reasonable access to the Upland; and

      <p class="schIndent2">
        b) do all other acts within the Aquaculture Area, reasonably necessary
        or incidental to the purposes authorized and approved in connection with
        the Licence.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. Tla'amin or any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be,
        will give written notice of this Consent to any person to whom it
        proposes to dispose of any portion of the Upland which borders on the
        Foreshore, which notice will be received by that person prior to such
        disposition. Prior to or concurrently with such disposition, Tla'amin or
        any of its successors or assigns, as the case may be, will obtain a
        written ratification of this Consent by the transferee of such portion
        of the Upland in the same form as this Consent and will deliver an
        originally executed copy thereof to British Columbia. For the purposes
        of this paragraph, the word "dispose" means any transfer by any method
        to any person entitled to exercise a riparian right of access to the
        Upland.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. British Columbia covenants and agrees with Tla'amin that nothing in
        this Consent will be deemed or otherwise construed so as to permit
        British Columbia, its servants, employees, agents, contractors, tenants,
        invitees, licensees and all those claiming through them, to enter onto
        the Upland or to construct, place, erect or install any buildings,
        structures, improvements or works thereon.

        expenses, including legal and other professional services costs if any,
        caused by or arising out of the Grantee's breach, and in the event of a
        call on the Security of the Grantee will, as a condition of the
        continuation of this Agreement, immediately pay to the Owner the amount
        of the draw so that the full amount of the Security is available.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The parties agree that the amount of the Security does not constitute a
        liquidated damages estimate of the Owner's damages if the Grantee
        breaches its obligations hereunder and the Owner reserves its right to
        claim for further damages.

        21.
        <strong> Interpretation </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">In this Agreement:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) all attached schedules form an integral part of this Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (b) unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the
        plural and the masculine includes the feminine gender, body politic and
        a corporation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (c) the headings are for convenience only and are not to be construed as
        defining or in any way limiting the scope or intent of the Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (d) a reference to an enactment of British Columbia or of Canada will be
        deemed to include a reference to any subsequent amendments or
        replacements; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (e) if any provision is determined by a court or arbitrator of competent
        jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be
        considered separate and severable, and the legality or enforceability of
        the remaining provisions will not be affected by that determination.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        22. Each party will, upon the request of the other, do or cause to be
        done all lawful acts necessary for the performance of the provisions of
        this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        23. Wherever this Agreement provides that an action may be taken, a
        consent or approval must be obtained or a determination must be made,
        then the Owner or the Grantee, as the case may be, will act reasonably
        in taking such action, deciding whether to provide such consent or
        approval or making such determination; but where this Agreement states
        that the Owner or the Grantee have sole discretion to take an action,
        provide a consent or approval or make a determination, there will be no
        requirement to show reasonableness or to act reasonably in taking that
        action, providing that consent or approval or making that determination.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        24. If, due to a strike, lockout, labour dispute, act of God, inability
        to obtain labour or materials, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order
        of a competent governmental authority, enemy or hostile action, civil
        commotion, fire or other casualty or any condition or case beyond the
        Grantee's reasonable control, other than normal weather conditions, the
        Grantee is delayed in performing any of its obligations under this
        Agreement, the time for the performance of that obligation will be
        extended by a period of time equal to the period of time of the delay so
        long as:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        (a) the Grantee gives notice to the Owner within 30 days of the
        commencement of the delay setting forth the nature of the delay and an
        estimated time frame for the performance of its obligation; and
      </p>

        (b) the Grantee diligently attempts to remove the delay.

        condition, covenant or other provision herein shall not be construed as
        or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach of the same or any
        other term, condition, covenant, or other provision and the consent or
        approval of the Owner to any act by the Licensee requiring the consent
        or approval of the Owner shall not be considered to waive or render

        or may otherwise authorize other persons to enter on or use or occupy
        the Land, so long as the grant or authorization does not materially
        affect the exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder. The question of
        whether a grant materially affects the exercise of the Licensee's rights
        hereunder shall be determined by the Owner acting reasonably. If the
        Owner, by written instrument, grants a licence, right or interest to
        others to use or occupy the Land, such grant will contain a provision
        identical to subsection 4.1 (f) of this licence obligating the new

        means a section in this Appendix.

      <p align="left">
        <strong> GENERAL </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. Provincial Law applies to the expropriation of Tla'amin Lands by a
        Provincial Expropriating Authority except to the extent that this
        Agreement modifies its application.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. A Provincial Expropriating Authority may expropriate an estate or
        interest in Tla'amin Lands only with the consent and by the order of the
        Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may issue an order consenting to
        an expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands only:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. after the conclusion of the procedures described in Sections 4 and 5:
        and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. where the expropriation is justifiable in accordance with Section 6.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. Before the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council makes a decision under
        Section 3, the Provincial Expropriating Authority will provide to the
        Tla'amin Nation a report which states the reasons for the expropriation
        and addresses the factors under Sections 6. a and 6. d.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. Within 30 days of receipt of the report under Section 4, Tla'amin
        Nation will notify the Provincial Expropriating Authority if it objects
        to the expropriation of the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands and,
        within 30 days of the Provincial Expropriating Authority's receipt of
        notice from the Tla'amin Nation, the Provincial Expropriating Authority
        and the Tla'amin Nation will make reasonable efforts to resolve the
        objection raised by the Tla'amin Nation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        6. For the purposes of Section 3. b an expropriation is justifiable
        where the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council is satisfied that, in addition
        to the applicable requirements under Provincial Law, the following
        requirements have been met:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative to the
        expropriation, including the use of lands that are not Tla'amin Lands;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Provincial Expropriating
        Authority to acquire the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands through
        agreement with the Tla'amin Nation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the Provincial Expropriating Authority has confirmed that the
        proposed expropriation is the smallest estate or interest necessary and
        for the shortest time required;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that
        would be protected from disclosure under Provincial Law, has been
        provided to the Tla'amin Nation, including the report referred to in
        Section 5; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. where the Tla'amin Nation has objected to the expropriation,
        reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the objection.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        7. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council will not consent to the
        expropriation before the end of the period provided for in Section 5.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        8. Notwithstanding Sections 3 to 7, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council
        may consent to the expropriation if the Minister or
        Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council has declared a state of emergency.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> COMPENSATION </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. In the event an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands is expropriated
        by a Provincial Expropriating Authority, the Provincial Expropriating
        Authority will provide compensation in accordance with this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        10. The total value of compensation for an expropriated estate or
        interest in Tla'amin Lands will be based on the criteria set out in
        Provincial Law.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        11. Where the Provincial Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation
        disagree on the total value of compensation for an expropriated estate
        or interest held by the Tla'amin Nation, the dispute will be finally
        determined by arbitration. A dispute under this Section will not delay
        the expropriation. For the purposes of this Section British Columbia
        will act on behalf of the Provincial Expropriating Authority on such
        terms as British Columbia and the Provincial Expropriating Authority may
        agree.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> EXPROPRIATION OF LESS THAN A FEE SIMPLE ESTATE </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        12. Where less than the fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands
        is expropriated by a Provincial Expropriating Authority:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the parcel of land retains its status as Tla'amin Lands;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. Tla'amin Law applies to the parcel of land except to the extent that
        the Tla'amin Law is inconsistent with the use of land for which the
        expropriation took place; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the Tla'amin Nation may continue to use and occupy the parcel of
        land, except to the extent that such use or occupation interferes with
        the use of land for which the expropriation took place.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        13. Sections 14 to 20 do not apply to an expropriation by a Provincial
        Expropriating Authority of less than the fee simple estate in a parcel
        of Tla'amin Lands.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> EXPROPRIATION OF A FEE SIMPLE ESTATE </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        14. Where a fee simple estate in Tla'amin Lands is expropriated by a
        Provincial Expropriating Authority:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. unless British Columbia and the Tla'amin Nation agree otherwise, the
        expropriation will include the fee simple estate to Subsurface Resources
        which will revert to British Columbia at the time of the expropriation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. unless the Provincial Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation
        agree otherwise, the expropriation will include all other interests in
        the land; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. those lands will no longer be Tla'amin Lands and Appendix C will be
        amended in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the
        Amendment Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">15. For the purposes of Section 14:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the Provincial Expropriating Authority will be responsible for the
        transaction costs including the cost of surveying, registering and
        transferring the land; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. where the land is registered in the Land Title Office, British
        Columbia will file such certificates or other documents in the Land
        Title Office as may be required under the
        <em> Land Title Act </em>
        .
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> PROVINCIAL CROWN LAND AS REPLACEMENT LAND </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        16. Where British Columbia expropriates a fee simple estate in Tla'amin
        Lands that is held by the Tla'amin Nation, British Columbia will make
        reasonable efforts to identify and offer provincial Crown land of
        comparable value within the Tla'amin Area to the Tla'amin Nation as
        compensation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        17. Where there is no agreement between British Columbia and the
        Tla'amin Nation on the provision of land as compensation under Section
        16, British Columbia will provide the Tla'amin Nation with other
        compensation according to Provincial Law.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        18. Where the replacement land provided under Section 16 is of less than
        comparable value, British Columbia will provide additional compensation
        in accordance with Section 10.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        19. Where the Tla'amin Nation accepts provincial Crown land as
        replacement land, British Columbia will provide the Tla'amin Nation with
        a certificate transferring the indefeasible title or, where applicable,
        the registered title to the parcel of land to the Tla'amin Nation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        20. At the request of the Tla'amin Nation, British Columbia will consent
        to the replacement land being added to Tla'amin Lands and, where Canada
        consents to such replacement lands becoming Tla'amin Lands in accordance
        with a request under paragraph 85 of the Lands Chapter, upon receipt by
        the Tla'amin Nation of notice of the consent of each of British Columbia
        and Canada Appendix C will be amended in accordance with the process set
        out in paragraph 9 of the Amendment Chapter.

      <p align="left">
        <strong> RETURN OF AN EXPROPRIATED ESTATE OR INTEREST </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        21. Where an expropriated estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands is no
        longer required by the Provincial Expropriating Authority, the
        expropriated estate or interest will be returned to the Tla'amin Nation
        subject to terms to be negotiated at the time of the return of the
        expropriated estate or interest.
      </p>

        22. Where the fee simple estate to a parcel of land under Section 21 is
        transferred by the Provincial Expropriating Authority to the Tla'amin
        Nation, the Tla'amin Nation may add the parcel to Tla'amin Lands upon
        notice to Canada and British Columbia.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        23. Upon receipt by Canada and British Columbia of notice under Section

        Chapter.

        a. the amount of replacement land provided in fee simple under Section

        <strong> FEDERAL EXPROPRIATION PROCEDURES </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. The Governor-in-Council may consent to an expropriation of an estate
        or interest in Tla'amin Lands where the expropriation is justifiable in
        accordance with Section 3 and necessary for a public purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. For greater certainty, where a Federal Expropriating Authority seeks
        to expropriate an interest in Tla'amin Lands under section 4.1 of the
        <em> Expropriation Act </em>
        , that expropriation will be deemed to be necessary for a public
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. For the purposes of Section 1, an expropriation is justifiable where
        the Governor-in-Council is satisfied that the following requirements
        have been met:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative land to expropriate
        that is not Tla'amin Lands;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Federal Expropriating
        Authority to acquire the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands through
        agreement with the Tla'amin Nation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the smallest estate or interest necessary in Tla'amin Lands and for
        the shortest time required for the purpose for which the interest in
        land is sought is expropriated; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that
        would be protected from disclosure under Federal Law, has been provided
        to the Tla'amin Nation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. Prior to the Governor-in-Council issuing an order consenting to the
        expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands, the Federal
        Expropriating Authority will provide to the Tla'amin Nation and the
        Governor-in-Council, and make available to the public, a report stating
        the justification for the expropriation and describing the steps taken
        to satisfy the requirements of Section 3.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. Where the Tla'amin Nation objects to the expropriation of an estate
        or interest in Tla'amin Lands, it may, within 60 days after the report
        has been provided to the Tla'amin Nation in accordance with Section 4
        refer the dispute directly to neutral evaluation under Stage Two of the
        Dispute Resolution Chapter for a review of the steps taken to satisfy
        the requirement set out Section 3.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        6. The Federal Expropriating Authority will not seek Governor-in-Council
        consent to the expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. before the expiration of the period referred to in Section 5;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. where the Tla'amin Nation has referred the dispute to a neutral
        evaluator in accordance with Section 5, before:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. the neutral evaluator has delivered to Tla'amin Nation and the
        Federal Expropriating Authority an opinion on the dispute, such opinion
        to be rendered within 60 days of the referral being made; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. the Federal Expropriating Authority has delivered the opinion of the
        neutral evaluator to the Governor-in-Council for consideration under
        Sections 1 and 2; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. within such additional time as the Tla'amin Nation and the Federal
        Expropriating Authority may agree.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        7. Without limiting the generality of the Dispute Resolution Chapter,
        the opinion of the neutral evaluator under Section 6:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. is without prejudice to the legal positions that may be taken by a
        Federal Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation in court or in
        any other forum;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. will not be admissible in any legal proceedings, unless otherwise
        required by law; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. is not binding on the Governor-in-Council under Sections 1 and 3.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        8. At the time of the expropriation the Tla'amin Nation and the Federal
        Expropriating Authority will negotiate the terms and conditions of the
        return of an expropriated estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands,
        including requirements relating to financial considerations based on
        fair market value and the condition of the land to be returned.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. Where the terms and conditions of the return of an expropriated
        estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands cannot be agreed upon by the
        Tla'amin Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority at the time of
        the expropriation, the dispute will be finally determined by arbitration
        under the Dispute Resolution Chapter. For the purposes of this Section,
        Canada will act on behalf of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        10. Where a fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands is
        expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority, the Federal
        Expropriating Authority will make reasonable efforts to:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. identify replacement land of equivalent or greater size and
        comparable value within the Tla'amin Area, being either federal Crown
        land or lands available on a willing-seller willing-buyer basis; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. where acceptable to the Tla'amin Nation, to acquire and offer the
        replacement land to the Tla'amin Nation as partial or full compensation
        for the expropriation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        11. Subject to Section 15, if the replacement land identified by the
        Federal Expropriating Authority would result in the total size of
        Tla'amin Lands being less than at the Effective Date and the Tla'amin
        Nation does not agree that the replacement land is of comparable value
        to the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands being expropriated, the
        Tla'amin Nation may refer the dispute to be finally determined by
        arbitration under the Dispute Resolution Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        12. Where the Federal Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation
        are unable to agree on the provision of replacement land as
        compensation, the Federal Expropriating Authority will provide the
        Tla'amin Nation with other compensation in accordance with this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        13. The total value of compensation for an estate or interest in
        Tla'amin Lands expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority under
        this Appendix will be determined by taking into account the following
        factors:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the fair market value of the expropriated estate or interest;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the replacement value of any improvement to Tla'amin Lands in which
        an estate or interest has been expropriated;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. any expenses or losses resulting from the disturbance directly
        attributable to the expropriation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. any reduction in the value of any estate or interest in Tla'amin
        Lands that is not expropriated which directly relates to the
        expropriation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of Tla'amin
        Lands in which an estate or interest has been expropriated provided
        that:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. the cultural or other special value is only applied to an estate or
        interest in Tla'amin Lands recognized in law and held by the Tla'amin
        Nation; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. there will be no increase in the total value of compensation on
        account of any aboriginal rights, title or interest; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        f. the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or
        incidental to the occupation or use of Tla'amin Lands to the extent that
        the value is not otherwise compensated.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        14. Subject to Section 15, if the Federal Expropriating Authority and
        the Tla'amin Nation cannot agree on the total value of compensation or
        on whether the combination of replacement land and other compensation is
        equal to the total value of compensation, either Canada acting on behalf
        of the Federal Expropriating Authority or the Tla'amin Nation may refer
        the dispute for resolution under the Dispute Resolution Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">15. A dispute in respect of:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the valuation of replacement land under Section 11;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the total value of compensation under Section 13; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the terms and conditions of the return of land under Section 8,
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">will not delay the expropriation.</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        16. Any claim or incumbrance with respect to the estate or interest
        expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority may only be discharged
        against the amount of compensation payable under Section 13.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        17. Interest on compensation is payable from the date the expropriation
        takes effect at the interest rate payable under Federal Law.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        18. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates a fee simple
        estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands, the lands will no longer be
        Tla'amin Lands and Appendix C will be amended in accordance with the
        process set out in paragraph 9 of the Amendment Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        19. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates less than a fee
        simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the parcel of lands retains its status as Tla'amin Lands;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the parcel of lands remains subject to Tla'amin Law, except to the
        extent that such law interferes with the use of the parcel of lands for
        which the expropriation took place; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the Tla'amin Nation may continue to use and occupy the parcel of
        lands, except to the extent the use or occupation is inconsistent with
        the use of the parcel for which the expropriation took place, in the
        view of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        20. Where replacement land is transferred to the Tla'amin Nation as
        partial or full compensation in accordance with Section 10, the Tla'amin
        Nation may request that land be added to Tla'amin Lands.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        21. Canada and British Columbia will consent to the land referred to in
        Section 20 being added to Tla'amin Lands where:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. the land is within the Tla'amin Area;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the land does not overlap with an area over which another First
        Nation claims a legal interest or which is subject to treaty
        negotiations with another First Nation, except where the other First
        Nation in those cases consents to the addition;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the land is outside municipal boundaries unless the municipality
        consents; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. Canada or British Columbia will not be required to assume financial
        or other obligations, associated with the replacement land.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        22. Where Canada and British Columbia consent under Section 21, each of
        them will provide notice of its consent to the other Parties. Upon
        receipt by the Tla'amin Nation of the notices, Appendix C will be
        amended in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the
        Amendment Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        23. Where an expropriated estate or interest in a parcel of Tla'amin
        Lands is no longer required by the Federal Expropriating Authority for
        the purpose for which it was expropriated, the Federal Expropriating
        Authority will ensure that the estate or interest in land is returned to
        the Tla'amin Nation on the terms and conditions negotiated under Section
        8.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        24. The return of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands under Section
        23 will not result in Canada or British Columbia assuming financial or
        other obligations, unless agreed to in writing at the time of the
        expropriation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        25. Where the Tla'amin Nation becomes the registered owner of the fee
        simple estate to a parcel of land under Section 23, the Tla'amin Nation
        may add that parcel to Tla'amin Lands upon notice to Canada and British
        Columbia.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        26. Upon receipt by Canada and British Columbia of a notice under
        Section 25, the parcel will become Tla'amin Lands and Appendix C will be
        amended in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the
        Amendment Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        27. The federal department or agency or other entity that holds the
        expropriated estate or interest may decide, without the consent of the
        Governor-in-Council, that the expropriated estate or interest in land is
        no longer required and may determine the disposition of any improvements
        made to the land in a manner consistent with an agreement reached under
        Section 8 or the outcome of an arbitration under Section 9.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        28. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 9, 11 and 14, no dispute
        between Canada and the Tla'amin Nation respecting the interpretation,
        application or implementation of paragraphs 127 and 129 of the Lands
        Chapter or Sections 1 to 27 will be resolved under the Dispute
        Resolution Chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        29. Subject to Section 30, except to the extent that the provisions of
        the Lands Chapter and this Appendix modify the application of federal
        expropriation legislation in respect of an expropriation of Tla'amin
        Lands, all expropration legislation applies to an expropriation in
        respect of Tla'amin Lands under the Lands Chapter and this Appendix.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        30. Without limiting the generality of paragraph 10 of the General
        Provisions Chapter, this Agreement prevails to the extent of a Conflict
        with the federal
        <em> Expropriation Act </em>
        or other Federal Law relating to the expropriation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        31. Where the fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands is held by
        a Tla'amin Citizen, a Tla'amin Institution or a Tla'amin Corporation,
        any interest in that parcel may be expropriated by a Federal

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. A neutral evaluation commences on the date that the Parties directly

        <strong> APPOINTMENT OF NEUTRAL EVALUATOR </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. A neutral evaluation will be conducted by one individual jointly
        appointed by the Parties.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">3. A neutral evaluator will be:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">

        by the Neutral Appointing Authority on the written request of a Party
        that is copied to the other Parties.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. Subject to any limitations agreed to by the Parties, a neutral

      <p align="left">
        <strong> REQUIREMENT TO WITHDRAW </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        6. At any time a Party may give a neutral evaluator and the other
        Parties a written notice requiring the neutral evaluator to withdraw
        from the neutral evaluation on the grounds that the Party has
        justifiable doubts as to the neutral evaluator's independence or
        impartiality.

        <strong> COMMUNICATIONS </strong>

      <p align="left">
        <strong> CONDUCT OF NEUTRAL EVALUATION </strong>

      <p class="schIndent2">

        c. give prompt attention and respond to all communications from the
        neutral evaluator.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        14. A neutral evaluation will be conducted only on the basis of
        documents submitted by the Parties under Section 19 unless the Parties
        agree to, or the neutral evaluator requires, additional submissions or
        other forms of evidence.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        15. Where a hearing is held, the hearing will be conducted as
        efficiently as possible and in the manner the neutral evaluator
        specifies, after consultation with the Parties.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        16. Where a hearing is held, the Panel will give the Parties reasonable
        written notice of the hearing date, which notice will, in any event, be
        not less than seven days.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        17. No transcript or recording will be kept of a hearing, but this does
        not prevent an individual attending the hearing from keeping notes of
        the hearing.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        18. The legal rules of evidence do not apply to a neutral evaluation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        19. Within 15 days after the appointment of a neutral evaluator, each
        Party will deliver to the other Parties and to the neutral evaluator a
        written submission respecting the Disagreement, including facts upon
        which the Parties agree or disagree, and copies of any documents,
        affidavits and exhibits on which the Party relies.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        20. Within 21 days after the appointment of a neutral evaluator, a Party
        may submit a reply to the submission of any other Party and, in that
        event, will provide copies of the reply to the Party and the neutral
        evaluator.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        21. Where the matter referred to the neutral evaluator is an objection
        to a proposed expropriation of an interest in Tla'amin Lands under
        section 4 of Appendix J-2, the following abridgement of time limits
        applies to the neutral evaluation process set out in this Appendix,
        unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. under Section 4, the Parties must agree to a neutral evaluator within
        7 days after the commencement of a neutral evaluation; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. under Section 15, if a hearing is held it must be held within 35 days
        after the commencement of a neutral evaluation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        22. Where the matter referred to the neutral evaluator is an objection
        to a proposed expropriation of an interest in Tla'amin Lands under
        section 4 of Appendix J-2, sections 33, 34, 35. b and 36. a of this
        Appendix do not apply to the neutral evaluation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        23. For greater certainty, a neutral evaluation concerning an objection
        to a proposed expropriation of an interest in Tla'amin Lands under

        this Appendix on the day that notice in writing is received by the

        rejecting the challenge, may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to
        decide on the challenge.
      </p>

        34. While a request under Section 32 is pending, the Arbitral Tribunal,

        a. the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the Neutral

        a. where the arbitrator withdraws from office for any reason; or

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        41. An order or ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal made before the

        raised no later than the submission of the statement of defence, but a
        Party is not precluded from raising that plea by the fact that the Party
        has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        44. A plea that an Arbitral Tribunal is exceeding the scope of its

      <p class="schIndent1">
        46. An Arbitral Tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in Section 43 or

        47. Where an Arbitral Tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it

        76. Subject to Sections 74 and 75, the Arbitral Tribunal has the

        conducted on the basis of documents and other materials.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        77. The Arbitral Tribunal will give the Parties sufficient advance

        viewing any physical location.

        document on which the Arbitral Tribunal may rely in making its decision
        will be communicated to the Parties.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        79. Unless ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal, all hearings and meetings
        in arbitral proceedings, other than meetings of the Arbitral Tribunal,
        are open to the public.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        80. The Arbitral Tribunal will schedule hearings to be held on
        consecutive days until completion, unless the Parties agree otherwise.

        81. All oral evidence will be taken in the presence of the Arbitral
        Tribunal and all the Parties unless a Party is absent by default or has
        waived the right to be present.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        82. The Arbitral Tribunal may order any individual to be examined by the
        Arbitral Tribunal under oath or on affirmation in relation to the
        Disagreement and to produce before the Arbitral Tribunal all relevant
        documents within the individual's care, custody or control.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        83. The document assemblies delivered under Section 73 will be deemed to
        have been entered into evidence at the hearing without further proof and
        without being read out at the hearing, but a Party may challenge the
        admissibility of any document so introduced.

        84. Where the Arbitral Tribunal considers it just and reasonable to do
        so, the Arbitral Tribunal may permit a document that was not previously
        listed under Section 66, or produced as required under Section 69 or 73,
        to be introduced at the hearing, but the Arbitral Tribunal may take that
        failure into account when fixing the costs to be awarded in the
        arbitration.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        85. Where the Arbitral Tribunal permits the evidence of a witness to be
        presented as a written statement, any of the other Parties may require
        that witness to be made available for cross examination at the hearing.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        86. The Arbitral Tribunal may order a witness to appear and give

      <p class="schIndent1">
        88. Where, without showing sufficient cause, a Respondent fails to

        the Applicant's allegations.

        93. Where a Party so requests, or if the Arbitral Tribunal considers it

        cross examine the expert and to call any evidence in rebuttal.
