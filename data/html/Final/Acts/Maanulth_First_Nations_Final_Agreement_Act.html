            <p>
               WHEREAS the recognition and reconciliation of the prior presence of Aboriginal        peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of significant social and economic
        importance to all British Columbians;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is best achieved
        through negotiation and agreement, rather than through litigation;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS, in order to achieve this reconciliation, representatives of the
        Maa-nulth First Nations, Canada and British Columbia have negotiated the Maa-nulth First
        Nations Final Agreement in a process facilitated by the British Columbia Treaty
        Commission;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS British Columbia is building a New Relationship with First Nations and
        working to close the social and economic gaps that exist between Aboriginal and
        non-Aboriginal people;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS the Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement embodies the principles of
        this New Relationship, including mutual respect, recognition and reconciliation of
        Aboriginal rights and title;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS the Maa-nulth First Nations Final Agreement requires that British
        Columbia enact legislation to give effect to the Maa-nulth First Nations Final
        Agreement;
            </p>

            These notes do not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these notes is to
        enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the amounts to be shown in the final
        version of this Schedule. Interest at a rate of 4.545% per annum beginning on Effective Date
        and compounded annually was used to establish the provisional payment amounts in each
        Capital Transfer Payment Plan.

        amounts for the Effective Date and the first three anniversaries of the Effective Date in
        the Capital Transfer Payment Plan for that Maa‑nulth First Nation will be adjusted by
        deducting the amount paid (as adjusted for inflation in the equation below), as described in
        the following equation. This deduction will occur after the provisional payment plan has
        been adjusted for inflation as described in these notes in 2 and 3 above.

         <p align="left">
            The provisional loan repayment amounts are based on total outstanding

        each Maa‑nulth First Nation which were not included in the calculation of the provisional

        provisional negotiation loan and interest amounts were calculated; and
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            b) prorating and adjusting the additional amounts determined in accordance with
        paragraph 2a) for that Maa‑nulth First Nation over the applicable Negotiation Loan Repayment
        Plan such that the amounts in the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plans are proportional to
        the amounts in the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan and such that each final
        Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan incorporates interest on unpaid loan balances at 4.545% per
        annum beginning on the Effective Date and compounded annually which is the same rate of
        interest used to establish the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan.

            9.1 No provision of this Agreement will be considered to have been waived unless
        the waiver is in writing, and a waiver of a breach of a provision of this Agreement will not
        be construed as or constitute a waiver of any further or other breach of the same or any
        other provision of this Agreement, and a consent or approval to any act requiring consent or
        approval will not waive or render unnecessary the requirement to obtain consent or approval
        to any subsequent same or similar act.

            9.2 No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Owner under this Agreement is

        statute.

            9.3 This Agreement shall not entitle the Licensee to exclusive possession of the

        enter on or use or occupy the Land, or may otherwise authorize other persons to enter on or
        use or occupy the Land, so long as the grant or authorization does not materially affect the
        exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder. The question of whether a grant materially
        affects the exercise of the Licensee's rights hereunder shall be determined by the Owner
        acting reasonably. If the Owner, by written instrument, grants a licence, right or interest
        to others to use or occupy the Land, such grant will contain a provision identical to
        Subsection 3.1 (c) of this Agreement obligating the new grantee to keep the Land in a safe,
        clean and sanitary condition satisfactory to the Owner.

            11. The arbitrator will consider the material submitted by the Participating
        Parties, without convening an oral proceeding, and will decide the issue described in the
        notice of summary arbitration within seven days after either the submission of the last
        material or the expiration of the last date prescribed for the submission of material,
        whichever event occurs first.
