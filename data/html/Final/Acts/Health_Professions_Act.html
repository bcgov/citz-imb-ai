               On application by the discipline committee to the Supreme Court, a person who fails to attend or to produce records as required by an order under subsection (6) is liable to be committed for contempt as if he or she were in breach of an order or judgment of the Supreme Court.

               If the discipline committee considers the action necessary to protect the public between the time a hearing is commenced and the time it makes an order under section 39 (2), the discipline committee may impose limits or conditions on the practice of the designated health profession by the registrant or may suspend the registration of the registrant and, for those purposes, section 35 applies.
