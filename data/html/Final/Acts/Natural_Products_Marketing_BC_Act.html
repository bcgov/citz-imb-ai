               If, after an appeal is filed, an appeal panel considers that all or part of the
          subject matter of the appeal is more appropriately dealt with in a supervisory process
          under its supervisory power, the appeal panel, after giving the appellant and the
          marketing board or commission an opportunity to be heard, may defer further consideration
          of the appeal until after the supervisory process is completed.
