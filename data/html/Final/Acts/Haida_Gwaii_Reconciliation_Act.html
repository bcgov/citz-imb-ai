        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Kunst'aa guu – Kunst'aayah Reconciliation Protocol and
          the new relationship are intended by the Haida Nation and British

        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Kunst'aa guu – Kunst'aayah Reconciliation Protocol

        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Kunst'aa guu – Kunst'aayah Reconciliation Protocol
