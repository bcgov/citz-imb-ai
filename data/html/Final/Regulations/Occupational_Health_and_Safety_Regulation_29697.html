              The lux is the metric unit of light measurement, and replaces the
              footcandle (fc), which was the traditional imperial unit of
              measurement. One lux equals about one tenth of a footcandle. For
              example, the minimum illumination in footcandles for task category
              number 4, which is common in the office environment, is about 50
              footcandles.

          If traffic causes airborne dust to the extent visibility is reduced
          and interferes with effective traffic control or creates a hazard to
          workers, the employer must control the dust by the periodic
          application of water or other acceptable material to the grade surface
          to suppress dust.
