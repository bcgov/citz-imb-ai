            , to a bodily substance of the source individual named in this notice.

            provides that an exposed individual who intends to apply for a testing order from the court must first provide notice of that intention to the source individual. The notice provides the source individual the opportunity to be tested voluntarily for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, and to provide the results voluntarily to the exposed individual's physician, without the need to go to court. The exposed individual may not apply to the court for a testing order until at least 3 days have expired since the date the exposed individual provided notice to the source individual.

            Please note that if the matter goes to court, the court may grant a testing order if it is satisfied that the criteria in the Act are met. A source individual who does not comply with a testing order from the court may be subject to a fine of up to $10 000 for each day that the non-compliance continues.
