          Where an employee/appointee has sick bank credits, basic pay will
          continue during the first part of the long term disability benefit
          period until the sick bank is exhausted. The employee/appointee will
          be considered to be on a seven hour day and a five/two shift pattern
          for purposes of calculating the sick bank usage. The
          employee/appointee is on Long Term Disability Benefits while utilizing
          the sick bank credits and is therefore governed by the Long Term
          Disability Plan provisions.

          Long Term Disability claims will be adjudicated and paid by a
          claims-paying agent to be appointed by the employer. In the event a
          covered employee disputes the decision of the claims-paying agent
          regarding a claim for benefits under this plan, the employee may
          arrange to have the claim reviewed by a Claims Review Committee
          composed of three (3) medical doctors; one (1) designated by the
          claimant, one (1) by the employer, and a third agreed to by the first
          two. Written notice of a disputed claim or an appeal under this plan
          shall be sent to the Plan Administrator.
