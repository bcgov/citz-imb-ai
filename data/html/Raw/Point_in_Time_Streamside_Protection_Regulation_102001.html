						With reference to vegetation conditions in subsection (1), streamside protection and enhancement areas must be:</p><p class="para">(a) if subsection (1) (a) or (b) applies, at least 30 metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the bank for all fish bearing streams or for non fish bearing streams that are permanent;</p><p class="para">(b) if subsection (1) (a), (b) or (c) applies, at least 15 metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of bank for non fish bearing streams that are non-permanent;</p><p class="para">(c) if subsection (1) (c) applies, at least 15 metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of bank for non fish bearing streams that are permanent;</p><p class="para">(d) if subsection (1) (c) or (d) applies, the greater of the widths determined under subsection (1) (c) or (d) or at least 15 metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the bank for all fish bearing streams;</p><p class="para">(e) if subsection (1) (d) applies, at least 5 and up to 15 metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the bank for all non fish bearing streams.</p><p class="sub">(3) 
						If a stream is in a ravine that is less than 60 metres wide in total width from top of the ravine bank to top of ravine bank, not including the stream channel within its active floodplain boundaries, protection is to be consistent with subsection (2) (a) through (e), where appropriate, from the top of the ravine bank.</p><p class="sub">(4) 
						If a stream is in a ravine that is more than 60 metres in total width from top of ravine bank to top of ravine bank, not including the stream channel within its active floodplain boundaries, a protection and enhancement area must be at least 10 metres wide measured perpendicularly away from the top of the ravine bank.</p><p class="sub">(5) 
						In determining a streamside protection and enhancement area a local government may make allowances for one or more of the following if supported by an agreement under section 3:</p><p class="para">(a) the potential to provide greater opportunity for streamside protection and enhancement than what would be achieved under subsections (2) to (4);</p><p class="para">(b) the existence of obstacles that impair the ability to designate streamside protection and enhancement areas in accordance with subsections (2) to (4) including, but not limited to the following:</p><p class="subpara">(i)  biophysical conditions;</p><p class="subpara">(ii)  existing parcel sizes;</p><p class="subpara">(iii)  existing roads, works or services;</p><p class="subpara">(iv)  proposed roads, works and services needed to provide access or services to otherwise developable land;</p><p class="subpara">(v)  the existence of artificial controls on the high water mark or water level of a stream.</p></div><div class="section"><h4><a name="section7"> </a>Use of local government powers for protection and enhancement of areas</h4><p class="sec1"><span class="secno"><strong>7</strong></span>  When exercising its powers with respect to residential, commercial and industrial development, a local government must protect streamside protection and enhancement areas.</p></div><p xmlns:in="http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/2013/inline" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:oasis="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/oasis-exchange/table" xmlns:act="http://www.gov.bc.ca/2013/legislation/act" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" class="provisionsnote">[Provisions of the <em>Fish Protection Act</em>, S.B.C. 1997, c. 21, relevant to the enactment of this regulation: sections 12 and 13]</p></div></div><p class="copyright">Copyright © King's Printer, Victoria, British Columbia,
