class="schIndent1"><em>(1) This Form describes the disclosure that is required in an annual information form of a mutual fund. Each Item of this Form outlines disclosure requirements. Instructions to help you provide this disclosure are printed in italic type.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(2) Terms defined in National Instrument 81-101 Mutual Fund Prospectus Disclosure, National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds or National Instrument 81-105 Mutual Fund Sales Practices and used in this Form have the meanings that they have in those national instruments. However, subsection 1.3 (3) of National Instrument 81-102 does not apply to this Form.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(3) An annual information form is intended to supplement the information contained in the related simplified prospectus. Information contained in the related simplified prospectus need not be repeated except as required to make the annual information form comprehensible as an independent document. Generally speaking, all of the disclosure required to be provided in connection with a particular requirement of Form 81-101F1 ("the SP Form") in order to satisfy statutory disclosure requirements should be contained in the simplified prospectus. For some Items, it may be appropriate to expand in the annual information form on matters discussed in the simplified prospectus; for instance, a mutual fund organization may wish to describe in an annual information form some of its optional services in more detail than in the simplified prospectus. Generally speaking, however, an annual information form is intended to provide disclosure about different matters than those discussed in the simplified prospectus, which may be of assistance or interest to some investors.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(4) Unless otherwise required by this Form, information may be presented in a different format and style in an annual information form than in a simplified prospectus. An annual information form is required by National Instrument 81-101 to be presented in a format that assists in readability and comprehension. This Form generally does not mandate the use of a specific format achieve this goal and mutual funds are encouraged to use, as appropriate, tables, captions, bullet points or other organizational techniques that assist in presenting the disclosure clearly.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(5) An annual information form may contain photographs and artwork only if they are relevant to the business of the mutual fund, mutual fund family or members of the organization of the mutual fund and are not misleading.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(6) As with a simplified prospectus, an annual information form is to be prepared using plain language. Reference should be made to Part 3 of Companion Policy 81-101CP for a discussion concerning plain language and presentation.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(7) Any footnotes provided for under any Item of this Form may be deleted if the substance of the footnotes is otherwise provided.</em></p><p align="left"><em>Contents of an Annual Information Form</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(8) An annual information form pertains to one mutual fund but, unlike a simplified prospectus, is not required to be divided into a discrete Part A section, pertaining to general disclosure, and a Part B section, pertaining to fund-specific disclosure.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(9) It is not necessary to disclose the Items required by this Form in an annual information form in any particular order or under any particular heading. This is unlike the rule for a simplified prospectus, which provides that information contained in a simplified prospectus must be in the order and under the headings required by the SP Form.</em></p><p align="left"><em>Consolidation of Annual Information Forms into a Multiple AIF</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(10) Section 5.4 of National Instrument 81-101 requires an annual information form to be consolidated with one or more other annual information forms into a multiple AIF if the related simplified prospectuses are consolidated into a multiple SP. As the Instrument does not prevent the consolidation of annual information forms even if the related simplified prospectuses are not consolidated, a mutual fund organization may prepare one multiple AIF that pertains to all of its mutual funds, even if the simplified prospectuses for those mutual funds are not fully or even partially consolidated.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(11) Unlike the situation with a multiple SP, National Instrument 81-101 does not permit parts of a multiple AIF to be bound separately.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(12) Unlike the requirements for a multiple SP, there are no requirements that disclosure concerning each mutual fund described in a multiple AIF be organized in any particular manner or order. In particular, it is not necessary to use the catalogue approach required to be used in a multiple SP in which disclosure about individual mutual funds is required to be separately presented. Information may be presented separately for each mutual fund, or consolidated, at the option of the mutual fund organization.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(13) The requirements in this Form generally speak of "a mutual fund". These requirements apply to each mutual fund to which a multiple AIF pertains.</em></p><p align="left"><em>Multi-Class Mutual Funds</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(14) A mutual fund that has more than one class or series that are referable to the same portfolio may treat each class or series as a separate mutual fund for purposes of this Form, or may combine disclosure of one or more of the classes or series in one annual information form. If disclosure pertaining to more than one class or series is combined in one annual information form, separate disclosure in response to each Item in this Form must be provided for each class or series unless the responses would be identical for each class or series.</em></p><p class="schIndent1"><em>(15) As provided in National Instrument 81-102, a section, party, class or series of a class of securities of a mutual fund that is referable to a separate portfolio of assets is considered to be a separate mutual fund.
