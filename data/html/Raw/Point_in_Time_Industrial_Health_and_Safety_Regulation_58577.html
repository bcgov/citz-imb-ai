						Occupants of elevating work platforms must wear full body harnesses, secured to a fall arrest anchor, in accordance with the relevant regulations contained in section 8. This requirement does not apply to workers on self-propelled scissor lift type elevating platforms with all manufacturer's guardrails and chains in place, while operating on level, smooth terrain.</p><p class="sub">(9) 
						(a) Workers shall not be transported on aerial work platforms. Workers may remain on platforms while minor adjusting movements are made.</p><p class="para">(b) Elevating work platforms designed to be moved with the platform elevated may be exempted from the requirements of clause (9) (a) subject to limitations as specified in the applicable WCB standards.</p><p class="sub">(10) 
						Scissor type and other lifting mechanisms which create a shearing hazard shall be guarded where there is a possibility of workers inadvertently coming into contact with any hazardous moving parts of the platform lifting mechanism.</p><p class="sub">(11) 
						(a) All vehicle mounted aerial devices and self-propelled boom-supported elevating work platforms shall be subject to non-destructive testing of critical components, conducted by an agency or persons acceptable to the Board, at intervals not to exceed 24 months. Where defects are found in the critical components, the aerial device shall be repaired and then certified by a registered professional engineer. A permanent record of such tests and repairs shall be maintained for each unit.</p><p class="para">(b) For the purposes of this regulation <strong>"critical component"</strong> means any component the failure of which could result in immediate uncontrolled motion of the platform.</p><p class="para">(c) Notwithstanding sub-clauses (11) (a) and (b) an alternative preventive maintenance program to ensure the structural integrity of any such equipment may be submitted to the Board for consideration.</p><p class="sub">(12) 
						Every elevating work platform shall be fitted with an emergency stop button on the platform which will effectively de-energize all systems in the case of a malfunction of the control circuits.</p><p class="sub">(13) 
						Every elevating work platform shall be fitted with a clearly marked over-riding lowering control which, in an emergency, will enable a worker at ground level to lower the platform.</p><p class="sub">(14) 
						Elevating work platforms shall be fitted with "deadman" type controls. Such controls shall be protected against inadvertent operation through physical contact, electrical malfunction or other causes.</p><p class="sub">(15) 
						Every elevating work platform, except truck mounted units covered by CSA C225, shall be fitted with a warning system consisting of an intermittent horn or flashing light which will be activated automatically during any forward, reverse, up or down motion of the work platform.</p><p class="sub">(16) 
						(a) Every self-propelled boom-supported elevating work platform shall be fitted with a tilt alarm or other suitable warning device activated automatically when the platform is elevated and the carrier is more than 5 degrees out of level.</p><p class="para">(b) All other self propelled elevating work platforms, except truck mounted units covered by CSA C225, shall be provided with a tilt angle indicator readily visible to the operator.</p><p class="para">(c) (i) Scaffolds mounted on vehicles shall be secured to the vehicle in a manner that will ensure the stability of the scaffold.</p><p class="subpara">(ii)  Scaffolds shall be mounted only on vehicles which are equipped with levelling jacks or other devices designed to maintain the chassis in a level and stable condition.</p><p class="sub">(17) 
						Modifications, additions, or repairs to elevating work platforms shall only be effected in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer or of a registered professional engineer.</p><p class="hnote">[am.
