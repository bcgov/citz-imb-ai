To do this, click on "Amend insider profile" in the bar on the left side and make the necessary corrections.</p><p align="left"><strong>4  Review new issuer event reports</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">If the reporting issuer has filed an issuer event report that has not previously been viewed or that has been previously flagged for further viewing, you must review the issuer event report.</p><p class="schIndent1"><strong>To do this you must do the following: i) After you have selected an issuer and before selecting the "File insider report" feature, on the screen entitled "File insider report (Form 55-102F2) — Select issuer", click on the feature entitled "View issuer event reports" and the "Listing of issuer event reports" screen appears. ii) Next, click on the radio button for the report you wish to see and then select "View Report" and the "View issuer report information" screen appears with the text of the issuer event report. </strong></p><p class="schIndent1">If the insider's holdings of securities of the reporting issuer have been affected by an issuer event, the change in holdings must be reported. </p><p align="left"><strong>5  Security designation</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">For each position or transaction being reported, provide the security designation for the applicable security or class of securities. For this purpose, select the applicable security designation from the list shown for the reporting issuer's outstanding securities.</p><p class="schIndent1">If the applicable security designation does not appear in the list, check the "archived security designation" list containing designations of securities of the reporting issuer that are no longer outstanding and that may no longer be issued. Alternatively, check the "Insider defined security" list that will contain one or more security designations for the reporting issuer if any have been defined previously by or for the insider. In either case, if the applicable securities designation appears in the list, select it.</p><p class="schIndent1">If the applicable security designation does not appear in any of the lists described above, the insider must define the applicable security designation. For this purpose, select the appropriate "Security category" by choosing "Debt", "Equity", "Issuer Derivative" or "Third Party Derivative" from the list provided. For purposes of the insider reporting requirement, "issuer derivative" means a derivative issued by the reporting issuer to which the insider reporting requirement relates and "third party derivative" means a derivative issued by a person or company other than the reporting issuer to which the insider reporting requirement relates. The security category selected will determine the nature of the information that is required to be reported in relation to positions or transactions involving the applicable security designation.</p><p class="schIndent1">Next, create the "insider defined" security designation by selecting the most appropriate "Security name" from the list provided and, if applicable, use the "Additional description" field to enter any additional words used to describe the specific security or class of securities. For example, to provide the security designation of "Class A Preferred Shares, Series 1", select "Preferred Shares" from the "Security name" list and then type "Class A, Series 1" in the "Additional description" field.</p><p class="schIndent1"><em>Important Note:</em> If the security or class of securities being designated is a security that has been issued by the reporting issuer, it is important to try to avoid creating an "insider defined" security designation. If a security designation has not been created by the reporting issuer in respect of a security or class of securities issued by the reporting issuer, contact the reporting issuer to request that the security designation be added to the list of security designations for the reporting issuer's outstanding securities in its issuer profile supplement. However, you must create an "insider defined" security designation if this becomes necessary to ensure that the insider report is filed on a timely basis.</p><p class="schIndent1"><em>Derivatives:</em> If the security or class of securities being designated is an issuer derivative or a third party derivative, provide the security designation for the derivative and the security designation for the underlying security. See item 18 below. In addition, if the security or class of securities being designated is a third party derivative, the insider will have to provide the applicable security designation in all cases.</p><p align="left"><strong>6  Ownership type</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">Indicate whether the securities in respect of which a position or transaction is being reported are (1) beneficially owned directly, (2) beneficially owned indirectly or (3) controlled or directed.

Otherwise, enter the full legal name of the registered holder in the field provided.</p><p align="left"><strong>8  Opening balance of securities held (initial SEDI report only)</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">If the insider is filing an initial report in respect of securities held on becoming an insider or is reporting a change in a security or class of securities previously reported only in paper format, for each security or class of securities held directly or by a particular registered holder, disclose the initial number or amount of securities so held in the field provided for this purpose on the web page titled "File insider report — Opening balance on initial SEDI report (Non-Derivatives)", or the corresponding web page for derivatives, as applicable. For debt securities, provide the aggregate nominal value of the securities held.</p><p class="schIndent1">If an opening balance of securities held is required to be disclosed, the information with respect to the "date of transaction" and "nature of transaction" required under items 9 and 10 below will be generated by the SEDI software application. The "Opening/initial balance date" will be the date the insider became an insider or the date the insider entered for all opening balances for securities of this issuer.</p><p class="schIndent1">If the insider has previously filed a report in SEDI disclosing the balance of the security or class of securities held directly or by a particular registered holder, the opening balance of the security or class of securities so held is generated by the SEDI software application based on all previous reports filed in respect of the particular holding.</p><p class="schIndent1">If an initial SEDI report involves the holding of a derivative, see item 19 below.</p><p align="left"><strong>9  Date of transaction</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">Provide the date of each transaction being reported using the fields provided for this purpose.

Do not reduce the price being reported to reflect the amount of any commission paid. If the insider acquired or disposed of a security upon the exercise of an option, warrant, right or other derivative, report the exercise price per security. If the insider acquired or disposed of an option, warrant, right or other derivative, see item 23 below.</p><p class="schIndent1">If the transaction involved consideration other than cash, provide the approximate fair value of the consideration in Canadian dollars and describe the consideration in the "General remarks" field. If no consideration was paid or received by the insider, check "Not applicable".</p><p align="left"><strong>14  Currency</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">If the price paid or received in any transaction was in a currency other than Canadian dollars, provide the amount in that other currency and select the other currency from the list provided for this purpose.</p><p align="left"><strong>15  Closing balance of securities held</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">After each new transaction being reported in respect of a security or class of securities held directly or through a particular registered holder has been entered, a new balance of the security or class of securities held directly or by the particular registered holder will be generated automatically by SEDI prior to filing. If the insider believes that the closing balance reported by SEDI is not correct, the closing balance calculated by the insider must be reported in the field provided for this purpose. The insider shall make all reasonable efforts to reconcile the balance calculated by SEDI with the balance believed by the insider to be correct. An incorrect balance may have resulted from an error in a previous insider report or from a failure to report a previous transaction.</p><p align="left"><strong>16  General remarks</strong></p><p class="schIndent1">Provide additional information if necessary to provide an accurate description of each position and/or transaction in securities being reported.

Next, select the appropriate security category for the underlying security from the list provided and then provide the security designation for the underlying security in a similar manner to that described under item 5 above. If the security or class of securities being designated is a third party derivative, the insider will have to define the applicable security designation in all cases.
