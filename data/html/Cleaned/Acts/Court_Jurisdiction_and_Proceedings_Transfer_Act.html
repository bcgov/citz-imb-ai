          In a proceeding transferred to the Supreme Court from a court outside
          British Columbia, and despite any enactment imposing a limitation
          period, the Supreme Court must not hold a claim barred because of a
          limitation period if

          After a transfer of a proceeding to the Supreme Court takes effect,
          the Supreme Court must treat a procedure commenced on a certain date
          in a proceeding in the transferring court as if the procedure had been
          commenced in the Supreme Court on the same date.
