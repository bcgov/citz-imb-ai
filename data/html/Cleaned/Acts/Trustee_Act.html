          The court, on making an order appointing a new trustee, may, by that
          order or a subsequent order, vest the right to call for a transfer of
          a stock subject to the trust, or to receive the dividends or income of
          it, or to sue for or recover a chose in action subject to the trust,
          or any interest in respect of it, in the person or persons who on the
          appointment are trustees.
