               The remaining provisions of this Act must not be deemed or held to be inoperative or beyond the powers of the Legislature, but are valid and operative, and have the same effect as if they had been originally enacted as separate and independent enactments and as the only provisions of this Act.

               All the provisions of this Act that are within the powers of the Legislature remain in full force and effect, even if some provisions are held to be beyond the powers of the Legislature, the intention of the Legislature being to give separate and independent effect to the extent of its powers to every enactment and provision contained in this Act.
