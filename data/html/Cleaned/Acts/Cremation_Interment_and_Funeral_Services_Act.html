          If a director considers that a place of interment is abandoned or is
          in financial difficulty, the director, by written notice to the
          operator and the savings institution holding and administering the
          care fund that relates to the place of interment, may order the
          savings institution to administer the care fund, in accordance with

          On the date that a savings institution receives a written notice under
          subsection (1), the director becomes the sole operator with respect to
          the care fund for the place of interment referred to in the order and
          from that date the director has all the powers, functions and duties
