               If a licence to do an act which without that licence would create a forfeiture, or give a right to re-enter, under a condition or power reserved in a lease has at any time after March 25, 1881, been given or is given to any lessee or the lessee's assigns, the licence, unless otherwise expressed, extends only to the permission actually given, or to a specific breach of a proviso or covenant made or to be made, or to the actual assignment, underlease or other matter specially authorized to be done, but not so as to prevent a proceeding for a subsequent breach, unless otherwise specified in the licence.
