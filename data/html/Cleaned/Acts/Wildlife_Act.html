          If the Lieutenant Governor in Council considers that a species of
          wildlife is likely to become endangered in British Columbia if the
          factors affecting its vulnerability are not reversed, the Lieutenant
          Governor in Council may, by regulation, designate the species as a
          threatened species.

          wildlife may rot, spoil or otherwise perish, the conservation officer
          may dispose of the wildlife, or have the wildlife disposed of, as the
