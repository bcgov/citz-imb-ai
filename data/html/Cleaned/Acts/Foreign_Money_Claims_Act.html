          If, before making an order for the payment of money arising out of a
          claim or loss, the court considers that the person in whose favour the
          order will be made will be most truly and exactly compensated if all
          or part of the money payable under the order is measured in a currency
          other than the currency of Canada, the court must order that the money
          payable under the order will be that amount of Canadian currency that
          is necessary to purchase the equivalent amount of the other currency
          at a chartered bank located in British Columbia at the close of
          business on the conversion date.

          Canadian dollar equivalent to the other currency.
