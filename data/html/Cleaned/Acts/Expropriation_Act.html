               If part of the land is expropriated, the amount of compensation payable in respect of the matters referred to in subsection (1) (a) and (b) (i) may be established by determining the market value of the area of all of the land before the date of expropriation and subtracting from it the market value of the land remaining after the expropriation occurs, but in no case, subject to section 44, must compensation be less than the amount determined by multiplying the ratio of the area of the land taken to the area of all of the land before it was taken, times the value of the land before it was taken with the appropriate reduction if the interest expropriated is an easement, right of way or similar interest less than the fee simple interest.
