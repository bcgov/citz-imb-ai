          An appointment is not invalid on the ground that only an

          This Act does not prejudice or affect any provision in a deed, will or
          other instrument creating a power of appointment that declares the

          This Act does not give validity, force or effect to an appointment
          that the appointment would not have had if a substantial share of the

          unappointed to devolve on an object of that power.
