               WHEREAS the recognition and reconciliation of the prior presence of Aboriginal peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of significant social and economic importance to all British Columbians;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is best achieved through negotiation and agreement, rather than through litigation;

            <p>
               AND WHEREAS, in order to achieve this reconciliation, representatives of the Yale First Nation, Canada and British Columbia have negotiated the Yale First Nation Final Agreement in a process facilitated by the British Columbia Treaty Commission;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS British Columbia is building a New Relationship with First Nations and working to close the social and economic gaps that exist between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS the Yale First Nation Final Agreement embodies the principles of this New Relationship, including mutual respect, recognition and reconciliation of Aboriginal rights and title;
            </p>
            <p>
               AND WHEREAS the Yale First Nation Final Agreement requires that British Columbia enact legislation to give effect to the Yale First Nation Final Agreement;

            <p>
               THEREFORE HER MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia, enacts as follows:
