        <p>
          WHEREAS the recognition and reconciliation of the prior presence of
          Aboriginal peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of
          significant social and economic importance to all British Columbians;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is
          best achieved through negotiation and agreement, rather than through
          litigation;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS, in order to achieve this reconciliation, representatives
          of the Tsawwassen First Nation, Canada and British Columbia have
          negotiated the Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement in a process
          facilitated by the British Columbia Treaty Commission;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS British Columbia is building a New Relationship with First
          Nations and working to close the social and economic gaps that exist
          between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement embodies the
          principles of this New Relationship, including mutual respect,
          recognition and reconciliation of Aboriginal rights and title;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement requires that
          British Columbia enact legislation to give effect to the Tsawwassen
          First Nation Final Agreement;
        </p>
        <p>

        65. Before the Governor in Council consents to the expropriation of an

        report stating the justification for the expropriation and describing
        the steps taken to satisfy the requirements set out in clause 64.

        69. Where a fee simple interest in a parcel of Tsawwassen Lands is

        Expropriating Authority will make reasonable efforts:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. to identify replacement land within Tsawwassen Territory, being

        partial or full compensation for the expropriation.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        If the Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen First Nation are
        unable to agree on the provision of replacement land as compensation,

        with other compensation in accordance with this Agreement.

        Tsawwassen Lands being less than as at the Effective Date and Tsawwassen
        First Nation does not agree that the replacement land is of comparable
        value to the interest in Tsawwassen Lands being expropriated, then
        Tsawwassen First Nation may refer the issue of whether the replacement
        land is of comparable value to the interest in Tsawwassen Lands being
        expropriated to be finally determined by arbitration under the Dispute
        Resolution chapter.

        71. The total value of compensation for an interest in Tsawwassen Lands
        expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority under this chapter
        will be determined by taking into account the following factors:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the market value of the expropriated interest or of the Tsawwassen
        Lands in which an interest has been expropriated;

        b. the replacement value of any improvement to Tsawwassen Lands in which
        an interest has been expropriated;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. any expenses or losses resulting from a disturbance directly
        attributable to the expropriation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. any reduction in the value of any interest in Tsawwassen Lands that
        is not expropriated which directly relates to the expropriation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of
        Tsawwassen Lands in which an interest has been expropriated to
        Tsawwassen First Nation, provided that the cultural or other special
        value is only applied to an interest in Tsawwassen Lands recognized in
        law and held by Tsawwassen First Nation, and provided that there will be
        no increase in the total value of compensation on account of any Section
        35 Rights of Tsawwassen First Nation; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        f. the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or
        incidental to the occupation or use of Tsawwassen Lands by Tsawwassen
        First Nation to the extent that the value is not otherwise compensated.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        72. Subject to clause 73, if the total value of compensation cannot be
        agreed upon between the Federal Expropriating Authority and Tsawwassen
        First Nation, or where there is disagreement on whether the combination
        of replacement land and cash is equal to the total value of
        compensation, either the Federal Expropriating Authority or Tsawwassen
        First Nation may refer the issue of the total value of compensation for
        dispute resolution under the Dispute Resolution chapter.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        73. A dispute on the valuation of replacement land under clause 70, or

        1. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the creation, ownership and Disposition of a Tsawwassen Fee Simple
        Interest;

        2. Despite subclause 1.g, Tsawwassen First Nation may not expropriate:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. estates or interests granted or continued on the Effective Date where
        expropriation is precluded under the terms and conditions of those

        provincial ministry or agent of the provincial Crown or for the use of a
        Public Utility, whether or not an agent of the Crown, that would
        otherwise have authority to expropriate an estate or interest in land
        under provincial legislation or on whose behalf British Columbia may
        expropriate.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. For greater certainty, subclause 2.c describes an exception to the
        Tsawwassen Government law making authority in respect of expropriation
        and does not and is not intended to address the authority of a
        Provincial Expropriating Authority to expropriate under provincial
        legislation which authority is dealt with in the Lands chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. Tsawwassen Government may exercise authority over agriculture on
        Tsawwassen Lands through land use planning and zoning under subclause
        1.d.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. A Tsawwassen Law made under clause 1 prevails to the extent of a
        Conflict with a Federal or Provincial Law.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        6. Despite clause 5, a Federal or Provincial Law in respect of the
        division of matrimonial real property prevails to the extent of a
        Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of matrimonial
        real property made under subclause 1.a or 1.b. For greater certainty, a
        Tsawwassen Law that may restrict the Disposition of real property to a
        Tsawwassen Member is not a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of
        matrimonial real property.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        7. Despite clause 5, except in respect of the Former Tsawwassen Reserve
        and any other Tsawwassen Lands excluded from an agricultural land
        reserve designation, the
        <em> Agricultural Land Commission Act </em>
        prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law made under
        subclause 1.d.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        8. Despite clause 5, a Federal or Provincial Law in relation to
        Environmental Assessment prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a
        Tsawwassen Law made under subclause 1.h.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. A Tsawwassen Law under subclause 1.a or 1.b in respect of estates or
        interests that are recognized under Federal or Provincial Law must be
        consistent with common law principles in respect of those interests and,
        for greater certainty, a Tsawwassen Law in respect of a Tsawwassen Fee
        Simple Interest is not inconsistent with common law principles.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        10. Without limiting the scope of authority of Tsawwassen Government to
        make laws under this Agreement, before Tsawwassen Government makes a law
        under subclause 1.d, Tsawwassen First Nation will consult residents of
        Tsawwassen Lands who may be affected by the proposed law, through a
        process similar in principle to that required of a municipality
        undertaking similar law-making.

        Project on Tsawwassen Lands will proceed unless there has been
        compliance with any applicable Federal or Provincial Law in respect of
        Environmental Assessment.

        12. For greater certainty, Tsawwassen First Nation may establish

        developments.

        institutions that may address matters of shared decision-making, or
        benefiting from future provincial programs, policies or initiatives of

        relationship with First Nations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        14. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from

        general criteria established for those programs from time to time.

        Tsawwassen First Nation.

      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. Tsawwassen First Nation will be consulted and may participate in the

        5. In addition to any negotiation loan repayment amount required under

        All prepayments will be applied to the outstanding scheduled negotiation
        loan repayment amounts in consecutive order from the Effective Date.
        Tsawwassen First Nation will notify Canada in writing of a prepayment at

        6. The "n" anniversary for which a prepayment is to be applied will be

        prepayment applied to an outstanding negotiation loan repayment amount,
        or to a portion thereof, will be credited at its future value, as of the
        "n" anniversary, determined in accordance with the following formula:

        7. If the future value of the prepayment exceeds the outstanding amount
        of the negotiation loan repayment amount scheduled for the "n"
        anniversary, the excess will be deemed to be a prepayment made on the
        "n" anniversary so that the future value of the excess will be applied
        as of the next anniversary in a manner analogous to that described in
        this clause.

        8. On receipt of a prepayment, Canada will issue a letter to Tsawwassen

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        These notes will not form part of this Agreement. The purpose of these
        notes is to enable the Parties to calculate on the Revision Date the
        amounts to be shown in the final version of this Schedule.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        The provisional loan repayment amounts are based on total outstanding
        negotiation loans and interest accrued as of March 31, 2006. Final loan
        repayment amounts, including any further negotiation loans made and
        interest accrued after March 31, 2006, will be calculated and included
        in the final loan repayment schedule in accordance with the following
        notes.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">1. In these notes:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        <strong> "Revision Date" </strong>
        is the same as the Revision Date in Schedule 1.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. On the Revision Date, the provisional negotiation loan repayment
        amounts in the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan will be adjusted to final
        negotiation loan repayment amounts by:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. determining the amount of the additional negotiation loans made by
        Canada to Tsawwassen First Nation which were not included in the
        calculation of the provisional negotiation loan repayment amounts and
        any additional interest accrued since the provisional negotiation loan
        and interest amounts were calculated; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. pro-rating and adjusting the additional amounts determined in
        accordance with subclause 2.a of these notes for Tsawwassen First Nation
        and apply these amounts to the Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan such that
        the amounts in the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan are
        proportional to the amounts in the provisional Negotiation Loan
        Repayment Plan and such that the final Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan
        incorporates interest on unpaid loan balances, using 4.545% as an
        interest rate per year beginning at the Effective Date and compounded
        annually, which is the same rate of interest that was used to establish
        the provisional Negotiation Loan Repayment Plan.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. Canada will calculate the final negotiation loan repayment amounts
        based on a document that Canada and Tsawwassen First Nation will produce
        jointly before the Revision Date setting out the final negotiation loan
        and interest amounts and the relevant terms and conditions of the loans
        as at the Effective Date.

        4. On the Revision Date, following the adjustment performed in

      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. set out the contribution of Tsawwassen First Nation to the funding of

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. set out mechanisms for the transfer of funds to Tsawwassen First
        Nation from Canada or British Columbia;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">f. set out procedures for:</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. In negotiating a Fiscal Financing Agreement, the Parties will take
        into account:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the cost of providing, either directly or indirectly, the Agreed-Upon
        Programs and Services that are reasonably comparable to similar programs
        and services available in other communities of similar size and
        circumstance in south-western British Columbia;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. efficiency and effectiveness, including opportunities for economies
        of scale, in the provision of the Agreed-Upon Programs and Services,
        which may include, where appropriate, cooperative arrangements with
        other governments, First Nations or existing service providers;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">

        Tsawwassen First Nation under this Agreement;

        fiscal arrangements;

      <p class="schIndent2">j. other matters as agreed by the Parties.</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. From time to time, the Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach
        agreement on the own source revenue contribution of Tsawwassen First
        Nation to the funding of the Agreed-Upon Programs and Services under
        subclause 2.d, taking into account:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the capacity of Tsawwassen First Nation to generate revenues;

        source revenue in self government fiscal arrangements;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. that own source revenue arrangements should not unreasonably reduce
        incentives for Tsawwassen First Nation to generate revenues;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. that the reliance of Tsawwassen First Nation on fiscal transfers
        should decrease over time as it becomes more self-sufficient; and

      <p class="schIndent2">f. other matters as agreed by the Parties.</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. In negotiating the own source revenue contribution of Tsawwassen

        under clause 4, unless otherwise agreed:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">

        from Canada or British Columbia for a purpose related to the
        implementation of this Agreement and held in a special purpose fund as
        set out in the initial agreement in respect of own source revenues, or
        as agreed by the Parties from time to time, provided that the interest
        or income is used for a purpose or activity that is intended by the
        Parties to be funded from that special purpose fund;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        v. the payments received as a result of the settlement in 2004 relating

      <p class="schIndent3">ix. other sources agreed by the Parties; and</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. own source revenue arrangements will not permit:

        i. Canada to benefit from the decision of British Columbia to vacate tax
        room or to transfer revenues or tax authorities to Tsawwassen First
        Nation; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. British Columbia to benefit from the decision of Canada to vacate

        Nation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        6. If the Parties do not reach agreement on a subsequent Fiscal
        Financing Agreement by the expiry date of an existing Fiscal Financing
        Agreement, the existing Fiscal Financing Agreement:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. will continue in effect for up to two years from its original expiry
        date, or for such other period of time as the Parties may agree in

      <p class="schIndent2">b. will terminate on the earlier of:</p>

        ii. the date of commencement of a subsequent Fiscal Financing Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        7. The creation of Tsawwassen Government, the provision of Tsawwassen
        Government legislative authority under this Agreement, or the exercise
        of Tsawwassen Government legislative authority does not create or imply
        any financial obligation or service responsibility on the part of any
        Party, other than as set out in a Fiscal Financing Agreement.

        that agreement and Canada duly provides the Time Limited Federal
        Funding, Canada has no obligation to negotiate and attempt to reach
        agreement on the provision of further funding for any of the
        responsibilities specified.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. For greater certainty, where the Parties agree in the initial Fiscal
        Financing Agreement that British Columbia will provide Time Limited
        Provincial Funding for any Tsawwassen First Nation responsibilities

        30. An applicant or a Party may apply to the Supreme Court of British
        Columbia to review a decision of the enrolment appeal board on the
        grounds that the enrolment appeal board:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. acted without jurisdiction, acted beyond its jurisdiction or refused
        to exercise its jurisdiction;
      </p>

      <p class="schIndent2">c. erred in law; or</p>

        it.

        31. On an application for judicial review under clause 30, the court may

        any directions that the court considers appropriate.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        32. If the enrolment appeal board fails to hear or decide an appeal

        board to hear or decide the appeal, in accordance with any directions
        that the court considers appropriate.

          GENERAL
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">1. The Parties share the following objectives:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. to cooperate with each other to develop harmonious working
        relationships;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">b. to prevent or minimize Disagreements;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. to identify Disagreements quickly and resolve them in the most
        expeditious and cost-effective manner; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. to resolve Disagreements in a non-adversarial, collaborative and
        informal atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. Except as otherwise provided, participating Parties may agree to vary
        a procedural requirement contained in this chapter, or in Appendix P, as
        it applies to a particular Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. Participating Parties may agree to, or the Supreme Court of British
        Columbia, on application, may order:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. the abridgment of a time limit; or</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. In this chapter, and in Appendix P, a Party is deemed to be directly
        engaged in a Disagreement if another Party, acting reasonably, gives the
        first Party a written notice requiring it to participate in a process
        described in this chapter to resolve the Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. This chapter is not intended to apply to all conflicts or disputes
        between or among the Parties, but is limited to the conflicts or
        disputes described in clause 6.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">6. This chapter only applies to:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. a conflict or dispute in respect of:</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. the interpretation, application, or implementation of this Agreement,
        or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. a breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. a conflict or dispute, where provided for in this Agreement; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. negotiations required to be conducted under any provision of this
        Agreement that provides that the Parties, or any of them, "will
        negotiate and attempt to reach agreement".
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">7. This chapter does not apply to:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. an agreement between or among the Parties other than this Agreement,
        unless the Parties have agreed that this chapter applies to that
        agreement;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">b. the implementation plan; or</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. conflicts or disputes, where excluded from this chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        8. Nothing in this chapter limits the application of a dispute
        resolution process, under a Federal or Provincial Law, to a conflict or
        dispute involving a person if that conflict or dispute is not a
        Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. Nothing in a Federal Law or Provincial Law limits the right of a
        Party to refer a Disagreement to this chapter.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        10. The Parties desire and expect that most Disagreements will be
        resolved by informal discussions between or among the Parties, without
        the necessity of invoking this chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        11. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Disagreements not
        resolved informally will progress, until resolved, through the following
        stages:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. Stage One: formal, unassisted efforts to reach agreement between or
        among the Parties in collaborative negotiations under Appendix P-1;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. Stage Two: structured efforts to reach agreement between or among the
        Parties with the assistance of a Neutral, who has no authority to
        resolve the dispute, in a facilitated process under Appendix P-2, P-3,
        P-4 or P-5 as applicable; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. Stage Three: final adjudication in arbitral proceedings under
        Appendix P-6, or in judicial proceedings.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        12. Except as otherwise provided, no Party may refer a Disagreement to
        final adjudication in Stage Three without first proceeding through Stage
        One and a facilitated process in Stage Two as required in this chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        13. Nothing in this chapter prevents a Party from commencing arbitral or
        judicial proceedings at any time:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. to prevent the loss of a right to commence proceedings due to the
        expiration of a limitation period; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. to obtain interlocutory or interim relief that is otherwise available
        pending resolution of the Disagreement under this chapter.

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        14. If a Disagreement is not resolved by informal discussion and a Party
        directly engaged in the Disagreement wishes to invoke this chapter, that
        Party will deliver a written notice, as required under Appendix P-1, as
        soon as practicable to the other Parties, requiring the commencement of
        collaborative negotiations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        15. Upon receiving the notice under clause 14, a Party directly engaged
        in the Disagreement will participate in the collaborative negotiations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        16. A Party not directly engaged in the Disagreement may participate in
        the collaborative negotiations by giving written notice to the other
        Parties, preferably before the collaborative negotiations commence.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        17. If the Parties have commenced negotiations in the circumstances
        described in subclause 6.c then, for all purposes under this chapter,
        those negotiations will be deemed collaborative negotiations and the
        particular matter under negotiation will be considered a Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        18. Collaborative negotiations terminate in the circumstances set out in
        Appendix P-1.

        have not resolved the Disagreement, a Party directly engaged in a
        Disagreement by delivering a notice to the other Parties may require the
        commencement of a facilitated process.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">20. A notice under clause 19:</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. will include the name of the Party or Parties directly engaged in the
        Disagreement and a summary of the particulars of the Disagreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. may propose the use of a particular facilitated process described in
        clause 23.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        21. Upon receiving a notice under clause 19, a Party directly engaged in

      <p class="schIndent1">
        22. A Party not directly engaged in the Disagreement may participate in

        within 15 days of delivery of a notice under clause 19.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        23. Within 30 days after delivery of a notice under clause 19, the
        Parties directly engaged in the Disagreement will attempt to agree to
        use one of the following processes:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">a. mediation under Appendix P-2;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">b. technical advisory panel under Appendix P-3;</p>
      <p class="schIndent2">c. neutral evaluation under Appendix P-4;</p>

      <p class="schIndent1">

        mediation under Appendix P-2.

        approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
        provided that in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended
        emergency Hydro does not require the prior approval of the Grantor under

        approval of such work plan, and shall take into consideration the effect
        of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to the cost
        of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not undertaking the
        work. If Hydro and the Grantor, each acting reasonably, cannot agree on
        a work plan requested by Hydro within 30 days of receipt by the Grantor
        of the proposed work plan, then either party may refer the disagreement
        to dispute resolution under section 14.1 of this Agreement;

        order to protect the Works, or to protect persons or property that may
        be at risk from the Works, and in that event Hydro will as soon as
        reasonably possible thereafter notify the Grantor; and

        <strong> 3.0 Right of Way Area </strong>

        3.1 The parties acknowledge that they have made reasonable efforts to
        identify all the existing Works and related Right of Way Area as of the
        date of this Agreement. However, as there may still be some Works that
        were missed in the identification process the parties agree that for
        such Works the Grantor grants to Hydro for so long as required, a right
        of way over those portions of the Lands upon which such Works are
        located on the following terms:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) for such Works, Hydro holds the same rights, privileges and
        obligations as apply to Hydro for the use of the Right of Way Area and

        reasonable access over the Lands for the purpose of gaining access to
        such Works; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (b) the Grantor may at any time require Hydro to attach a revised survey
        plan to this Agreement to include those additional portions of the
        Lands.

        <strong> 4.0 Non-Exclusive Use </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        4.1 This Agreement will not entitle Hydro to exclusive possession of the
        Hydro Right of Way Area or other parts of the Lands and the Grantor
        reserves the right to grant other dispositions of any Lands affected by
        this Agreement, so long as the grant does not materially affect or
        interfere with the exercise of Hydro's rights under this Agreement.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        (b) Hydro shall keep the portions of the Lands used by Hydro under this
        Agreement in a safe, clean and sanitary condition to the extent the
        condition relates to the use or occupation of the Lands by Hydro, and on
        written notice from the Grantor, to make safe, clean, and sanitary any
        portion of them that contravene the provisions of this covenant,
        provided that Hydro has no obligation to keep any portion of the Lands
        suitable for use by anyone except Hydro;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (c) Hydro shall bury and maintain all underground works as may be
        required so as not to unduly interfere with the drainage of the Lands;

      <p class="schIndent1">
        (d) Hydro shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to minimize
        disturbance of any archaeological material discovered by Hydro on the
        Right of Way Area, and to immediately notify the Grantor;
      </p>

        the Grantor, except to the extent required by Hydro acting reasonably,
        to exercise its rights under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (g) Hydro shall permit the Grantor to enter upon the Right of Way Area
        at any time to examine its condition.

        <strong> 7.0 Work Plans </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        7.1 Except in the case of an emergency or reasonably apprehended
        emergency, Hydro will provide to the Grantor a written work plan
        describing the proposed work located on, outside or related to the Right
        of Way Area prior to undertaking any of the following work under this
        Agreement:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">(a) construction of any new Works;</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">(b) relocation of any Works; and</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (c) construction or relocation of any Access Improvements.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        In accordance with this section 7.1, prior to undertaking any work,
        Hydro will deliver a copy of the work plan to the Grantor for comment by
        the Grantor. The Grantor will no more than thirty (30) days after
        receiving the work plan, provide to Hydro in writing any comments that
        it may have, and Hydro will use reasonable efforts to accommodate any
        suggestions or requests presented by the Grantor to Hydro provided they
        do not result in delays, increased costs or technical difficulties.

        <strong> 8.0 Relocation of Works Due to Change </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        8.1 If a material change occurs to the Lands, such as erosion, which for
        any reason makes the continued use of any portion of the Right of Way
        Area or the Excluded Right of Way Area unsuitable for any of the Works,
        then the Grantor will consent to the relocation and replacement of such
        Works to a new location on the Lands, as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) Hydro will before undertaking any work, deliver a work plan to the
        Grantor indicating the contemplated relocation of the Works for approval
        by the Grantor, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
        delayed or conditioned;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (b) Hydro will take into account any likely material effect of the
        relocated Works on adjacent lands, and the Grantor will take into
        account the cost efficiencies of the location selected by Hydro for the
        relocated Works in relation to alternative locations;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (c) the relocated Works will be covered by the terms and conditions of
        this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (d) if Works are relocated from the Excluded Right of Way Area to the
        Lands Hydro will pay the Grantor the fair market value of the new Right

        the granting of such approval and shall take into consideration the
        effect of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to
        the cost of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not
        undertaking the work. If Terasen and the Grantor, each acting
        reasonably, cannot agree on a work plan within 30 days of receipt by the
        Grantor of the work plan proposed by Terasen, then either party may
        refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under section 17.1 of this

        feasible, to their condition prior to the implementation of the work
        plan or, at Terasen's discretion, pay to the Grantor appropriate
        compensation in respect of such damage.

        reasonable judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are
        imminent safety concerns or risk of public harm, Terasen may, without
        approval of the Grantor, undertake works and take such steps on the
        Lands as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to
        protect the Works located within the Lands or within an Excluded Area,
        or to protect persons and property that may be at risk from such Works,

        notify the Grantor.

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        A. Delta Cable will deliver to the Grantor for prior approval a written
        work plan describing the proposed work on the Lands;

        B. the Grantor will not unreasonably withhold or delay approval of such
        work plan and will not impose any unreasonable conditions relating to
        the granting of such approval and shall take into consideration the
        effect of the proposed work, the cost of the proposed work compared to
        the cost of alternate solutions and the extent of the risk of not
        undertaking the work. If Delta Cable and the Grantor, each acting
        reasonably, cannot agree on a work plan within 30 days of receipt by the
        Grantor of the work plan proposed by Delta Cable, then either party may
        refer the disagreement to dispute resolution under section 17.1 of this
        Agreement; and

        C. in the event that any damage to the Lands results from the
        implementation of the work plan by Delta Cable, Delta Cable will repair
        and restore the damaged portion of the Lands as near as is reasonably
        feasible, to their condition prior to the implementation of the work
        plan or, at Delta Cable's discretion, pay to the Grantor appropriate
        compensation in respect of such damage.

      <p align="left">
        2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Delta Cable determines in its
        reasonable judgment that an emergency situation exists or there are
        imminent safety concerns or risk of public harm, Delta Cable may,
        without approval of the Grantor, undertake works and take such steps on
        the Lands as are reasonably required to be taken immediately in order to
        protect the Works located within the Lands or within an Excluded Area,
        or to protect persons and property that may be at risk from such Works,
        and in that event Delta Cable will as soon as reasonably possible notify
        thereafter the Grantor.

        into an agreement whereby Tsawwassen First Nation ("TFN") would receive
        payment in the amount of $130,000 and the transfer of 13 acres of
        additional land in exchange for a right-of-way of 11.962 acres for

          Note: The parcel descriptions listed below are based on the most

          will be updated before the Effective Date following a survey of some
          or all of the parcels. In some cases, the parcel descriptions will be
          amended to include road dedications and the granting of rights of ways
          or easements for existing interests. This could result in the area of
          some or all of the parcels being slightly reduced and the
          corresponding titles being slightly more encumbered. Before the
          readying of the parcels for disposition, British Columbia will meet
          with Tsawwassen First Nation to discuss steps to be taken for readying
          the parcels for disposition.

      <p class="schIndent1">
        In any year, the Tsawwassen Fishing Right Allocation for sockeye salmon
        will be:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a) when the Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye
        salmon is 500 000 or less, 1.0% of the Canadian Total Allowable Catch
        for Fraser River sockeye salmon;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b) when the Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye
        salmon is greater than 500 000 and less than 3.0 million, then 5 000
        Fraser River sockeye salmon plus 0.40904% of that portion of the
        Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye that is greater
        than 500 000 and less than 3.0 million; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c) when the Canadian Total Allowable Catch for Fraser River sockeye

        In any year, the Tsawwassen Fishing Right Allocation for pink salmon
        will be that number of fish caught incidentally in the harvest of
        Tsawwassen Allocation for sockeye salmon, up to a maximum of 2 500
        Fraser River pink salmon.

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        In any year, the Tsawwassen Fishing Right Allocation for chinook salmon
        will be determined by an abundance based formula, based on Canadian
        Total Allowable Catch that produces an average annual harvest of 625
        Fraser River chinook salmon based on Fraser River chinook salmon returns
        for the 1982 to 2004 time period.

        <strong> Principles for Calculating Overages and Underages </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The procedures for calculating overages and underages for each Salmon
        species will be consistent with the following principles:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        a) where a Tsawwassen harvest exceeded the defined Tsawwassen Allocation
        for a Salmon species in a year, an overage has occurred for that species
        and the amount of that overage will be accounted for in the multi-year
        accounting process;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        b) where a Tsawwassen harvest was less than the defined Tsawwassen
        Allocation for a Salmon species in a year because another group
        harvested more than their harvest share for that species, an underage
        has occurred for that species and the amount of that underage will be
        accounted for in the multi-year accounting process;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        c) where a Tsawwassen harvest was less than the defined Tsawwassen
        Allocation for a Salmon species in a year due to uncertainty in the
        management process for that species, an underage has occurred for that
        species and a defined portion of that underage will be accounted for in
        the multi-year accounting process;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        d) where a Tsawwassen harvest was less than the defined Tsawwassen
        Allocation for a Salmon species in a year due to a lack of harvesting
        effort on the part of Tsawwassen, no underage has occurred for that
        species in that year; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        e) where Tsawwassen and Canada agree on an amount to be accounted or in
        the multi-year accounting process for overages and underages for a
        Salmon species, Tsawwassen and Canada will use that amount in the
        multi-year accounting process.

        10. If a Party commences legal proceedings in a court against another
        Party in respect of a matter required or agreed to be submitted to
        arbitration, a Party to the legal proceedings may, before or after
        entering an appearance, and before delivery of any pleadings or taking

        proceedings.

        <strong> INTERIM MEASURES BY COURT </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        13. It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a Party to
        request from a court, before or during arbitral proceedings, an interim
        measure of protection as provided in clause 13 of the Chapter, and for a
        court to grant that measure.

        chair before the Pre-Hearing Meeting, they shall so advise the Neutral
        Appointing Authority in writing and the Neutral Appointing Authority
        will select a chair.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        26. The Neutral Appointing Authority, in appointing an arbitrator or the
        chair of an arbitral tribunal, must have due regard to:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) any qualifications required of the arbitrator as set out in section
        18 or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (b) other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an
        independent and impartial arbitrator or chair.

      <p align="left">
        <strong> GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        27. When a person is approached in connection with possible appointment
        as an arbitrator, that person must provide a written statement:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) disclosing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable
        doubts as to their independence or impartiality; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (b) advising that the person is not aware of any circumstances of that
        nature and committing to disclose them if they arise or become known at
        a later date.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        28. An arbitrator, from the time of appointment and throughout the
        arbitral proceedings, must, without delay, disclose to the parties any
        circumstances referred to in section 26 unless the parties have already
        been informed of them.
      </p>
      <p align="left">29. An arbitrator may be challenged only if:</p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the
        arbitrator's independence or impartiality; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (b) the arbitrator does not possess the qualifications set out in this
        Appendix or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        30. A party may only challenge an arbitrator appointed by that party, or
        in whose appointment that party has participated, for reasons of which
        that party becomes aware after the appointment has been made.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        31. A person who is a Tsawwassen Member, or related to a Tsawwassen
        Member, may not be challenged under section 28 solely on the grounds of
        that membership or relationship.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <strong> CHALLENGE PROCEDURE </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        32. A party who intends to challenge an arbitrator will send to the
        arbitral tribunal a written statement of the reasons for the challenge
        within 15 days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral
        tribunal, or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in
        section 28.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        33. Unless the arbitrator challenged under section 31 withdraws from
        office, or the other parties agree to the challenge, the arbitral
        tribunal must decide on the challenge.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        34. If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or
        under the procedure under section 31 is not successful, the challenging
        party, within 30 days after having received notice of the decision
        rejecting the challenge, may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to
        decide on the challenge.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        35. The decision of the Neutral Appointing Authority under section 33 is
        final and is not subject to appeal.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        36. While a request under section 33 is pending, the arbitral tribunal,
        including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral
        proceedings and make an arbitral award unless:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the
        Neutral Appointing Authority is made would unduly prejudice the parties;

      <p class="schIndent1">(b) the parties agree otherwise.</p>

        <strong> FAILURE OR IMPOSSIBILITY TO ACT </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        37. The mandate of an arbitrator terminates if the arbitrator becomes
        unable at law, or as a practical matter, to perform the arbitrator's
        functions, or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        38. If a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to
        in section 36, a party may request the Neutral Appointing Authority to
        decide on the termination of the mandate.
      </p>

        <strong> TERMINATION OF MANDATE AND SUBSTITUTION OF ARBITRATOR </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        39. In addition to the circumstances referred to under sections 31 to
        33, and 36, the mandate of an arbitrator terminates:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) if the arbitrator withdraws from office for any reason; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (b) by, or pursuant to, agreement of the parties.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        40. If the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a replacement arbitrator
        must be appointed under sections 19 to 25, as applicable.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        41. If a single or chairing arbitrator is replaced, any hearings
        previously held must be repeated.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        42. If an arbitrator other than a single or chairing arbitrator is
        replaced, any hearings previously held may be repeated at the discretion
        of the arbitral tribunal.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        43. An order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made before the
        replacement of an arbitrator under section 39 is not invalid solely
        because there has been a change in the composition of the tribunal.

          COMPETENCE OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO RULE ON ITS JURISDICTION
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        44. An arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        45. A plea that an arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction must be
        raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; but a
        party is not precluded from raising that plea by the fact that the party
        has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        46. A plea that an arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its
        authority must be made as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the
        scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        47. An arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in
        section 44 or 45, admit a later plea if it considers the delay
        justified.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        48. An arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in section 44 or
        45 either as a preliminary question or in the arbitral award.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        49. If an arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has
        jurisdiction, any party, within 15 days after having received notice of
        that ruling, may request the Supreme Court to decide the matter.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        50. A decision of the Supreme Court under section 48 is final and is not
        subject to appeal.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        51. While a request under section 48 is pending, an arbitral tribunal
        may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award unless:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) the costs occasioned by proceeding before the decision of the

        <strong> INTERIM MEASURES ORDERED BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL </strong>
      </p>

        52. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may,
        at the request of a party, order a party to take any interim measure of
        protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of
        the subject matter of the Disagreement.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        53. The arbitral tribunal may require a party to provide appropriate

      <p align="left">
        <strong> EQUAL TREATMENT OF PARTIES </strong>
      </p>

        be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting the proceedings.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        56. Failing any agreement under section 54, the arbitral tribunal,

        considers appropriate.

      <p align="left">
        57. The arbitral tribunal is not required to apply the legal rules of

      </p>
      <p align="left">
        58. The arbitral tribunal must make all reasonable efforts to conduct

        <strong> PRE-HEARING MEETING </strong>

        agreement and to make any necessary orders on:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (a) any procedural issues arising under this Appendix;

        efficient and expeditious manner.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        61. The arbitral tribunal must prepare and distribute promptly to the
        parties a written record of all the business transacted, and decisions
        and orders made, at the pre-hearing meeting.
      </p>
      <p align="left">

        <strong> PLACE OF ARBITRATION </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        63. The arbitration will take place in the Province of British Columbia.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        64. Despite section 62, an arbitral tribunal may meet at any place it
        considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing
        witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods
        or other personal property, or for viewing physical locations.

        65. If the arbitral tribunal determines that it was necessary or

        and oral presentations in the circumstances of a particular
        Disagreement, the arbitral tribunal, on application of a party, may
        order that any of the costs of that translation be deemed to be costs of

        its defence or position in respect of those particulars.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        68. Each party must attach to its statement a list of documents:

      <p class="schIndent1">(a) the delay in making it; and</p>

        <strong> HEARINGS AND WRITTEN PROCEEDINGS </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        76. The arbitral tribunal must decide whether to hold hearings for the
        presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the

        materials.

        77. Unless the parties have agreed that no hearings will be held, the

        proceedings, if so requested by a party.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        78. The arbitral tribunal must give the parties sufficient advance
        notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for
        the purpose of inspection of documents, goods or other property or
        viewing any physical location.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        79. All statements, documents or other information supplied to, or
        applications made to, the arbitral tribunal by one party will be
        communicated to the other party, and any expert report or evidentiary
        document on which the arbitral tribunal may rely in making its decision
        must be communicated to the parties.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        80. Unless ordered by the arbitral tribunal, all hearings and meetings
        in arbitral proceedings, other than meetings of the arbitral tribunal,
        are open to the public.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        81. The arbitral tribunal must schedule hearings to be held on
        consecutive days until completion.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        82. All oral evidence must be taken in the presence of the arbitral
        tribunal and all the parties unless a party is absent by default or has
        waived the right to be present.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        83. The arbitral tribunal may order any individual to be examined by the
        arbitral tribunal under oath or on affirmation in relation to the
        Disagreement and to produce before the arbitral tribunal all relevant
        documents within the individual's care, custody or control.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        84. The document assemblies delivered under section 74 will be deemed to
        have been entered into evidence at the hearing without further proof and
        without being read out at the hearing, but a party may challenge the
        admissibility of any document so introduced.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        85. If the arbitral tribunal considers it just and reasonable to do so,
        the arbitral tribunal may permit a document that was not previously
        listed under section 67, or produced as required under section 70 or 74,
        to be introduced at the hearing, but the arbitral tribunal may take that
        failure into account when fixing the costs to be awarded in the
        arbitration.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        86. If the arbitral tribunal permits the evidence of a witness to be
        presented as a written statement, the other party may require that
        witness to be made available for cross examination at the hearing.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        87. The arbitral tribunal may order a witness to appear and give

        arbitral tribunal may terminate the proceedings.

      <p align="left">
        89. If, without showing sufficient cause, a respondent fails to

        failure in itself as an admission of the applicant's allegations.

        90. If, without showing sufficient cause, a party fails to appear at the

        before it.
