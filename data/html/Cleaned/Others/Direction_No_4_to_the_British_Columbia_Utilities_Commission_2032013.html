        Premises, at the Customer's election. A Customer with a Legacy Meter
        installed at the Customer's Premises can also elect to have a Smart
        Meter or a Radio-off Meter installed in place of the Legacy Meter at any

        installed at the Customer's Premises cannot later change back to a
        Legacy Meter at the applicable Premises.

        Radio-off Meter installed at the Customer's Premises as set out in the
        Schedule of Standard Charges from the date of BC Hydro's installation of
