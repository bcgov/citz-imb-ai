               In considering a biomass contract under section 71 (2) of the Act, the commission
        may not find that a biomass contract is not in the public interest solely by reason of the
        factor described in section 71 (2) (d) of the Act and must be primarily guided by the following
        factors, which are of material value to the authority's ratepayers:
