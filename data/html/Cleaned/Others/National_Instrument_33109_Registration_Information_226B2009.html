        For the administration of securities legislation or derivatives

        regulator or, in QuÃ©bec, the securities regulatory authority may require
        access to the business location to review the books, records and
        documents of the registered firm. If applicable, the SRO may also
        require access to the business location for the administration of the
        rules of the SRO.

      <p align="left">
        If the business location specified in this form is a residence, the

        enter the residence.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        If consent is not provided, it may affect the ability of the regulator,
        securities regulatory authority or SRO to access the books, records or
        documents of a registered firm and to determine whether securities
        legislation, derivatives legislation (including commodity futures
        legislation) or the rules of the SRO are being complied with. As a
        result, the regulator, securities regulatory authority or SRO may take
        action if it is unable to access and review the books, records or
        documents of a registered firm held at the business location.

      <p class="schIndent2">
        Your personal information is collected by, or on behalf of, each
        securities regulatory authority and SRO set out in Schedule A. Any of
        the securities regulatory authorities or SROs set out in Schedule A may

      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        This personal information is being collected under the authority of the
        applicable securities legislation, derivatives legislation (including
        commodity futures legislation) or both of the securities regulatory
        authorities and under the SRO rules of an SRO set out in Schedule A. The
        collection, use and disclosure are done in accordance with applicable
        freedom of information and privacy legislation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The principal purpose of this collection by the securities regulatory
        authorities is to administer, enforce, carry out their duties or
        exercise their powers under their respective securities legislation,
        derivatives legislation (including commodity futures legislation) or
        both, and by the SROs to administer and enforce the rules of the SROs.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        The information submitted by you in this form with your consent, or

        firm or are not a permitted individual of the sponsoring firm.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        If you have any questions about the collection, use and disclosure of
        this information, contact the securities regulatory authority or SRO in
        any jurisdiction in which the required information is submitted. See
        Schedule A for details.

        Certain information, such as your name(s) (including aliases, trade
        names or some past names), your sponsoring firm, and other relevant

        information under the rules of the SROs. This consent and notice does
        not limit the authority, powers, obligations or rights conferred on any
        of the securities regulatory authorities by legislation or regulations
        in effect in their jurisdiction.

        <strong> Line 5. Related-party Debt </strong>
        â€” Refer to the CPA Canada Handbook for the definition of "related party"
        for publicly accountable enterprises. The firm is required to deliver a
        copy of the executed subordination agreement to the regulator or, in
        QuÃ©bec, the securities regulatory authority on the earlier of (a) 10
        days after the date the agreement is executed or (b) the date an amount
        subordinated by the agreement is excluded from its calculation of excess
        working capital on Form 31-103F1
        <em> Calculation of Excess Working Capital </em>
        .
        <strong>
          The firm must notify the regulator or, in QuÃ©bec, the securities
          regulatory authority, 10 days before it repays the loan (in whole or
          in part), or terminates the subordination agreement.
        </strong>

        <strong> Line 8. Minimum Capital </strong>
        â€” The amount on this line must be not less than (a) $25,000 for an
        adviser and (b) $50,000 for a dealer. For an investment fund manager,
        the amount must be not less than $100,000 unless subsection 12.1 (4) of

        instructions set out in Schedule 1 to Form 31-103F1
        <em> Calculation of Excess Working Capital </em>
        . A schedule supporting the calculation of any amounts included in Line
        9 as market risk should be provided to the regulator or, in QuÃ©bec, the
        securities regulatory authority in conjunction with the submission of
        Form 31-103F1

        <strong> Line 11. Guarantees </strong>
        â€” If the registered firm is guaranteeing the liability of another party,
        the total amount of the guarantee must be included in the capital
        calculation. If the amount of a guarantee is included in the firm's
        statement of financial position as a current liability and is reflected
        in Line 4, do not include the amount of the guarantee on Line 11.

        <strong> Line 12. Unresolved Differences </strong>
        â€” Any unresolved differences that could result in a loss from either
        firm or client assets must be included in the capital calculation. The
        examples below provide guidance as to how to calculate unresolved
        differences:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (i) If there is an unresolved difference relating to client securities,
        the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the fair value of

        for those securities.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (ii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to the registrant's
        investments, the amount to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the
        fair value of the investments (securities) that are short.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        (iii) If there is an unresolved difference relating to cash, the amount
        to be reported on Line 12 will be equal to the amount of the shortfall
        in cash.
