               Despite any other provision of this Part and without limiting section 7 of the Waste Discharge Regulation, a director may impose a greater setback than is otherwise required under this Part, or impose a setback where none is otherwise required under this Part, if the director has reason to believe that contaminated runoff, leachate or solids are or may be entering a drinking water source or watercourse, or crossing a property boundary.
