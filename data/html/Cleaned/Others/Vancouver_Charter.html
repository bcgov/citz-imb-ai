          In any year, before the estimates are adopted, the Council may
          nevertheless authorize such expenditures as are necessary to carry on
          the business of the city, but such expenditures shall in no case
          exceed the amounts expended in the previous year for the like
          purposes, save where not less than two-thirds of all the members of
          the Council concur in such excess expenditure.

          The Council, without the assent of the electors, may by by-law
          authorize the Director of Finance or some other person to borrow on
          behalf of the city for such period as Council may deem fit by way of
          promissory note or overdraft such sum of money as Council may deem
          necessary to meet the lawful expenditures of the city pending the
          collection of real-property taxes and amounts receivable from other
          governments. In any such by-law, the Council may provide for the
          hypothecation, subject to any prior charge thereon, to the lender, of
          any amounts receivable from other governments and the whole or any
          part of the real-property taxes then remaining unpaid, together with
          the whole or part of the real-property taxes to be levied for the year
          in which the by-law is passed. Provided, however, that if the by-law
          is passed before the passing of the rating by-law, the amount of the
          current taxes that may be hypothecated shall be not more than
          seventy-five per centum of the real-property taxes levied in the next
          preceding year.

          In assessing annual rental value, all factors shall be taken into
          account so that as far as possible premises similar in size,
          suitability, advantage of location, and the like shall be equally
          assessed. The intent and purpose of this section is that all persons
          subject to business tax shall be assessed at a fair rental value of
          the premises occupied or used, based in general upon rents being
          actually paid for similar premises.

          shall cancel any charge or encumbrance registered against the parcel

          The development cost levy may be based on a rate per foot on the
          length of the longest boundary of the parcel with respect to which the
          levy is imposed, the number of units, or the number of square feet
          permitted by the building permit in the development with respect to
          which the levy is imposed, or on such other basis as Council deems
          appropriate having regard to anticipated development rights and their
          contribution to the need for capital projects. The basis of
          development cost levies may vary for different capital projects. A
          development cost levy under this Part shall not be based on a
          percentage of the cost of a development. A development cost levy for
          any development as shown on an application for a development permit
          shall not exceed 10% of the value of the development as determined
          pursuant to the building by-law from time to time in force.

          The development cost levy shall be calculated with reference to the

          place in stages, the total development cost levy shall be apportioned

          contained in subsection (13), the portion of the levy to be paid on
          the issuance of each building permit shall, until the total levy is
          paid, be 10% of the value of the work authorized by the permit as

          Despite subsection (1), an owner of property for which a permit has
          been withheld before the adoption of a by-law designating a heritage
          property may agree that a permit may be withheld for a period longer

          subsection (1) continues to apply during that longer period and
