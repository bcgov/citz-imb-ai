          (1) The objective of the short form prospectus is to provide
          information concerning the issuer that an investor needs in order to
          make an informed investment decision. This Form sets out specific
          disclosure requirements that are in addition to the general
          requirement under securities legislation to provide full, true and
          plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities to
          be distributed. Certain rules of specific application impose
          prospectus disclosure obligations in addition to those described in
          this Form.

          (2) Terms used and not defined in this Form that are defined or

          interpretation. Other definitions are set out in NI 14-101.

        <em>
          (3) In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of
          materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgement in
          the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an
          item's significance to investors, analysts and other users of
          information. An item of information, or an aggregate of items, is
          considered material if it is probable that its omission or
          misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with
          respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information
          is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative
          factors. The potential significance of items must be considered
          individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an
          offsetting effect.

          the short form prospectus. Details concerning the price and other
          matters dependent upon or relating to price, such as the number of

          prospectus any document incorporated by reference. If an excerpt of a
          document is incorporated by reference, clearly identify the excerpt in
