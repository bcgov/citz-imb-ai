               The development cost levy may be based on a rate per foot on the length of the longest boundary of the parcel with respect to which the levy is imposed, the number of units, or the number of square feet permitted by the building permit in the development with respect to which the levy is imposed, or on such other basis as Council deems appropriate having regard to anticipated development rights and their contribution to the need for capital projects. The basis of development cost levies may vary for different capital projects. A development cost levy under this Part shall not be based on a percentage of the cost of a development. A development cost levy for any development as shown on an application for a development permit shall not exceed 10% of the value of the development as determined pursuant to the building by-law from time to time in force.

               The development cost levy shall be calculated with reference to the information contained on the application for a development permit or to records contained in the Land Title Office. Where development takes place in stages, the total development cost levy shall be apportioned and paid as each building permit is issued. Subject to the limitation contained in subsection (13), the portion of the levy to be paid on the issuance of each building permit shall, until the total levy is paid, be 10% of the value of the work authorized by the permit as determined pursuant to the building by-law.
