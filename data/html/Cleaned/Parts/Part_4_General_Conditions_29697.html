              The lux is the metric unit of light measurement, and replaces the
              footcandle (fc), which was the traditional imperial unit of
              measurement. One lux equals about one tenth of a footcandle. For
              example, the minimum illumination in footcandles for task category
              number 4, which is common in the office environment, is about 50
              footcandles.
