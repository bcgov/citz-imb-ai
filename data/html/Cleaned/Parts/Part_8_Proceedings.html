               If, in a legal proceeding against a director, officer, receiver, receiver manager or liquidator of a company, the court finds that that person is or may be liable in respect of negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, the court must take into consideration all of the circumstances of the case, including those circumstances connected with the person's election or appointment, and may relieve the person, either wholly or partly, from liability, on the terms the court considers necessary, if it appears to the court that, despite the finding of liability, the person has acted honestly and reasonably and ought fairly to be excused.
