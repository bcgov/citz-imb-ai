               The Council may pass by-laws for contracting debts by borrowing money or otherwise for any authorized purpose, in such currencies whether of Canada or some other country as the Council deems expedient, and for levying taxes on the real property in the city liable to taxation for the payment of such debts, but the aggregate of the debt so contracted shall not at any time be increased so as to exceed twenty per centum of the total assessed value of such real property calculated upon the average assessment for the two years prior to the year in which the by-law is passed. The debentures issued therefor may be made payable at such places, within or without Canada, and in such currencies, whether of Canada or some other country, as the Council deems expedient, and if the debentures are, or have been, made payable in lawful money of the United States of America, a dollar so payable shall, for the purpose of such calculation or of any other calculation directed towards ascertaining whether or not any proposed borrowing is within the power of Council, be deemed to be the equivalent of a dollar payable in lawful money of Canada.

               Council, without the assent of the electors, may, by by-law, authorize the Director of Finance or some other person to borrow on behalf of the city by way of promissory note or overdraft such sum of money as Council may deem necessary to meet the lawful expenditures of the city pending the sale of debentures. In any such by-law the Council may provide for the hypothecation to the lender of the proceeds of such debentures for the repayment of the sum borrowed and interest thereon.
