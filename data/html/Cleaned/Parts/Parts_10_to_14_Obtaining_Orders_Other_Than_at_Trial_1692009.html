               If a witness is dead, or is unable to attend and testify because of age, infirmity, sickness or imprisonment or is out of the jurisdiction or his or her attendance cannot be secured by subpoena, the court may permit a transcript of any evidence of that witness taken in any proceeding, hearing or inquiry at which the evidence was taken under oath, whether or not involving the same parties, to be put in as evidence, but reasonable notice must be given of the intention to give that evidence.

               In a family law case in which evidence or argument is taken down by an official reporter or is recorded digitally or on audio tape, it is the duty of the claimant, if required by the court, to furnish the court with a certified transcript of the evidence or argument or any portion of it, the costs of which form part of the costs of the family law case, but if payment of the costs of providing a transcript would be a hardship on a party, the court may order that the transcript be prepared at the expense of the government.
