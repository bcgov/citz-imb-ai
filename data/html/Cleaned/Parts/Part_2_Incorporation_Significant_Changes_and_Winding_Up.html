               If a fraternal society transacts endowment or expectancy insurance and has an endowment fund separate and distinct from its life insurance fund, the society, by resolution passed at a general meeting after at least one month's notice of the intended resolution, may determine that the endowment or expectancy be discontinued, with the endowment or expectancy fund, as the case may be, to be distributed proportionately among the society's members then in good standing who are contributing to the fund, to each member according to the member's total contribution.

               Subject to first receiving the written approval of the superintendent, the fraternal society may proceed to ascertain the persons entitled to rank on distribution of the fund and may distribute the fund among those entitled, and the distribution discharges the society from all liability in respect of the fund, and of the endowment or expectancy contracts undertaken by the society.

               If all the members interested in the endowment or expectancy fund are also interested as holders of life insurance contracts, members at the general meeting, instead of determining that the endowment or expectancy fund be distributed, by resolution passed at the meeting, may determine that the fund be converted into or merged in a life insurance fund, and then, subject to the superintendent first approving the resolution, the endowment or expectancy fund becomes a life insurance fund.

               If dividends are paid by a trust company, insurance company or holding company in respect of voting shares in the company that are at the time of the dividend held by a person who holds them consequent to an acquisition made in contravention of section 50, the company has a cause of action for the recovery of the amount of the dividends paid against the members to whom they were paid whether or not the company had knowledge of the contravention.

               Despite subsection (1), the directors may authorize the payment of a dividend in respect of any voting shares to a person who would otherwise be disentitled to the dividend under that subsection if in the directors' opinion the contravention was inadvertent or of a technical nature; and a dividend so authorized and paid is not recoverable under subsection (2).
