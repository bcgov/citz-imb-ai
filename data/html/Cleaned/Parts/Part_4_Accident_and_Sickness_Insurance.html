          An insurer does not incur any liability for any default, error or
          omission in giving or withholding information as to any notice or
          instrument that it has received and that affects the insurance money.

          The insurer must not in the policy give undue prominence to any
          provision or statutory condition as compared to other provisions or
          statutory conditions, unless the effect of that provision or statutory
          condition is to increase the premium or decrease the benefits
          otherwise provided for in the policy.

          An officer, agent or employee of an insurer, or a person soliciting
          insurance whether or not an agent of the insurer, must not be
          considered to be the agent of the insured, person insured, group
          person insured or debtor insured, to that person's prejudice, in
          respect of any question arising out of a contract.
