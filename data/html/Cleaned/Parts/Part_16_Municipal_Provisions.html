               On the redemption of land by a council under this section, it may add the amount of the redemption payment made by it to the amount of municipal taxes in arrear in respect of the land, and the amount added is deemed to be delinquent taxes under this Act.

               If land subject to forfeiture referred to in subsection (1) has not been redeemed, but has been forfeited to and vested in the Provincial government, the council may purchase the land under the terms of any Act that provides for sale of the forfeited land to the municipality.

               Despite the sale of land referred to in subsection (1) by the Surveyor of Taxes or by the Inspector of Dikes for the recovery of taxes, assessments or other charges in arrear, the land continues to be liable to taxation by the municipality in which it is located.
