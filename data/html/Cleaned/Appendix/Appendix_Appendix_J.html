         <p class="schIndent1">
            1. Provincial Law applies to the expropriation of Tla'amin Lands by a Provincial Expropriating Authority except to the extent that this Agreement modifies its application.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            2. A Provincial Expropriating Authority may expropriate an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands only with the consent and by the order of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            3. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may issue an order consenting to an expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands only:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. after the conclusion of the procedures described in Sections 4 and 5: and
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            b. where the expropriation is justifiable in accordance with Section 6.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            4. Before the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council makes a decision under Section 3, the Provincial Expropriating Authority will provide to the Tla'amin Nation a report which states the reasons for the expropriation and addresses the factors under Sections 6. a and 6. d.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            5. Within 30 days of receipt of the report under Section 4, Tla'amin Nation will notify the Provincial Expropriating Authority if it objects to the expropriation of the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands and, within 30 days of the Provincial Expropriating Authority's receipt of notice from the Tla'amin Nation, the Provincial Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation will make reasonable efforts to resolve the objection raised by the Tla'amin Nation.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            6. For the purposes of Section 3. b an expropriation is justifiable where the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council is satisfied that, in addition to the applicable requirements under Provincial Law, the following requirements have been met:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative to the expropriation, including the use of lands that are not Tla'amin Lands;

            c. the Provincial Expropriating Authority has confirmed that the proposed expropriation is the smallest estate or interest necessary and for the shortest time required;
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that would be protected from disclosure under Provincial Law, has been provided to the Tla'amin Nation, including the report referred to in Section 5; and
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            e. where the Tla'amin Nation has objected to the expropriation, reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the objection.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            7. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council will not consent to the expropriation before the end of the period provided for in Section 5.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            8. Notwithstanding Sections 3 to 7, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may consent to the expropriation if the Minister or Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council has declared a state of emergency.

            </strong>
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            9. In the event an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands is expropriated by a Provincial Expropriating Authority, the Provincial Expropriating Authority will provide compensation in accordance with this Agreement.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            10. The total value of compensation for an expropriated estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands will be based on the criteria set out in Provincial Law.
         </p>

            11. Where the Provincial Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation disagree on the total value of compensation for an expropriated estate or interest held by the Tla'amin Nation, the dispute will be finally determined by arbitration. A dispute under this Section will not delay the expropriation. For the purposes of this Section British Columbia will act on behalf of the Provincial Expropriating Authority on such terms as British Columbia and the Provincial Expropriating Authority may agree.

         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. there is no other reasonably feasible alternative land to expropriate that is not Tla'amin Lands;
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            b. reasonable efforts have been made by the Federal Expropriating Authority to acquire the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands through agreement with the Tla'amin Nation;
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            c. the smallest estate or interest necessary in Tla'amin Lands and for the shortest time required for the purpose for which the interest in land is sought is expropriated; and
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            d. information relevant to the expropriation, other than documents that would be protected from disclosure under Federal Law, has been provided to the Tla'amin Nation.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            4. Prior to the Governor-in-Council issuing an order consenting to the expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands, the Federal Expropriating Authority will provide to the Tla'amin Nation and the Governor-in-Council, and make available to the public, a report stating the justification for the expropriation and describing the steps taken to satisfy the requirements of Section 3.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            5. Where the Tla'amin Nation objects to the expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands, it may, within 60 days after the report has been provided to the Tla'amin Nation in accordance with Section 4 refer the dispute directly to neutral evaluation under Stage Two of the Dispute Resolution Chapter for a review of the steps taken to satisfy the requirement set out Section 3.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            6. The Federal Expropriating Authority will not seek Governor-in-Council consent to the expropriation of an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. before the expiration of the period referred to in Section 5;
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            b. where the Tla'amin Nation has referred the dispute to a neutral evaluator in accordance with Section 5, before:

         <p class="schIndent3">
            i. the neutral evaluator has delivered to Tla'amin Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority an opinion on the dispute, such opinion to be rendered within 60 days of the referral being made; and
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent3">
            ii. the Federal Expropriating Authority has delivered the opinion of the neutral evaluator to the Governor-in-Council for consideration under Sections 1 and 2; or

         <p class="schIndent2">
            c. within such additional time as the Tla'amin Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority may agree.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            7. Without limiting the generality of the Dispute Resolution Chapter, the opinion of the neutral evaluator under Section 6:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. is without prejudice to the legal positions that may be taken by a Federal Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation in court or in any other forum;
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            b. will not be admissible in any legal proceedings, unless otherwise required by law; and
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            c. is not binding on the Governor-in-Council under Sections 1 and 3.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            8. At the time of the expropriation the Tla'amin Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority will negotiate the terms and conditions of the return of an expropriated estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands, including requirements relating to financial considerations based on fair market value and the condition of the land to be returned.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            9. Where the terms and conditions of the return of an expropriated estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands cannot be agreed upon by the Tla'amin Nation and the Federal Expropriating Authority at the time of the expropriation, the dispute will be finally determined by arbitration under the Dispute Resolution Chapter. For the purposes of this Section, Canada will act on behalf of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            10. Where a fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands is expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority, the Federal Expropriating Authority will make reasonable efforts to:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. identify replacement land of equivalent or greater size and comparable value within the Tla'amin Area, being either federal Crown land or lands available on a willing-seller willing-buyer basis; and

         <p class="schIndent2">
            b. where acceptable to the Tla'amin Nation, to acquire and offer the replacement land to the Tla'amin Nation as partial or full compensation for the expropriation.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            11. Subject to Section 15, if the replacement land identified by the Federal Expropriating Authority would result in the total size of Tla'amin Lands being less than at the Effective Date and the Tla'amin Nation does not agree that the replacement land is of comparable value to the estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands being expropriated, the Tla'amin Nation may refer the dispute to be finally determined by arbitration under the Dispute Resolution Chapter.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            12. Where the Federal Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation are unable to agree on the provision of replacement land as compensation, the Federal Expropriating Authority will provide the Tla'amin Nation with other compensation in accordance with this Agreement.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            13. The total value of compensation for an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands expropriated by a Federal Expropriating Authority under this Appendix will be determined by taking into account the following factors:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. the fair market value of the expropriated estate or interest;

            c. any expenses or losses resulting from the disturbance directly attributable to the expropriation;

         <p class="schIndent2">
            d. any reduction in the value of any estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands that is not expropriated which directly relates to the expropriation;

            e. any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of Tla'amin Lands in which an estate or interest has been expropriated provided that:

         <p class="schIndent3">
            i. the cultural or other special value is only applied to an estate or interest in Tla'amin Lands recognized in law and held by the Tla'amin Nation; and

         <p class="schIndent3">
            ii. there will be no increase in the total value of compensation on account of any aboriginal rights, title or interest; and

            f. the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or incidental to the occupation or use of Tla'amin Lands to the extent that the value is not otherwise compensated.

         <p class="schIndent1">
            14. Subject to Section 15, if the Federal Expropriating Authority and the Tla'amin Nation cannot agree on the total value of compensation or on whether the combination of replacement land and other compensation is equal to the total value of compensation, either Canada acting on behalf of the Federal Expropriating Authority or the Tla'amin Nation may refer the dispute for resolution under the Dispute Resolution Chapter.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            15. A dispute in respect of:

         <p class="schIndent1">
            17. Interest on compensation is payable from the date the expropriation takes effect at the interest rate payable under Federal Law.

            18. Where a Federal Expropriating Authority expropriates a fee simple estate in a parcel of Tla'amin Lands, the lands will no longer be Tla'amin Lands and Appendix C will be amended in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 9 of the Amendment Chapter.

            a. the parcel of lands retains its status as Tla'amin Lands;

         <p class="schIndent2">
            c. the Tla'amin Nation may continue to use and occupy the parcel of lands, except to the extent the use or occupation is inconsistent with the use of the parcel for which the expropriation took place, in the view of the Federal Expropriating Authority.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            20. Where replacement land is transferred to the Tla'amin Nation as partial or full compensation in accordance with Section 10, the Tla'amin Nation may request that land be added to Tla'amin Lands.

         <p class="schIndent1">
            21. Canada and British Columbia will consent to the land referred to in Section 20 being added to Tla'amin Lands where:

            a. the land is within the Tla'amin Area;

         <p class="schIndent1">
            23.

         <p class="schIndent1">
            27. The federal department or agency or other entity that holds the expropriated estate or interest may decide, without the consent of the Governor-in-Council, that the expropriated estate or interest in land is no longer required and may determine the disposition of any improvements made to the land in a manner consistent with an agreement reached under Section 8 or the outcome of an arbitration under Section 9.
