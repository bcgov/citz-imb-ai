            If I am concerned about the validity of the will, I am entitled to file a Notice of Dispute at any time and may choose to do so before the expiry of the 21-day notice period referred to in Form P1 Notice of Proposed Application in Relation to Estate, in order to prevent a grant from issuing to you, so that I have time to assess the electronic will. A Notice of Dispute filed must not be removed until it expires or is withdrawn by me or by order of the court.
