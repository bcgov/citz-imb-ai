               Note: The parcel descriptions listed below are based on the most accurate information available to define the parcels. The information will be updated before the Effective Date following a survey of some or all of the parcels. In some cases, the parcel descriptions will be amended to include road dedications and the granting of rights of ways or easements for existing interests. This could result in the area of some or all of the parcels being slightly reduced and the corresponding titles being slightly more encumbered. Before the readying of the parcels for disposition, British Columbia will meet with Tsawwassen First Nation to discuss steps to be taken for readying the parcels for disposition.
