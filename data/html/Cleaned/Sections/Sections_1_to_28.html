        <p>
          WHEREAS the recognition and reconciliation of the prior presence of
          Aboriginal peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of
          significant social and economic importance to all British Columbians;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is
          best achieved through negotiation and agreement, rather than through
          litigation;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS, in order to achieve this reconciliation, representatives
          of the Tla'amin Nation, Canada and British Columbia have negotiated
          the Tla'amin Final Agreement in a process facilitated by the British
          Columbia Treaty Commission;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS British Columbia is building a New Relationship with First
          Nations and working to close the social and economic gaps that exist
          between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Tla'amin Final Agreement embodies the principles of
          this New Relationship, including mutual respect, recognition and
          reconciliation of Aboriginal rights and title;
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHEREAS the Tla'amin Final Agreement requires that British
          Columbia enact legislation to give effect to the Tla'amin Final
          Agreement;
        </p>
        <p>
