               Nothing in this Act is to be construed as requiring that recognition or effect be
          given to a trust or a severable aspect of a trust if the significant elements of the trust
          or aspect, other than the settlor's choice of law, are most closely connected with a
          jurisdiction the law of which does not provide for the type of trust or aspect
