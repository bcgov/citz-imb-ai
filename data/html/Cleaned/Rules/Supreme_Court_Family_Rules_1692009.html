               Subject to subrule (2), a person wholly discontinuing a family law case against a party or wholly withdrawing his or her response to family claim filed in response to a notice of family claim of a party must pay the costs of that party to the date of service of the notice of discontinuance or the notice of withdrawal, as the case may be, and if a claimant who is liable for costs under this subrule subsequently brings a proceeding for the same or substantially the same claim before paying those costs, the court may order the proceeding to be stayed until the costs are paid.

            1  The receiver and the surety hereby jointly and severally covenant with Her Majesty the Queen in right of British Columbia that the receiver will, from time to time, duly account for what the receiver has already received since the date of the order appointing the receiver and will hereafter receive or for what since the date of the order the receiver has or will hereafter become liable to pay or account for as receiver [

            3  A statement under the hand of the registrar of the amount that the receiver is liable to pay and has not paid under paragraph 1 and that the loss or damage has been incurred through the act or default of the receiver is conclusive evidence in any action by Her Majesty against the receiver and surety, or either of them, or by the surety against the receiver, of the truth of the contents of the statement and constitutes a binding charge not only against the receiver and the receiver's personal representatives, but also against the surety and its funds and property without it being necessary for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the surety and the surety's funds and property and without it being necessary for Her Majesty to take any proceedings against the receiver for the recovery thereof and without any further or other proof being given in that behalf in any action to enforce this guarantee.

            4  The liability of the surety under this guarantee is limited to the sum noted above, provided that the registrar may give his or her approval in writing to the reduction of the liability of the surety, in which event the surety's maximum liability with respect to any acts or omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of the approval is reduced accordingly and provided further that an endorsement executed by the surety increasing the liability of the surety will be binding on the surety with respect to any acts or omissions of the receiver subsequent to the date of that endorsement.
