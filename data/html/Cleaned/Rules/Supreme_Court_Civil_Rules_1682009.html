               A defendant in an action may set off or set up by way of counterclaim any right or claim, whether the set-off or counterclaim is for damages or not, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final judgment on all claims in the same action.

               If a witness is dead, or is unable to attend and testify because of age, infirmity, sickness or imprisonment or is out of the jurisdiction or his or her attendance cannot be secured by subpoena, the court may permit a transcript of any evidence of that witness taken in any proceeding, hearing or inquiry at which the evidence was taken under oath, whether or not involving the same parties, to be put in as evidence, but reasonable notice must be given of the intention to give that evidence.

               In an action in which evidence or argument is taken down by an official reporter or is recorded digitally or on audio tape, it is the duty of the plaintiff, if required by the court, to furnish the court with a certified transcript of the evidence or argument or any portion of it, the costs of which form part of the costs of the action, but if payment of the costs of providing a transcript would be a hardship on a party, the court may order that the transcript be prepared at the expense of the government.

               If, after December 31, 2006, a settlement is reached under which payment of assessed costs is agreed to or an order for costs is made, and if no scale is fixed or agreed to in that settlement or order, the costs must be assessed under Scale B, unless a party, on application, obtains an order of the court that the costs be assessed under another scale.

               If, after it fixes the scale of costs applicable to a proceeding under subsection (1) or (4), the court finds that, as a result of unusual circumstances, an award of costs on that scale would be grossly inadequate or unjust, the court may order that the value for each unit allowed for that proceeding, or for any step in that proceeding, be 1.5 times the value that would otherwise apply to a unit in that scale under section 3 (1).

               For the purposes of subsection (5) of this section, an award of costs is not grossly inadequate or unjust merely because there is a difference between the actual legal expenses of a party and the costs to which that party would be entitled under the scale of costs fixed under subsection (1) or (4).
