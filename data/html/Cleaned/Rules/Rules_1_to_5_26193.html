          The purpose of these rules is to make it as easy as possible for
          people to use the court to resolve their disputes. If necessary, there
          will be a trial and a judge or a justice will decide the claim.
          However, both sides are encouraged to try to come to an agreement. A
          settlement is always possible, even after a judge or a justice has
          made a decision.
