        <strong> 1. </strong>
        On the effective date, the total rights of way area of the British

        <strong> 2. </strong>
        After the effective date, the Nisg̱a'a Nation or a Nisg̱a'a Village, on
        request by British Columbia, will grant to British Columbia, or to a
        public utility, rights of way on Nisg̱a'a Lands for public purposes,
        including provincial secondary roads or public utilities, in order to
        provide access or service to Nisg̱a'a Lands or other lands, subject to
        the following:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. any grant must be on reasonable terms including the location of the
        requested right of way, its width considering the intended use, its
        effect on neighbouring lands, and payment of fair compensation;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. British Columbia is not entitled to a grant under this paragraph if,
        on the date of the request, the total of the rights of way areas of all
        British Columbia rights of way plus the area of the requested grant
        would exceed the aggregate right of way maximum;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. if any British Columbia right of way, or a portion of a British
        Columbia right of way, terminates, the right of way area of the
        terminated right of way will be excluded from the calculation of the
        total of the rights of way areas of all the British Columbia rights of
        way for the purposes of calculating British Columbia's entitlement in
        respect of the aggregate right of way maximum; and

      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. if any dispute arises between British Columbia and the Nisg̱a'a Nation

        paragraph, including a dispute in respect of British Columbia's
        entitlement to the grant of a right of way for itself or for a public
        utility, or a dispute in respect of the terms of the grant, then any
        party to that dispute may refer the dispute to be finally determined by
        arbitration under Stage Three of the Dispute Resolution Chapter without
        having to proceed through Stage Two. The arbitrator's decision will be
        final on all matters in dispute, but the arbitrator will not have the
        authority to require British Columbia or a public utility to accept a
        grant of a right of way.

        <strong> 7. </strong>
        Any right of way, other interest, or licence, granted under this Chapter
