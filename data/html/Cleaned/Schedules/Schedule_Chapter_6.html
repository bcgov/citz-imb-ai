          POWER TO MAKE LAWS
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. Tsawwassen Government may make laws in respect of:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. the creation, ownership and Disposition of a Tsawwassen Fee Simple
        Interest;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. the ownership and Disposition of estates or interests in Tsawwassen
        Lands including:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">i. fee simple interests;</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">ii. mortgages;</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">iii. leases;</p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        iv. licences, permits, easements and rights of way, including rights of
        way and covenants similar to those in sections 218 and 219 of the
        <em> Land Title Act </em>
        ; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        v. any conditions or restrictions on such estates or interests.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. the ownership and Disposition of rights of access to any Tsawwassen
        Lands to certain Tsawwassen Members for cultural purposes, including
        gathering, and the recording of such rights of access by Tsawwassen
        First Nation in accordance with arrangements made by Tsawwassen First
        Nation with interest holders on Tsawwassen Lands;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        d. the management and use of Tsawwassen Lands, including planning,
        zoning and development;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        e. the establishment and operation of a Tsawwassen First Nation land
        title or land registry system:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        i. for Tsawwassen Lands that are not registered in the Land Title
        Office; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent3">
        ii. for interests that are not recognized under Federal or Provincial
        Law;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        f. provision of services in relation to Tsawwassen Lands;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        g. expropriation for public purposes or public works by Tsawwassen First
        Nation of estates or interests in Tsawwassen Lands, if Tsawwassen First
        Nation provides fair compensation to the owner of the estate or
        interest; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        h. the approval of proposed developments on Tsawwassen Lands.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. Despite subclause 1.g, Tsawwassen First Nation may not expropriate:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. estates or interests granted or continued on the Effective Date where
        expropriation is precluded under the terms and conditions of those
        estates or interests;
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. estates or interests expropriated by Canada or British Columbia after
        the Effective Date; or
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        c. estates or interests granted or continued on the Effective Date to a
        provincial ministry or agent of the provincial Crown or for the use of a
        Public Utility, whether or not an agent of the Crown, that would
        otherwise have authority to expropriate an estate or interest in land
        under provincial legislation or on whose behalf British Columbia may
        expropriate.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. For greater certainty, subclause 2.c describes an exception to the
        Tsawwassen Government law making authority in respect of expropriation
        and does not and is not intended to address the authority of a
        Provincial Expropriating Authority to expropriate under provincial
        legislation which authority is dealt with in the Lands chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. Tsawwassen Government may exercise authority over agriculture on
        Tsawwassen Lands through land use planning and zoning under subclause
        1.d.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. A Tsawwassen Law made under clause 1 prevails to the extent of a
        Conflict with a Federal or Provincial Law.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        6. Despite clause 5, a Federal or Provincial Law in respect of the
        division of matrimonial real property prevails to the extent of a
        Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of matrimonial
        real property made under subclause 1.a or 1.b. For greater certainty, a
        Tsawwassen Law that may restrict the Disposition of real property to a
        Tsawwassen Member is not a Tsawwassen Law in respect of the division of
        matrimonial real property.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        7. Despite clause 5, except in respect of the Former Tsawwassen Reserve
        and any other Tsawwassen Lands excluded from an agricultural land
        reserve designation, the
        <em> Agricultural Land Commission Act </em>
        prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a Tsawwassen Law made under
        subclause 1.d.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        8. Despite clause 5, a Federal or Provincial Law in relation to
        Environmental Assessment prevails to the extent of a Conflict with a
        Tsawwassen Law made under subclause 1.h.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        9. A Tsawwassen Law under subclause 1.a or 1.b in respect of estates or
        interests that are recognized under Federal or Provincial Law must be
        consistent with common law principles in respect of those interests and,
        for greater certainty, a Tsawwassen Law in respect of a Tsawwassen Fee
        Simple Interest is not inconsistent with common law principles.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        10. Without limiting the scope of authority of Tsawwassen Government to
        make laws under this Agreement, before Tsawwassen Government makes a law
        under subclause 1.d, Tsawwassen First Nation will consult residents of
        Tsawwassen Lands who may be affected by the proposed law, through a
        process similar in principle to that required of a municipality
        undertaking similar law-making.

          PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        11. Despite any approval of a proposed development made by Tsawwassen
        First Nation under subclause 1.h, no Federal Project or Provincial
        Project on Tsawwassen Lands will proceed unless there has been
        compliance with any applicable Federal or Provincial Law in respect of
        Environmental Assessment.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        12. For greater certainty, Tsawwassen First Nation may establish
        administrative procedures for evaluating proposed developments referred
        to in subclause 1.h, including the environmental effects of the
        developments.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        13. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
        participating in processes or institutions, including processes or
        institutions that may address matters of shared decision-making, or
        benefiting from future provincial programs, policies or initiatives of
        general application to First Nations as British Columbia develops a new
        relationship with First Nations.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        14. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
        participating in, or benefiting from, federal or provincial
        benefit-sharing programs of general application, in accordance with
        general criteria established for those programs from time to time.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        15. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Tsawwassen First Nation from
        entering into arrangements that are consistent with this Agreement, with
        willing third parties, in order to further economic opportunities for
        Tsawwassen First Nation.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        16. British Columbia will invite Tsawwassen First Nation to participate
        in any provincial land use planning process affecting Tsawwassen
        Territory on the following bases:
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        a. Tsawwassen First Nation will be consulted and may participate in the
        same capacity as a Local Government, a First Nation or as a member of
        the public, as the case may be; and
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent2">
        b. British Columbia will provide Tsawwassen First Nation with the
        decision resulting from any such process and the reasons for that
        decision.
