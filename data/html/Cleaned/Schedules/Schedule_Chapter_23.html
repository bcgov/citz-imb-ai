         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            15. The Parties recognize and acknowledge that this Agreement provides a foundation for an ongoing relationship among the Parties and commit to conducting a periodic review of this Agreement in accordance with clauses 16 through 23.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            16. Sixty days before each Periodic Review Date, each Party will provide the other Parties with written notice if the Party wishes to discuss a matter contemplated by clause 17 and if no notice is provided the Parties will forgo engaging in a review for that Review Period.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            17. The purpose of the periodic review is to provide an opportunity for the Parties to meet and discuss:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. the practicability of the harmonization of the legal and administrative systems of Canada and British Columbia with those of Tsawwassen First Nation, including law-making authorities that are being exercised by Tsawwassen First Nation under this Agreement;

         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            18. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the discussion under clause 17 will take place on the Periodic Review Date and such other dates as the Parties agree, but will not exceed the applicable Review Period, and within 60 days of the end of that discussion each Party will provide the other Parties with its written response on any matter discussed during that Review Period.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            19. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the periodic review and all discussions and information relating to the matter of the periodic review are without prejudice to the respective legal positions of the Parties.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            20. Nothing made or done in respect of a periodic review, including the discussions or the responses provided by the Parties, creates any legally binding rights or obligations.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            21. Except for the commitment of the Parties to meet and provide written responses as set out in clause 18, neither the periodic review process nor the decisions or actions of the Parties relating in any way to the periodic review process are:
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            a. subject to the process set out in the Dispute Resolution chapter; or
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent2">
            b. reviewable by a court or in any other forum.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            22. For greater certainty, none of the Parties is required to agree to amend this Agreement or any agreement contemplated by this Agreement as a result of a periodic review. Where the Parties agree to amend this Agreement, any such amendment will be made in accordance with this chapter. Where the Parties agree to amend an agreement contemplated by this Agreement, the agreement will be amended in accordance with its terms.
         </p>
         <p class="schIndent1">
            23. Each of the Parties will be responsible for its own costs in relation to a periodic review process.
