                  If there are any legislative changes to the Act that are not in force as of December
                  31, 1996, these are identified in

                  provisions of the Act. The "Citation" column identifies the amending legislation by
                  its citation in the 1996 Statute Revision Supplement.

                  The second part of the table provides a legislative history of each section of the
                  Act between the 1979 Statute Revision and the 1996 Statute Revision. The "Section"
                  column identifies all sections of the Act in force on December 31, 1996. The "History"
                  column for each section begins with the citation of the section immediately before
                  the 1996 Statute Revision. This is followed by a list of citations for the legislation
                  that enacted or amended the section between the 1979 Statute Revision and the 1996
                  Statute Revision (if a section was repealed and replaced during that period, these
                  last citations begin at the most recent replacement).
