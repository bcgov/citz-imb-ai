        <strong>
          Do not cancel your existing policy until the new policy is in force
          and you accept it.
        </strong>
        Before you cancel your life insurance policy you should have answers to
        the questions below. Ask any insurance agent or broker, or an
        independent person, for help if you need it.

        <strong> Questions about your present life insurance policy </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. Why do you want to replace your policy? Is the new policy better for
        you? How?
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. Should you just buy more insurance or change your policy? How much
        will these changes cost?
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. When should you cancel your present policy? When will your next
        annual dividend be paid? Will the timing affect your cancellation
        charges?
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. Will you pay more income tax if you cancel your present policy?

          Questions on the advantages and disadvantages of a new life insurance
          policy
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        1. Do you understand the type of insurance policy you are buying? Is it
        a
        <em> term life </em>
        ,
        <em> whole life </em>
        , or
        <em> universal life </em>
        insurance policy? You should know the differences.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        2. Are there times when the new policy will not pay all the benefits
        that your present policy does? Examples are suicide and contestable
        periods and contractual exclusions.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        3. Will the new policy pay as much as your present policy? Examples are
        death benefits, cash values, and dividends.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        4. Does the new policy have the same extra, or optional, benefits as
        your present policy? Examples are waiver of premium, guaranteed
        insurability, accidental death, and family member riders.
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        5. Are there cancellation charges on the new policy?
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        6. What guarantees apply to your present and proposed policies? Which
        policy has the best guarantees?
      </p>
      <p class="schIndent1">
        7. Will either of the policy premiums (payments) increase? For how long
        will the premiums stay the same? How much will they increase?
