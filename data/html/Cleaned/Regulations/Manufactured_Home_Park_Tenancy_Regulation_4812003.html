        (1) The terms of this tenancy agreement and any changes or additions to
        the terms may not contradict or change any right or obligation under the
        <em> Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act </em>
        or a regulation made under that Act, or any standard term. If a term of

        and ends on December 31, 2021, the landlord may increase the rent for
        the existing tenant. The landlord may only increase the rent 12 months
        after the date that the existing rent was established with the tenant or
        12 months after the date of the last legal rent increase for the tenant,
        even if there is a new landlord or a new tenant by way of an assignment.
        The landlord must use the approved Notice of Rent Increase form
        available from any Residential Tenancy office or Government Agent.
      </p>

          example, the months are February, March and April, so the increase
          would begin on May 1st.]
