          1.1 — The Muskwa-Kechika Management Area
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Muskwa-Kechika Management Area encompasses an area of approximately
        4.45&nbsp;million hectares of Crown land where extensive boreal plains
        and muskeg of the east meet the Rocky Mountains of the west. It is
        bounded on the south by the Needham Creek drainage in the Misinchinka
        Range, on the west by the Rocky Mountains, on the east by the Muskwa and
        Halfway Plateaus and on the north by the Liard Plain. The area overlaps
        the Fort Nelson and Fort St. John Land and Resource Management Planning
        areas.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The area includes parts of the Alberta plateau, the Rocky Mountain
        Foothills, the Liard Plateau, and the Liard Plain. The topography of the
        area rises from the vast flat Alberta plateau up the rolling foothill
        landscapes to the rugged height of the Rocky Mountains. The river
        systems run straight, meander and braid their way through the deeply cut
        bedrock of the mountains. This entire region is within the Arctic
        watershed and is largely drained by the Liard, Muskwa, Toad, Kechika and
        Sikanni Chief Rivers.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        It is one of the few remaining large, intact and almost unroaded
        wilderness areas south of the 60th parallel. It supports a diverse
        number of large mammals including moose, elk, mule deer, whitetail deer,
        caribou, plains bison, mountain sheep, mountain goat, wolves, black
        bears and grizzly bears in population densities of global importance.
        Few places in the world match the natural features of the Muskwa-Kechika
        Management Area in terms of species groupings, remoteness and minimal
        development. The area is also well endowed with rich energy and mineral
        resources. In general, oil and gas reserves dominate the eastern portion
        of the area while a variety of metallic and non-metallic resources can
        be found in the central and western portions of the area. Valuable
        timber resources are also present in the southern portion of the area.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        There are numerous First Nations groups within the area including the
        Fort Nelson First Nation, Prophet River First Nation, Kaska Dena First
        Nation, Lower Post First Nation and the Halfway River Band. A portion of
        the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area is within the area covered by
        Treaty&nbsp;8.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Fort Nelson-Liard and Peace Regional Districts are within the
        Muskwa-Kechika Management Area and include the settlements of Toad River
        and Muncho Lake.

      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Objectives for the management of the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area were
        developed as part of the Fort Nelson and Fort St. John Land and Resource
        Management Plans. Participants in these processes recommended that the
        objectives for the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area be formally designated
        establishing a separate jurisdiction: the Muskwa-Kechika Management
        Area. The Muskwa-Kechika Management Plan identifies objectives for the
        management of the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area and specifies an
        integrated and coordinated planning structure to meet these objectives.
        Sections&nbsp;2.0 to 6.0 describe the management framework and
        sections&nbsp;7.0 to 10.0 specify the objectives for management.

      <p align="left">
        The Muskwa-Kechika Management Plan will be implemented by all relevant
        government agencies through agency-specific management activities, local
        strategic plans, resource development permits and Crown land and natural
        resource dispositions. Development plans and permits will be consistent
        with the objectives and strategies of resource management zones and any
        local strategic plans as specified in the Management Plan.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Local strategic plans will include a description of the linkages to the
        Muskwa-Kechika Management Plan and an explanation of how the local
        strategic plan meets the objectives and strategies outlined in this
        plan. Conversely, it is recognized that the resource management zone
        objectives and strategies in this plan may be amended in the future
        based on feedback from local strategic plans.
