        Schedule A

      <p align="left">
        The
        <em> Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act </em>
        imposes disclosure requirements on credit grantors who extend credit in
        the ordinary course of carrying on their businesses. However, the credit
        grantor under the proposed credit agreement is not extending credit in
        the ordinary course of carrying on business. Consequently, many of the
        disclosure requirements of the
        <em> Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act </em>
        will not apply to this credit agreement such that statements which would
        otherwise be provided to a borrower under that Act will not be made
        available to a borrower in respect of this agreement. I,
        .............................................................. , am the
        loan broker for this credit agreement and, as such, am required to, and
        will, provide the borrower with an initial disclosure statement before
        the borrower enters into the credit agreement.
