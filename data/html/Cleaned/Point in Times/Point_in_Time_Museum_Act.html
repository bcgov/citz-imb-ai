                  If, in the opinion of the board, the directions, terms or trusts imposed by a donor, settlor, transferor or testator are no longer in the best interests of the corporation, the board may apply to a judge of the Supreme Court for an order authorizing a variation of the directions, terms or trusts that the court, having in mind the intent of the donor, settlor, transferor or testator, considers will best further both that intent and the best interests of the corporation.
