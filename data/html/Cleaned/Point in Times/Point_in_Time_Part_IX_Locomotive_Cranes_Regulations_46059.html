                     All boilers should be thoroughly washed as often as the water conditions require, but not less frequently than once each month. All boilers shall be considered as having been in continuous service between washouts, unless the dates of the days that the boiler was out of service are properly certified on washout reports and the report of inspection.

						Cab lights — Each locomotive used between sunset and sunrise shall have cab lamps which will provide sufficient illumination for the air and other gauges to enable the enginemen to make necessary and accurate readings from their usual and proper positions in the cab. These lights shall be so located and constructed that the light will shine only on those parts requiring illumination. Locomotive cranes used in road service shall have an additional lamp conveniently located to enable the person operating the locomotive crane to easily and accurately read train orders and timetables and so constructed that it may be darkened or extinguished.
