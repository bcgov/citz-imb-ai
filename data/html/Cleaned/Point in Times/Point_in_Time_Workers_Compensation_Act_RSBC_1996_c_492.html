                     In addition to the other compensation provided by this Part, the Board may furnish or provide for the injured worker any medical, surgical, hospital, nursing and other care or treatment, transportation, medicines, crutches and apparatus, including artificial members, that it may consider reasonably necessary at the time of the injury, and thereafter during the disability to cure and relieve from the effects of the injury or alleviate those effects, and the Board may adopt rules and regulations with respect to furnishing health care to injured workers entitled to it and for the payment of it. The Board may make a daily allowance to an injured worker for the worker's subsistence when, under its direction, the worker is undergoing treatment at a place other than the place where he or she resides, and the power of the Board to make a daily allowance for subsistence under this section extends to an injured worker who receives compensation, regardless of the date the
              worker first became entitled to compensation.

                     The maximum wage rate to be determined under subsection (7) must be an amount that the Board thinks represents the same relationship to the sum of $11 200 as the annual average of wages and salaries in the Province for the year preceding that in which the determination is made bears to the annual average of wages and salaries for the year 1972; and the resulting figure may be rounded to the nearest $100.
