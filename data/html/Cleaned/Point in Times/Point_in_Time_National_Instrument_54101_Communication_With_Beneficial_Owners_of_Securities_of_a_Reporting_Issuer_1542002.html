          <p>
            1. I require a list in the required format of the non-objecting
            beneficial owners of securities of

            on whose behalf intermediaries hold securities (a&nbsp;NOBO list),

          <p>
            3. I undertake that, except as permitted under National Instrument
            54-101, the NOBO list will not be used to send securityholder
            materials to those NOBOs that are identified on the NOBO list as
            having chosen not to receive the materials, and that the materials
            sent shall include the following statement:

            materials directly to you, your name and address and information
