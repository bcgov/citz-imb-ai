                  — If successive phases of work are recommended, each phase must culminate in a decision point. The recommendations shall not apply to more than two phases of work. The recommendations shall state whether advancing to a subsequent phase is contingent on positive results in the previous phase. Provide particulars of the recommended programs and a breakdown of costs for each phase. A technical report that contains recommendations for expenditures on exploration or development work on a property shall include a statement by a qualified person that, in the qualified person's opinion, the character of the property is of sufficient merit to justify the program recommended.
