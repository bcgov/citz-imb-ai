          </p>
          <p>
            The following ocean currents metering information is required for
            registration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The currents regime at the site must be characterized at 2 depths:
            approximately 15 metres below the surface and approximately 5 metres
            above the bottom. Current direction must be measured in degrees true
            and current speed in centimetres per second. Speed and direction
            must be recorded at least once every 30 minutes for a period of at
            least 30 days. The locations where currents are metered must
            represent currents within the tenure, especially near containment
            structures and containment structure arrays. Follow the protocols
            for collecting currents data that appear in Section 1 of Protocols
            for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002).

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> A. Seabed Characterization </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A baseline survey of the seabed within the tenure and at at least 2
            reference stations is required. The baseline survey must achieve the
            following objectives:
          </p>
          <p class="schIndent1">
            • describe variation in substrata, topography and bathymetry
            throughout the tenure and at reference stations
          </p>
          <p class="schIndent1">
            • locate reference stations with similar depths, substrata and other
            features
          </p>
          <p class="schIndent1">
            • determine the feasibility of collecting sediment grab samples and
            identify areas that need video survey for operational monitoring
          </p>
          <p class="schIndent1">
            • collect physical and biological data to compare with data
            collected during the operational period and to estimate the number
            of samples needed for operational monitoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surveys of the probable footprints for all proposed locations of the
            containment structures, or containment structure arrays, are
            required. They must include enough transects to map all biophysical
            characteristics to a resolution of 50 metres. To describe depth
            variation, at least one transect must run perpendicular to the shore
            starting from the landward boundary of the tenure and running to its
            opposite perimeter.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> B. Video Survey </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each reference station must have 2 video transects, each at least
            100 metres long, including one perpendicular to shore. The transects
            must run straight, with start and end points recorded for future
            reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surveys must characterize substratum types as bedrock, boulder
            (&gt;256 millimetres in diameter), cobble (64-256 millimetres in
            diameter), gravel (2-64 millimetres in diameter), sand (0.0625-2
            millimetres in diameter), silt, mud and clay (&lt;0.0625 millimetres
            in diameter), or shell hash. For combination substrata, relative
            proportions must be noted (e.g. 50% bedrock: 50% boulder). Some will
            have associations of organisms or other features which must be
            identified.
          </p>
          <p>
            In areas where sediment grab sampling is not possible, the
            abundances of megafauna, macrofauna and macrophytes must be
            measured. For megafauna, record moving images along transects. For
            macrofauna, take still images of quadrats. For macrophytes, use
            both. There must be enough quadrats to adequately represent each
            substratum type within all probable footprints. At reference
            stations, 5 quadrats must be sampled midway on the transects. All
            images, whether moving or still, must be clear enough for counting
            and measuring the biota cover. All biota must be taxonomically
            identified to at least the level of class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sediment colour and the presence or absence of fish feed, fish
            faeces, flocculent organic material, macrophytes, terrigenous
            material and farm litter must also be recorded for each transect and
            quadrat. These observations are needed for proper comparison with
            observations made during operational monitoring. Unique seabed
            features or areas of interest must also be mapped.
          </p>
          <p>
            The baseline survey must follow the protocols for video surveys in
            section 2 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP
            2002) unless an alternative method has been authorized by a
            director, and the alternative method will meet the objectives for
            the baseline survey set out at the beginning of this Part.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> C. Sediment Sampling </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Following conduct of the video or alternate survey, sediment grab
            sampling is required wherever physically possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grab sampling obtains physical, chemical and biological data to be
            used to determine the number of samples needed for operational
            monitoring and to be compared against the operational data. Within
            each of the probable footprint or accumulated probable footprints a
            minimum of 3 grab samples must be taken for each sediment type and
            if only one sediment type is present, then a minimum of 5 grab
            samples must be taken. Two reference stations must be selected (as
            described for video surveys above) and at least 3 grabs must be
            taken at each reference station. Follow the sediment sampling
            protocols in Sections 3 and 4 of Protocols for Marine Environmental
            Monitoring (WLAP 2002).
          </p>
          <p>
            The following physical and chemical parameters must be measured
            whenever a sediment grab sample is taken:
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Biota must be taxonomically identified to the level of species and
            counted. Also identify and count individuals of Capitella. After
            being processed, samples must be archived for at least 5 years.
            These samples must be properly stored and maintained.

            <strong> Part III — Reporting </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The location of each substratum type, currents metering, facility
            sampling stations, reference stations and transects must be reported
            on maps. Appropriate scale must be used for easy identification.
            Qualified professionals providing positional information must be
            aware that DGPS is not always available to adequate resolution (± 10
            m) because of the topography of adjacent land or for other reasons.
            Therefore, alternative methods of positioning may be needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another map must show depths across the tenure and at reference
            stations. Map contours must be at a maximum of 10-metre intervals
            (or equivalent intervals expressed in alternative units). Marine
            charts may be used, provided that they report the 10-metre depth
            interval and are accurate for the specific site. However, companies
            may choose to collect their own bottom contour information if
            accurate charts are not available, or to be consistent with other
            information, such as a profile view of the facility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data submissions for currents metering (at both depths) must

          <p class="schIndent1">
            • electronic files of the raw data, indicating current speed and

            distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data must be provided in an electronic ASCII or MS Excel file
            format. The data must also be accompanied by adequate reporting
            information as indicated below. The hard-copy summaries must show
            current speed and current direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both raw data and summary data must include measurements made
            between the first and the last good record time only. All data
            recorded before or after complete deployment of the meter must be
            removed prior to submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Videotape submissions must be accompanied by a detailed narrative or
            written assessment prepared by a qualified professional describing
            benthic conditions along transects and in quadrats. The video and
            report must identify the location of each transect and the location
            of the camera along each transect.

          <p>
            All physical, chemical and biological data gathered from video
            surveys and sediment sampling must be submitted in a standard

          <p>
            The main purposes of operational monitoring are to determine whether
            a facility meets chemical and biological requirements and standards,
            and to define the spatial and temporal extent of the facility's
            effects. All monitoring programs must have the basic study design
            features described in Section 7 and Appendices of Protocols for
            Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002). Any additional design
            features must be provided by a qualified professional.

          <p>
            The probable footprint of the waste discharges must be determined
            prior to designing the impact study. Methods to estimate that

            techniques, reconnaissance grab sampling, hydrodynamic modeling or
            other methods.

            <strong> Part I — Hard Bottom Survey </strong>

          <p>
            If satisfactory sediment samples cannot be obtained using grab
            samplers — because of hard surfaces, rocks or other coarse material
            — perform a video survey, or an alternative hard bottom survey if an

            2002).
          </p>
          <p>
            For video surveys, the following 2 types of video surveys must be
            conducted:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Megafauna transect survey </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This identifies and quantifies megafauna and macrophytes from moving
            images obtained along transects. These transects may also be used to
            define the extent of observable physical and biological changes,
            such as sediment colour, presence of organic sediments, feed
            pellets, farm litter or Beggiatoa mats.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Macrofauna quadrat survey </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This consists of still images of quadrats used to identify and
            quantify macrofauna and macrophytes. These are normally on or
            adjacent to the megafauna transect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each transect must start at the perimeter of the containment
            structure, or containment structure array, and extend to the
            perimeter of the tenure, along the prevailing current. There must be
            one transect for each of 2 dominant current directions of each
            containment structure or array. If adjacent containment structures,
            or arrays, are less than 60 m apart, they must be treated as if they
            were a single array when transects are positioned. A transect must
            not extend beneath an adjacent containment structure or array.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternate transect designs might be acceptable, provided that there
            is adequate supporting information to show that the transects
            represent the spatial extent and magnitude of effects, considering
            the tenure's currents regimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each transect place at least 5 macrofauna quadrats at each of
            these stations: perimeter of containment structure or array, 30
            metres from the zero metre stations and on the perimeter of the
            tenure.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least 2 reference stations must be surveyed, with one transect at
            least 100 metres long at each. These must be the same reference
            stations as those surveyed during baseline inventory, or for
            existing sites, established for the Interim Monitoring Program 2000.
            In the absence of established sites documentation must be provided
            to show the reference sites meet the criteria in Section 2 B of
            Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002).
          </p>
          <p>
            Data analyses must be performed according to the statistical
            protocols described in Section 7 of Protocols for Marine
            Environmental Monitoring (WLAP 2002) to determine whether the
            facility has had any statistically significant effects.

          </p>
          <p>
            Sediment sampling also requires a transect approach. Each transect
            must start at the perimeter of the containment structure, or
            containment structure array, and extend along the dominant currents
            to the perimeter of the tenure. There must be one transect for each
            of 2 dominant current directions for each containment structure or
            array. If adjacent containment structures, or arrays, are less than
            60 m apart, they must be treated as if they were a single array when
            transects are positioned. A transect must not extend beneath an
            adjacent containment structure or array.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each transect must have sampling stations located at the perimeter
            of the containment structure at 30 metres from the zero metre
            station and at the tenure perimeter. A zero metre station must be
            established for each transect. Each 30 metre station must be located
            along the dominant current using DGPS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternate transect designs might be acceptable, provided that there

            represent the spatial extent and magnitude of effects, considering
            the tenure's currents regime(s). Two or more reference stations must
            be sampled at the same locations as those surveyed for baseline
            inventory, or for existing sites, established for the Interim
            Monitoring Program 2000. In the absence of established sites

            The following physical and chemical parameters must be measured at
            the perimeter of containment structures, or of containment structure
            arrays and at reference stations during operational monitoring:

            Free sulphide and redox potential monitoring must be also conducted
            at stations at 30 metres from the zero metre station, and at the
            perimeter of the tenure.
          </p>
          <p>
            A minimum of 3 grab samples must be taken at each station. If the
            mean free sulphide concentration of the 3 grabs at a given facility
            station exceeds a requirement or standard (not statistically), then
            2 additional grabs must be taken for sulphides and redox potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where biological sediment samples are needed, the abundance of
            infauna and epifauna must be quantified. Within the tenure, at least
            5 sediment grabs are needed for each station. At each reference
            station, at least 3 grabs are needed. Biota must be taxonomically
            identified to at least the level of family. Also identify
            individuals of Capitella. After processing, samples must be archived
            for at least 5 years. These samples need to be properly stored and
            maintained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perform data analyses according to the protocols described in
            Section 7 of Protocols for Marine Environmental Monitoring (WLAP
            2002) to determine whether the facility has had any statistically
            significant effects.
