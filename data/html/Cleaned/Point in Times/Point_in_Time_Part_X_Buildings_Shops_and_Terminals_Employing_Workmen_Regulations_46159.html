                     Inspectors shall, whenever it is deemed necessary, and they shall, before a boiler is put into service, and at least once a year thereafter, subject each and every boiler as set forth in this Part to a hydrostatic test of at least 25% and not more than 50% of the working pressure allowed, using water at a temperature of between 60 and 100° Fahrenheit. The pressures shall be under proper control. During hydrostatic tests, the safety valve or valves shall be removed or each valve disk shall be held to its seat by means of a testing clamp and not by screwing down the compression screw upon the spring.
