               </p>
               <p>
                  (b) because my contract of life insurance was purchased at a younger age, I may pay more for a new contract having the same or similar benefits;
               </p>
               <p>
                  (c) as the incontestable and suicide clauses begin to run again in a new contract, a claim may be denied under a new contract which would have been paid under the contract replaced;
               </p>
               <p>
                  (d) as a change in my health may have adversely affected my insurability, a new contract may contain certain restrictions or limitations and may be more costly;
               </p>
               <p>
                  (e) policy conditions or benefits, including the interest rate on policy loans, may be more favourable under the existing contract of life insurance to be replaced;
               </p>
               <p>
                  (f) if the transaction to purchase a new contract(s) of life insurance involves borrowing the cash value of my existing contract(s) of life insurance beyond my expected ability or intention to repay the loan, a loss or reduction of the benefits under my existing contract(s) of life insurance will result;
               </p>
               <p>
                  (g) by replacing or changing my contract of life insurance acquired prior to December 2, 1982, or in the case of corporate owned life insurance prior to June 29, 1982, I may lose valuable tax advantages within the existing policy.
               </p>
               <p>
                  A copy of this disclosure form will be sent to the life insurers which issued the contract(s) of life insurance to be replaced.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I also acknowledge receipt of a fully completed Disclosure Statement Regarding Replacement of Contracts of Life Insurance and acknowledge that it was presented to me before the application for new insurance was signed.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I have been advised by the agent who signed this form that I may withdraw, in writing, my application for new insurance within 20 days and that the insurer will refund any premium deposit or other payment made by me in respect of the proposed replacement of a contract of life insurance, except if the application is for a single premium life insurance policy, or a policy the value of which depends upon a stated rate of interest and/or a stated group of assets, in which case the refund shall be adjusted to reflect the change in the capital value of the contract.
