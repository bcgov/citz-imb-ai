                  (1) If the transferor signature cannot be certified by an officer, enter "SEE AFFIDAVIT OF EXECUTION" and attach an affidavit that complies with Part 5 of the
                  <em>
                     Land Title Act
                  </em>
                  . Note that the affidavit will be part of Form A and must have a page number.
               </p>
               <p class="schIndent1">
                  (2) The affidavit must state the reason why officer certification cannot be obtained. The reason must be sufficient for the registrar to accept the affidavit in lieu of the officer certification. In those cases where the affidavit evidence of execution is submitted, the registrar is not likely to exercise his discretion unless officer certification is simply impossible to obtain under the circumstances or the transfer was executed outside British Columbia.
               </p>
               <p class="schIndent1">
                  (3) In those cases where the freehold transfer document is executed outside British Columbia, the registrar will accept that it is difficult to obtain an officer's certification in all cases and will accept the affidavit of execution in lieu of an officer certification.

               <p class="schIndent1">
                  (1) If the borrower signature cannot be certified by an officer, enter "SEE AFFIDAVIT OF EXECUTION" and attach an affidavit that complies with Part 5 of the
                  <em>
                     Land Title Act
                  </em>

               <p class="schIndent1">
                  (2) The affidavit must state the reason why officer certification cannot be obtained. The reason must be sufficient for the registrar to accept the affidavit in lieu of the officer certification. In those cases where the affidavit evidence of execution is submitted, the registrar is not likely to exercise his discretion unless officer certification is simply impossible to obtain under the circumstances or the mortgage was executed outside British Columbia.
               </p>
               <p class="schIndent1">
                  (3) In those cases where the mortgage document is executed outside British Columbia, the registrar will accept that it is difficult to obtain an officer certification in all cases and will accept the affidavit of execution in lieu of an officer certification.

                  (1) If the transferor(s)/transferee(s) signature(s) cannot be certified by an officer, enter "SEE AFFIDAVIT OF EXECUTION" and attach an affidavit that complies with Part 5 of the
                  <em>
                     Land Title Act
                  </em>
                  . Note that the affidavit is part of Form C and must have a page number.

               <p class="schIndent1">
                  (2) The affidavit must state the reason why officer certification cannot be obtained. The reason must be sufficient for the registrar to accept the affidavit in lieu of the officer certification. In those cases where the affidavit evidence of execution is submitted, the registrar is not likely to exercise his discretion unless officer certification is simply impossible to obtain under the circumstances or the general instrument was executed outside British Columbia.

               <p class="schIndent1">
                  (3) In those cases where the general instrument is executed outside British Columbia, the registrar will accept that it is difficult to obtain an officer certification in all cases and will accept the affidavit of execution in lieu of an officer certification.
