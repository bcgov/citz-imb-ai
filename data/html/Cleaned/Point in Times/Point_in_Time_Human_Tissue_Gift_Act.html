              person is imminent by reason of injury or disease and the medical
              practitioner has reason to believe that section&nbsp;9 of the
              <em> Coroners Act </em>
              may apply when death does occur and a consent under this Part has
              been obtained for a post mortem transplant of tissue from the
              body, a coroner having jurisdiction, even though that death has
              not yet occurred, may give directions the medical practitioner
              thinks proper for the removal of that tissue after the death of
              the person, and every direction given has the same effect as if it
              had been made after death under section&nbsp;38&nbsp;(3) of the
              <em> Coroners Act </em>
