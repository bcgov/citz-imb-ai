              For the purposes of subsection (2) (b), the flat rate fee is
              determined by multiplying the number of months in the period that
              starts on the date that is 7 months and one day after the
              institution's fiscal year end for the 2015/2016 fiscal year and
              ends on the date the remaining certificate term ends by the
              monthly flat rate set out in column 2 of Table 2 of the Schedule
              to the Fees and Student Tuition Protection Fund Regulation
              opposite the institution's annual tuition revenue in column 1.
