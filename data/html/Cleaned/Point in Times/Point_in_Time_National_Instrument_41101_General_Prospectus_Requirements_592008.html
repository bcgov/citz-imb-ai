               </p>
               <p>
                  The regulators collect the personal information in Schedule 1 for the purpose of enabling the regulators to administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities legislation, including those provisions that require or permit the regulators to refuse to issue a receipt for a prospectus if it appears to the regulators that the past conduct of management or promoters of the Issuer affords reasonable grounds for belief that the business of the Issuer will not be conducted with integrity and in the best interests of its securityholders.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You understand that by signing the certificate and consent in Schedule 1, you are consenting to the Issuer submitting your personal information in Schedule 1 (the "Information") to the regulators and to the collection and use by the regulators of the Information, as well as any other information that may be necessary to administer and enforce provincial and territorial securities legislation. This may include the collection of information from law enforcement agencies, other government or non-governmental regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations, exchanges, and quotation and trade reporting systems in order to conduct background checks, verify the Information and perform investigations and conduct enforcement proceedings as required to ensure compliance with provincial and territorial securities legislation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You understand that the Issuer is required to deliver the Information to the regulators because the Issuer has filed a prospectus under provincial and territorial securities legislation. You also understand that you have a right to be informed of the existence of personal information about you that is kept by regulators, that you have the right to request access to that information, and that you have the right to request that such information be corrected, subject to the applicable provisions of the freedom of information and protection of privacy legislation adopted by each province and territory.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You also understand and agree that the Information the regulators collect about you may also be disclosed, as permitted by law, where its use and disclosure is for the purposes described above. The regulators may also use a third party to process the Information, but when this happens, the third party will be carefully selected and obligated to comply with the limited use restrictions described above and with provincial and federal privacy legislation.

                     In determining the degree of detail required, a standard of materiality must be applied. Materiality is a matter of judgment in the particular circumstance, and is determined in relation to an Item 's significance to investors, analysts and other users of the information. An Item of information, or an aggregate of items, is considered material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement would influence or change an investment decision with respect to the issuer's securities. In determining whether information is material, take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. The potential significance of items must be considered individually rather than on a net basis, if the items have an offsetting effect. This concept of materiality is consistent with the financial reporting notion of materiality contained in the Handbook.

                        There may be factors relating to a security that are not addressed by a ratings agency when they give a rating. For example, in the case of cash settled derivative instruments, factors in addition to the creditworthiness of the issuer, such as the continued subsistence of the underlying interest or the volatility of the price, value or level of the underlying interest may be reflected in the rating analysis. Rather than being addressed in the rating itself, these factors may be described by an approved rating organization by way of a superscript or other notation to a rating. Any such attributes must be discussed in the disclosure under this section.

The issuer and the underwriters can only do that if they give a contractual right to investors in the event the marketing materials contain a misrepresentation.

                  None of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities or Canadian exchanges regulates activities of any foreign markets, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, or has the power to compel enforcement of the rule of a foreign market or any applicable foreign law. Generally, any foreign transaction will be governed by applicable foreign laws. This is true even if the foreign market is formally linked to a Canadian market so that a position taken on a market may be liquidated by a transaction on another market. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary depending on the foreign country in which the transaction occurs.

                  <em>
                     (5) For a group scholarship plan or other type of scholarship plan that normally calculates the sales charge payable as a fixed dollar amount linked to the amount of contribution by a subscriber (i.e. $x.xx per unit), in addition to stating the fixed amount of sales charge per unit as required under Instruction (3), the disclosure of the amount of the sales charge in the table titled "Fees you pay" in the column titled "What you pay" must also be expressed as a percentage of the cost of a unit of the scholarship plan. If the total cost of a unit of the scholarship plan varies depending on the contribution option or frequency selected, the percentage sales charge must be expressed as a range, between the lowest and the highest percentage of the unit cost the sales charge can represent, based on the different contribution options available to subscribers under the scholarship plan. This must be calculated as follows: (i) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the highest total cost per unit, and (ii) divide the sales charge per unit by the contribution option that has the lowest total cost per unit. For example, if a scholarship plan calculates its sales charge as $200/unit, and the total cost per unit for a subscriber can range from $1 000 to $5 000 (based on the different options available to subscribers), the percentage range of the sales charge disclosed in the table would be 4% (200/5000) to 20% (200/1000). The disclosure in the table must also state that the exact percentage of the sales charge per unit for a subscriber will depend on the contribution option selected for contributing to the scholarship plan and how old their beneficiary is at the time they open the scholarship plan.
