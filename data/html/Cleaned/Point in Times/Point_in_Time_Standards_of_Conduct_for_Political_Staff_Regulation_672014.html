                  "Political staff" are persons appointed under section 15(1)(a) of the
                  <em>
                     Public Service Act
                  </em>
                  who report through to the Chief of Staff to the Premier or provide support to a Minister, and who are not assigned job duties primarily of an administrative, technical or communications nature. Most appointees working in the Office of the Premier and supporting Ministers' offices are political staff (e.g., Chiefs of Staff, Ministerial Assistants and Executive Assistants). Appointees to Government Communications and Public Engagement are not political staff. See
                  <u>
                     Schedule 1

                  Political staff will exhibit the highest standards of conduct. Their conduct must instil confidence and trust and not bring the Province of British Columbia into disrepute.
               </p>
               <p align="left" xmlns:act="http://www.gov.bc.ca/2013/legislation/act" xmlns:oasis="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/oasis-exchange/table" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                  The requirement to comply with these standards of conduct is a condition of employment. Political staff who fail to comply with these standards may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.

                  The Standards of Conduct for Political Staff closely resemble the

                     Standards of Conduct applicable to employees of the BC Public Service
                  </u>
                  . However, the Standards of Conduct for Political Staff recognize the unique, partisan role performed by political staff and provide guidance on how political staff may exercise their partisan duties while also respecting the non-partisan role of employees in the BC Public Service.

                  Political staff are generally employed to help Ministers on matters where the non-political and political work of Government overlap and where it would be inappropriate for permanent public servants to become involved. Political staff serve as advisors and assistants who share the ruling party's political commitment, and who can complement the professional, expert and non-partisan advice and support of the permanent public service.

                  Many political staff report directly to their Minister's Chief of Staff, who is responsible for the overall management of the Minister's Office including managing the office budget and personnel. Political staff should ask their Chief of Staff, or other manager or supervisor to whom they report, if they have any questions regarding their role and responsibilities.
